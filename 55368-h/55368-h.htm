<h4>I</h4>

<p class='pindent'>On the 2d day of May 1945, President Truman signed Executive
Order 9547 appointing Justice Robert H. Jackson as Representative
of the United States and as its Chief of Counsel in the preparation
and prosecution of the case against the major Axis war
criminals. Since that date and up to the present, the staff of the
Office of Chief of Counsel, or OCC, has been engaged continuously
in the discovery, collection, examination, translation, and marshalling
of documentary evidence demonstrating the criminality
of the former leaders of the German Reich. Since the 20th day
of November 1945, a considerable part of this documentary arsenal
has been directed against the 22 major Nazi war criminals
who are on trial before the International Military Tribunal in
Nurnberg. As of this writing the American and British cases-in-chief,
on Counts I and II of the Indictment charging, respectively,
conspiracy and the waging of wars of aggression, have
been completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is perhaps no need to recall in these pages that the Nurnberg
trial represents the first time in history that legal proceedings
have been instituted against leaders of an enemy nation. It
is perhaps equal supererogation to state here that there are no
exact precedents for the charges made by the American, British,
French, and Russian prosecutors that to plot or wage a war of
aggression is a crime for which individuals may be punished. Yet
it was because of these very facts that in its indictment the prosecution
presented a challenge to itself quite as great as to the
defense. A heavy burden was laid on the accusing nations to
make sure that their proof measured up to the magnitude of their
accusations, and that the daring of their grand conception was
matched by the industry of their research, lest the hard-bought
opportunity to make International Law a guardian of peace should
fail by default.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not surprising, therefore, that the American collecting and
processing of documentary evidence, under the general direction
of Col. Robert G. Storey, gradually developed into an operation of
formidable scope. Although some pieces of evidence were secured
in Washington and London, by far the greater part was obtained
in the land of the enemy. As the American Armies had swept
into Germany, military investigating teams had filled document
centers with an increasing wealth of materials which were freely
<span class='pageno' title='vi' id='Page_vi'></span>
made available by the Army to OCC field investigators. Special
assistance was given by the Document Section, G-2 Division,
SHAEF, and by the Document Sections of the Army Groups and
Armies operating in the European Theater. OCC investigators
also made valuable discoveries while prospecting on their own.
They soon found themselves embarrassed with riches. Perhaps
foremost among the prize acquisitions was the neatly crated collection
of all the personal and official correspondence of Alfred
Rosenberg, together with a great quantity of Nazi Party correspondence.
This cache was discovered behind a false wall in an
old castle in Eastern Bavaria, where it had been sent for safekeeping.
Another outstanding collection consisted of thirty-nine
leather-bound volumes containing detailed inventories of the art
treasures of Europe which had been looted by the <span class='it'>Einsatzstab
Rosenberg</span>. These catalogues, together with much of the priceless
plunder itself, were found hidden deep in an Austrian salt mine.
An innocent-appearing castle near Marburg was found to contain
some 485 tons of crated papers, which inspection revealed to be
the records of the German Foreign Office from 1837 to 1944.
Among other outstanding bulk acquisitions were more than 300
crates of German High Command files, 85 notebooks containing
minutes of Hitler’s conferences, and the complete files of the
German Navy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The task was to screen thoroughly this abundance of material
so as to overlook no relevant item, and yet at the same time
to obtain the proof and to translate it in season, so as not to
delay preparation of the Indictment or commencement of the trial.
The procedures followed in this process are described in the affidavit
of Maj. William H. Coogan (<span class='it'>001-A-PS</span>), which is listed numerically
among the documents. As a result of those procedures,
more than 100,000 documents were individually examined in order
to segregate those of importance. Of these 100,000 documents,
approximately 4,000 were found to be of clear or potential value.
This group of 4,000 was further reduced through exacting standards
of elimination to a total of some 2,000 documents which it
was proposed to offer in evidence, and which make up the bulk of
this publication. Thus, the documents presented in these volumes
are the fittest survivors of a rigorous sifting. Each of them has
met requirements designed to ensure the selection of only the
most significant in bearing on the American case. Documents
primarily concerned with the report of individual barbarities or
perversions were excluded, in conformity with the emphasis placed
upon those tending to prove elements in the Nazi Master Plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These documents consist, in the main, of official papers found
<span class='pageno' title='vii' id='Page_vii'></span>
in archives of the German Government and Nazi Party, diaries
and letters of prominent Germans, and captured reports and orders.
There are included, in addition, excerpts from governmental
and Party decrees, from official newspapers and from authoritative
German publications. The authenticity of all these materials
is established by Maj. Coogan’s affidavit (<span class='it'>001-A-PS</span>). Considered
together, they reveal a fairly comprehensive view of the inner
workings and outward deeds of the German government and of
the Nazi Party, which were always concealed from the world, and
for which, the world will always hold the Hitler regime in horror
and contempt.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p class='pindent'>It is important that it be clearly understood what this collection
of documents is not. In the first place, it is neither an official
record, nor an unofficial transcript of the trial proceedings. It is
not designed to reproduce what has taken place in court. It is
merely the documentary evidence prepared by the American and
British prosecuting staffs, and is in no wise under the sponsorship
of the Tribunal. It is presented in the belief that this collection
containing the full text of the documents, classified under appropriate
subjects, may be more useful to students of the Nurnberg
trial than the official record, when prepared, may be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason for this goes back to the first few days of the trial,
when the Tribunal ruled that it would treat no written matter
as in evidence unless it was read in full, word by word, in court.
The purpose of the ruling was to enable the documentary material
which the American and British staffs had translated from
German into English to be further translated into Russian and
French through the simultaneous interpreting system in the courtroom.
The consequence, however, was to enforce upon the American
and British prosecution the task of trimming their evidence
drastically unless the trial was to be protracted to an unconscionable
length. Counsel therefore had to content themselves in most
instances with introducing, by reading <span class='it'>verbatim</span>, only the most
vital parts of the documents relied upon. Only these evidentiary
minima appear in the daily transcript, and presumably, since no
more is officially in evidence under the Tribunal’s ruling, no more
can properly be included in the official record. It has frequently
been the case, furthermore, that different parts of certain documents
were read in proof of different allegations, and hence are
scattered throughout the transcript. American counsel, in several
instances, read only sketchy portions of some documents, leaving
other portions, at the request of the French and Soviet delegations,
<span class='pageno' title='viii' id='Page_viii'></span>
to be read later as a part of their case. Still other portions
of the same document will undoubtedly be read later on by the
defense. It is an unavoidable consequence that the transcript itself
will be a thing of shreds and patches, and that any comprehensive
and orderly notion of the documentary evidence must be
obtained elsewhere. The documentary excerpts, when accompanied
by the explanation of trial counsel, are of course sufficient for
the trial and for the judgment of the Tribunal. But the purposes
of historians and scholars will very likely lead them to wish to
examine the documents in their entirety. It is to those long-range
interests that these volumes are in the main addressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, this collection of documents is not the American case.
It is at once more and less than that. It is less, because it of
course cannot include the captured motion picture and still photographic
evidence relied upon, and because it contains only a few
of the organizational charts and visual presentation exhibits utilized
at the trial. It is more, because although it does contain all
the evidence introduced either in part or in whole by the American
staff in proof of Count I, it also includes many documents not
introduced into evidence at all. There were various reasons for
not offering this material to the Tribunal: the documents were
cumulative in nature, better documents were available on the
same point, or the contents did not justify the time required for
reading. (The document index at the end of Volume VIII is marked
to indicate which documents were introduced, either in whole or in
part, in evidence.) Of more than 800 American documents so far
introduced in evidence, a small number were received through
judicial notice or oral summarization, while some 500 were read,
in part or in whole, in court. Approximately 200 more went into
evidence in the first few days of the trial, under an earlier ruling
of the Tribunal which admitted documents without reading, and
merely on filing with the court after proof of authenticity. Of
the documents not now in evidence and thus not before the Tribunal
for consideration in reaching its decision, many have been
turned over to the French and Soviet prosecuting staffs and, by
the time these volumes are published, will have been introduced
in the course of their cases. Others will have been put before the
Tribunal by the American case in rebuttal or utilized in cross-examining
witnesses called by the defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This publication includes a series of affidavits prepared under
the direction of Col. John Harlan Amen, chief of the OCC Interrogation
Division. Those which were introduced into evidence
are listed among the documents in the <span class='it'>PS</span> series. A number of
affidavits which were not offered to the Tribunal are printed in a
<span class='pageno' title='ix' id='Page_ix'></span>
separate section at the end of the document series. Affidavits of
the latter type were prepared in an attempt to eliminate surprise
by delineating clearly the testimony which the affiant might be expected
to give in court, should it be decided to call him as a witness.
In the case of the affiants who testified in court, their affidavits
represent a substantially accurate outline of their testimony
on direct examination. Others of the affiants may, by the
time of publication, have been called as rebuttal witnesses for the
prosecution. In addition, there are included selected statements
of certain defendants and prisoners written to the prosecutors
from prison. It should be mentioned in this connection that as a
result of many months of exhaustive questioning of the defendants,
prisoners of war, and other potential witnesses, the Interrogation
Division has harvested approximately 15,000 typewritten
pages of valuable and previously unavailable information on a
variety of subjects. These extensive transcripts represent approximately
950 individual interrogations and are presently being
edited and catalogued in Nurnberg so that the significant materials
may be published in a useful form and within a manageable
scope, as a supplement to these present volumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This collection also includes approximately 200 documents obtained
and processed by the British prosecuting staff, known as
the British War Crimes Executive, and presented in substantiation
of Count II of the Indictment, which the British delegation
assumed the responsibility of proving. It seems altogether fitting
that these documents should be included in these volumes since,
in proving illegal acts of aggression, they naturally supplement
the American documents proving the illegal conspiracy to commit
aggression. The American prosecuting staff is grateful to Sir
David Maxwell-Fyfe, the British Deputy Chief Prosecutor, from
whom and from the goodly company of whose associates there has
ever been the most generous cooperation, for consent to the publication
of the British documents by the United States Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the division of the case agreed on by the Chief Prosecutors
of the four Allied nations, the French and Soviet delegates
are responsible for the presentation of evidence bearing on the
proof of Count III (War Crimes) and Count IV (Crimes against
Humanity) of the Indictment. The French case will concern itself
with these crimes when committed in the West, while the
Russian evidence will concern the commission of these crimes in
the East. None of the documents obtained by these two prosecuting
nations are included in these volumes. The reason is that,
at this writing, the French case has just commenced and the
Soviet case will not be reached for several weeks. Since one of
<span class='pageno' title='x' id='Page_x'></span>
the objects of this undertaking is to acquaint the American public
at the earliest opportunity with the character of the evidence
produced by its representatives, there seems no justification in
delaying publication until the close of the French and Russian
cases, when all the prosecution documents will be available. As
is indicated by the title of these present volumes, <span class='it'>Nazi Conspiracy
and Aggression</span>, this collection relates only to Counts I and II
of the Indictment, or one-half of the prosecution case. It is to be
hoped, however, that supplementary volumes containing the
French and Soviet documents may be published at a later time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, this collection, by its nature limited to a part of the
prosecution case, does not of course purport to present the whole
story of the evidence adduced at Nurnberg. The evidence and
arguments of defense counsel will not be presented for some time,
and the text of these matters will, if possible, be included in any
additional volumes, which it may become possible to publish.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, it may be useful to indicate what this collection
is. The publication is offered in accordance with the conviction
which has constantly animated the American prosecution,
that only a part of its duty would have been done if it succeeded in
persuading the judges of the International Military Tribunal. Its
full task will be accomplished only if the world is also convinced
of the justness of the cause. There were always some people
who, perhaps under the spell of the exposure of the “atrocity
propaganda” used in the First World War, felt that the deceptions
and the outrages laid to the Nazis were quite possibly untrue and
in any event exaggerated. The mission of convincing these skeptics
is one that has not been and cannot be discharged by newspaper
reports of the Nurnberg proceedings, which by their nature
are incomplete and evanescent. But an inspection of the
Nazis’ own official records should suffice to banish all honest
doubts, and to make it undeniably clear that those things really
happened because the Nazis planned it that way. It is the hope
of the American prosecution that these volumes may in some
measure expose, for the warning of future generations as well
as a reminder to the present, the anatomy of National Socialism
in all its ugly nakedness. Many of these documents disclose the
repressive governmental machinery and intricate Party bureaucracy
by which the Nazis stifled initiative and opposition. They
reveal also the image of horror which a gang of brigands created
in the name of the German state, in order to seize and maintain
power for themselves at the expense of the liberties of their own
<span class='pageno' title='xi' id='Page_xi'></span>
people and the lives of their neighbors. Legal proof has perhaps
seldom been so overwhelming, certainly never so self-admitted,
as is this proof of the deeds with which the Nazi leadership befouled
the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, although these documents naturally are concerned primarily
with the guilt of the leaders of the German Reich, they
also contain a wealth of information, much of it hitherto unavailable
elsewhere, on many other matters of importance. Their
pages illuminate many dark corners of recent history. Hence,
this collection has an additional purpose. It is offered as a source
book, of interest to historians, political scientists, students, universities,
libraries, government agencies, private research groups,
newspaper editors, and others, so that they may see, from the
official papers of the Nazi government and from the words of
its own leaders, the things that went on in Germany in the days
of that blasphemous regime. These papers, although they include
a few legal matters, are not addressed nor are they expected to
appeal primarily to lawyers. The satisfaction of these professional
interests must perforce be postponed until publication of
the official record of the trial.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p class='pindent'>It is apparent that such a vast collection of documents on a
variety of subjects would be useless to any one not thoroughly
conversant with the field, without some sort of guide through
the maze. That is the reason for the first two volumes, which
consist of various explanatory materials included in order to facilitate
understanding. The average reader who tries to cope
with some of the more pompous of the Nazi titles—such as
<span class='it'>Beauftragter des Fuehrers fuer die ueberwachung des Gesamten
Geistigen und Weltausschaulichers Schulung und Erziehung der
NSDAP</span>, or Delegate of the Fuehrer for the Total Supervision
of Intellectual and Ideological Training and Education of the
Party (Rosenberg)—is plainly in need of assistance. A Glossary
of common German and Nazi titles, designations, and terms has
therefore been compiled. For those who are unfamiliar with the
difference between a <span class='it'>Hauptmann</span> and a <span class='it'>Hauptsturmfuehrer</span>, a
table of military ranks, with their American equivalents, has
been prepared. A brief biographical gazeteer of the more prominent
Nazis, together with a listing of the major officials of the
Government, Party, and Armed Forces, has also been included
for reference purposes. In addition, an index of the Code-Words
used by the Nazis to preserve the secrecy of the invasions they
plotted has been compiled. Moreover, in order to make clear
<span class='pageno' title='xii' id='Page_xii'></span>
developments in the proceedings affecting the status of several
of the defendants, certain motions of counsel and rulings of the
Tribunal, together with factual accounts, are also presented.
And finally the international treaties relating to land warfare
and prisoners of war are printed in full (<span class='it'>3737-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3738-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The principal content of Volumes I and II is composed of what
might be called essays, summarizing and connecting up most of
the documents relating to particular subjects in the order of their
mention in Counts I and II of the Indictment. As an additional
aid, at the end of each essay there appears a descriptive list of all
documents referred to in the essay, so that the reader may quickly
discover which of the published documents bear upon the subject
in which he is interested. In many cases these lists include documents
not discussed in the essays for the reason that they are
cumulative in nature or were discovered subsequent to the preparation
of the essays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of these essays are adaptations of factual “trial briefs”
prepared by the staff of OCC. Some of these “trial briefs” were
handed to the Tribunal for its assistance, while others were used
only for the guidance of trial counsel. Others of the essays have
been adapted from the oral presentation and summary of counsel
in court. Their difference in origin explains their difference in
form. It must be borne in mind that each of these essays, which
were originally prepared for the purpose of convincing the Tribunal
of the legal guilt of the defendants, has been submitted to
a process of editing and revision in order to serve a quite different
purpose—to give the general reader a general and coherent conception
of the subject matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These essays bear the marks of haste and are not offered as in
any sense definitive or exhaustive. The task of translation from
German into English was a formidable one, and in many instances
translations of documents could be made available to the brief-writers
only a few days before the briefs were scheduled to be
presented in court. In other instances it was utterly impossible,
with the constantly overburdened translating staff available, to
translate in full all the material known to be of value if the prosecution
was to be ready on the date set for trial. The diary of
Hans Frank, for example (<span class='it'>2233-PS</span>) consisted of 42 volumes, of
which only a few outstanding excerpts, chosen by German-reading
analysts, were translated. Similarly, large portions of the
250 volumes of the Rosenberg correspondence remain still untranslated
and unused. Books, decrees, and lengthy reports were
not translated, in full, and only salient excerpts were utilized.
Approximately 1,500 documents in the possession of OCC have not
<span class='pageno' title='xiii' id='Page_xiii'></span>
yet been translated and more are being received daily. It is expected
that they will be used for purposes of cross-examination
and rebuttal, and may later be published.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must also be remembered that these documents are, in the
main, translations from the original German. The magnitude of
the task, coupled with a sense of the hastening on of time, naturally
resulted in imperfections. However, an attempt has been
made to preserve the format of the original documents in the
printed translations. Italics represent underlining in the original
documents and editorial additions have been enclosed in brackets.
The reader may notice occasional variations between the English
wording of documents quoted in the essays, and the full text of
the document itself. This divergence is explained by the fact that
translations of the same documents were sometimes made by
two different persons. Variations in the exact means of expression
were of course to be expected in such an event, yet both
translations are of equal authenticity. Certain passages of some
documents may strike the reader as confused or incomplete, and
occasionally this is the result of hasty work. More frequently,
however the jumble of language accurately reflects the chaos of
the original German, for the language of National Socialists was
often merely a turgid and mystical aggregation of words signifying
nothing, to which the German language easily lends itself.
The accuracy of the translations is attested to in Maj. Coogan’s
affidavit (<span class='it'>001-A-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the case had not been set down for trial until 1948, a complete
and satisfactory preparation would have been possible. A
perfect case could not have been made in less time. But the Allied
governments and public opinion were understandably impatient of
delay for whatever reason, and they had to be respected. The
nature of the difficulties caused by the pressure for speed were
stated in Justice Jackson’s address opening the American case:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“In justice to the nations and the men associated in this
prosecution, I must remind you of certain difficulties which
may leave their mark on this case. Never before in legal history
has an effort been made to bring within the scope of a
single litigation the developments of a decade, covering a
whole Continent, and involving a score of nations, countless
individuals, and innumerable events. Despite the magnitude
of the task, the world has demanded immediate action. This
demand has had to be met, though perhaps at the cost of
finished craftsmanship. In my country, established courts,
following familiar procedures, applying well thumbed precedents,
and dealing with the legal consequences of local and
<span class='pageno' title='xiv' id='Page_xiv'></span>
limited events, seldom commence a trial within a year of the
event in litigation. Yet less than eight months ago today the
courtroom in which you sit was an enemy fortress in the
hands of German SS troops. Less than eight months ago
nearly all our witnesses and documents were in enemy hands.
The law had not been codified, no procedures had been established,
no Tribunal was in existence, no usable courthouse
stood here, none of the hundreds of tons of official German
documents had been examined, no prosecuting staff had been
assembled, nearly all the present defendants were at large,
and the four prosecuting powers had not yet joined in common
cause to try them. I should be the last to deny that the
case may well suffer from incomplete researches and quite
likely will not be the example of professional work which any
of the prosecuting nations would normally wish to sponsor.
It is, however, a completely adequate case to the judgment
we shall ask you to render, and its full development we shall
be obliged to leave to historians.”</p>

</div>

<h4>V</h4>

<p class='pindent'>No work in a specialized field would be complete without its
own occult paraphernalia, and the curious reader may desire an
explanation of the strange wizardry behind the document classification
symbols. The documents in the American series are classified
under the cryptic categories of “<span class='it'>L</span>,” “<span class='it'>R</span>,” “<span class='it'>PS</span>,” “<span class='it'>EC</span>,”
“<span class='it'>ECH</span>,” “<span class='it'>ECR</span>,” and “<span class='it'>C</span>.” The letter “<span class='it'>L</span>” was used as an abbreviation
for “London,” and designates those documents either obtained
from American and British sources in London or processed
in the London Office of the OCC, under the direction of Col.
Murray C. Bernays and Col. Leonard Wheeler, Jr. The letter “<span class='it'>R</span>”
stands for “Rothschild,” and indicates the documents obtained
through the screening activities of Lt. Walter Rothschild of the
London branch of OSS. The origins of the “<span class='it'>PS</span>” symbol are more
mysterious, but the letters are an abbreviation of the amalgam,
“Paris-Storey.” The “<span class='it'>PS</span>” symbol, accordingly, denotes those
documents which, although obtained in Germany, were processed
by Col. Storey’s division of the OCC in Paris, as well as those
documents later processed by the same division after headquarters
were established in Nurnberg. The “<span class='it'>EC</span>” symbol stands for
“Economic Case” and designates those documents which were
obtained and processed by the Economic Section of OCC under
Mr. Francis M. Shea, with field headquarters at Frankfurt. The
“<span class='it'>ECH</span>” variant denotes those which were screened at Heidelberg.
The letter “<span class='it'>C</span>,” which is an abbreviation for “Crimes,” indicates
<span class='pageno' title='xv' id='Page_xv'></span>
a collection of German Navy documents which were jointly processed
by British and American teams, with Lt. Comdr. John
Bracken representing the OCC.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The British documents hence include some in the joint Anglo-American
“<span class='it'>C</span>” series. The remainder of the British documents
are marked with the symbols “<span class='it'>TC</span>,” “<span class='it'>UK</span>,” “<span class='it'>D</span>,” and “<span class='it'>M</span>.” The
symbol “<span class='it'>TC</span>” is an abbreviation of “Treaty Committee” and signifies
the documents selected by a Foreign Office Committee
which assisted the British prosecution. “<span class='it'>UK</span>” is the abbreviation
for “United Kingdom” and indicates documents collected from
another source. No especial significance lurks in the letters
“<span class='it'>D</span>” and “<span class='it'>M</span>,” which were apparently the result of accident,
possibly caprice, rather than design. As a matter of record,
however, “<span class='it'>M</span>” stands for the first name of the British assistant
prosecutor. Finally, “<span class='it'>D</span>” is merely an humble filing reference,
which may have had some obscure connection with the word
“document.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reader will note that there are numerous and often lengthy
gaps in the numbering of documents within a given series,
and the documents are not numbered in any apparent order. This
anomaly is accounted for by several different factors. As the
documents avalanched into the OCC offices they were catalogued
and numbered in the order received without examination. Upon
subsequent analysis it was frequently found that an earlier document
was superseded in quality by a later acquisition, and the
earlier one was accordingly omitted. Others were withdrawn
because of lack of proof of their authenticity. Occasionally it
was discovered that two copies of the same document had been
received from different sources, and one of them was accordingly
stricken from the list. In other cases blocks of numbers were
assigned to field collecting teams, which failed to exhaust all the
numbers allotted. In all these cases no change was made in the
original numbers because of the delay and confusion which would
accompany renumbering. Nor has renumbering been attempted
in this publication, and the original gaps remain. This is because
the documents introduced into evidence carried their originally
assigned numbers, and students of the trial who use these
volumes in conjunction with the official record will therefore be
able to refer rapidly from citations in the record of the proceedings
to the text of the documents cited.</p>

<h3>I. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 1.</span> In pursuance of the Agreement signed on the 8th day
of August 1945 by the Government of the United States of America,
the Provisional Government of the French Republic, the Government
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
there shall be established an International Military Tribunal
(hereinafter called “the Tribunal”) for the just and prompt
trial and punishment of the major war criminals of the European
Axis.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 2.</span> The Tribunal shall consist of four members, each with
an alternate. One member and one alternate shall be appointed
by each of the Signatories. The alternates shall, so far as they
are able, be present at all sessions of the Tribunal. In case of illness
of any member of the Tribunal or his incapacity for some
other reason to fulfill his functions, his alternate shall take his
place.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 3.</span> Neither the Tribunal, its members nor their alternates
can be challenged by the prosecution, or by the Defendants or
their Counsel. Each Signatory may replace its member of the
Tribunal or his alternate for reasons of health or for other good
reasons, except that no replacement may take place during a Trial,
other than by an alternate.</p>

agree among themselves upon the selection from their
number of a President, and the President shall hold office
during that trial, or as may otherwise be agreed by a vote
of not less than three members. The principle of rotation
of presidency for successive trials is agreed. If, however,
a session of the Tribunal takes place on the territory of one
of the four Signatories, the representative of that Signatory
on the Tribunal shall preside.</p>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>c</span>)</span><p class='listPara'>Save as aforesaid the Tribunal shall take decisions by a
majority vote and in case the votes are evenly divided, the

that convictions and sentences shall only be imposed by
affirmative votes of at least three members of the Tribunal.</p>

functions, and procedure of each Tribunal shall be
identical, and shall be governed by this Charter.</p>

<h3>II. JURISDICTION AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 6.</span> The Tribunal established by the Agreement referred
to in Article 1 hereof for the trial and punishment of the major
war criminals of the European Axis countries shall have the power
to try and punish persons who, acting in the interests of the European
Axis countries, whether as individuals or as members of
organizations, committed any of the following crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following acts, or any of them, are crimes coming within
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for which there shall be individual
responsibility:</p>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>a</span>)</span><p class='listPara'>CRIMES AGAINST PEACE: namely, planning, preparation,
initiation, or waging of war of aggression, or a war

the accomplishment of any of the foregoing;</p>

not in violation of domestic law of the country where perpetrated.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices participating
in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy
to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts
performed by any persons in execution of such plan.
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 7.</span> The official position of defendants, whether as Heads
of State or responsible officials in Government Departments, shall
not be considered as freeing them from responsibility or mitigating
punishment.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 8.</span> The fact that the Defendant acted pursuant to order
of his Government or of a superior shall not free him from responsibility,
but may be considered in mitigation of punishment
if the Tribunal determine that justice so requires.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 9.</span> At the trial of any individual member of any group or
organization the Tribunal may declare (in connection with any
act of which the individual may be convicted) that the group or
organization of which the individual was a member was a criminal
organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After receipt of the Indictment the Tribunal shall give such
notice as it thinks fit that the prosecution intends to ask the Tribunal
to make such declaration and any member of the organization
will be entitled to apply to the Tribunal for leave to be heard
by the Tribunal upon the question of the criminal character of the
organization. The Tribunal shall have power to allow or reject
the application. If the application is allowed, the Tribunal may
direct in what manner the applicants shall be represented and
heard.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 10.</span> In cases where a group or organization is declared
criminal by the Tribunal, the competent national authority of any
Signatory shall have the right to bring individuals to trial for
membership therein before national, military or occupation courts.
In any such case the criminal nature of the group or organization
is considered proved and shall not be questioned.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 11.</span> Any person convicted by the Tribunal may be charged
before a national, military or occupation court, referred to in Article
10 of this Charter, with a crime other than of membership
in a criminal group or organization and such court may, after convicting
him, impose upon him punishment independent of and
additional to the punishment imposed by the Tribunal for participation
in the criminal activities of such group or organization.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 12.</span> The Tribunal shall have the right to take proceedings
against a person charged with crimes set out in Article 6 of this
Charter in his absence, if he has not been found or if the Tribunal,
for any reason, finds it necessary, in the interests of justice, to
conduct the hearing in his absence.
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 13.</span> The Tribunal shall draw up rules for its procedure.
These rules shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this
Charter.</p>

<h3>III. COMMITTEE FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND,<br/> PROSECUTION OF MAJOR WAR CRIMINALS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 14.</span> Each Signatory shall appoint a Chief Prosecutor for
the investigation of the charges against and the prosecution of
major war criminals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chief Prosecutors shall act as a committee for the following
purposes:</p>

<div class='listEntry'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Committee shall act in all the above matters by a majority
vote and shall appoint a Chairman as may be convenient and in
accordance with the principle of rotation: provided that if there
is an equal division of vote concerning the designation of a Defendant
to be tried by the Tribunal, or the crimes with which he
shall be charged, that proposal will be adopted which was made
by the party which proposed that the particular Defendant be
tried, or the particular charges be preferred against him.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Article 15.</span> The Chief Prosecutors shall individually, and acting
in collaboration with one another, also undertake the following
duties:</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'>(Charter, Article 6, especially 6 (<span class='it'>a</span>))</p>

<h4>III. Statement of the Offense</h4>

<p class='pindent'>All the defendants, with divers other persons, during a period
of years preceding 8th May, 1945, participated as leaders, organizers,
instigators or accomplices in the formulation or execution
of a common plan or conspiracy to commit, or which involved the
commission of, Crimes against Peace, War Crimes, and Crimes
against Humanity, as defined in the Charter of this Tribunal, and,
in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, are individually
responsible for their own acts and for all acts committed by any
persons in the execution of such plan or conspiracy. The common
plan or conspiracy embraced the commission of Crimes
against Peace, in that the defendants planned, prepared, initiated
and waged wars of aggression, which were also wars in violation
of international treaties, agreements or assurances. In the development
and course of the common plan or conspiracy it came
to embrace the commission of War Crimes, in that it contemplated,
and the defendants determined upon and carried out,
ruthless wars against countries and populations, in violation of
the rules and customs of war, including as typical and systematic
means by which the wars were prosecuted, murder, ill-treatment,
deportation for slave labor and for other purposes of civilian
populations of occupied territories, murder and ill-treatment of
prisoners of war and of persons on the high seas, the taking and
killing of hostages, the plunder of public and-private property,
the wanton destruction of cities, towns, and villages, and devastation
not justified by military necessity. The common plan or
conspiracy contemplated and came to embrace as typical and
systematic means, and the defendants determined upon and committed,
Crimes against Humanity, both within Germany and
within occupied territories, including murder, extermination, enslavement,
deportation, and other inhumane acts committed
against civilian populations before and during the war, and persecutions
on political, racial or religious grounds, in execution of
the plan for preparing and prosecuting aggressive or illegal wars,
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
many of such acts and persecutions being violations of the domestic
laws of the countries where perpetrated.</p>

<h4>IV. Particulars of the nature and development of the common plan or conspiracy</h4>

<h4>(<span class='it'>A</span>) <span class='sc'>Nazi Party as the central core of the common plan or conspiracy</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>In 1921 Adolf Hitler became the supreme leader or Fuehrer of
the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist
German Workers Party), also known as the Nazi Party,
which had been founded in Germany in 1920. He continued as
such throughout the period covered by this Indictment. The
Nazi Party, together with certain of its subsidiary organizations,
became the instrument of cohesion among the defendants and
their co-conspirators and an instrument for the carrying out of
the aims and purposes of their conspiracy. Each defendant became
a member of the Nazi Party and of the conspiracy, with
knowledge of their aims and purposes, or, with such knowledge,
became an accessory to their aims and purposes at some stage
of the development of the conspiracy.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>B</span>) <span class='sc'>Common objectives and methods of conspiracy</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>The aims and purposes of the Nazi Party and of the defendants
and divers other persons from time to time associated as
leaders, members, supporters or adherents of the Nazi Party
(hereinafter called collectively the “Nazi conspirators”) were,
or came to be, to accomplish the following by any means deemed
opportune, including unlawful means, and contemplating ultimate
resort to threat of force, force and aggressive war: (i) to abrogate
and overthrow the Treaty of Versailles and its restrictions
upon the military armament and activity of Germany; (ii) to
acquire the territories lost by Germany as the result of the World
War of 1914-1918 and other territories in Europe asserted by
the Nazi conspirators to be occupied principally by so-called
“racial Germans”; (iii) to acquire still further territories in
continental Europe and elsewhere claimed by the Nazi conspirators
to be required by the “racial Germans” as “Lebensraum,”
or living space, all at the expense of neighboring and other countries.
The aims and purposes of the Nazi conspirators were not
fixed or static but evolved and expanded as they acquired progressively
greater power and became able to make more effective
application of threats of force and threats of aggressive war.
When their expanding aims and purposes became finally so great
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
as to provoke such strength of resistance as could be overthrown
only by armed force and aggressive war, and not simply by the
opportunistic methods theretofore used, such as fraud, deceit,
threats, intimidation, fifth column activities and propaganda, the
Nazi conspirators deliberately planned, determined upon and
launched their aggressive wars and wars in violation of international
treaties, agreements and assurances by the phases and
steps hereinafter more particularly described.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>C</span>) <span class='sc'>Doctrinal techniques of the common plan or conspiracy</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>To incite others to join in the common plan or conspiracy, and
as a means of securing for the Nazi conspirators the highest
degree of control over the German community, they put forth,
disseminated, and exploited certain doctrines, among others, as
follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. That persons of so-called “German blood” (as specified by
the Nazi conspirators) were a “master race” and were accordingly
entitled to subjugate, dominate or exterminate other
“races” and peoples;</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. That the German people should be ruled under the Fuehrerprinzip
(leadership principle) according to which power was to
reside in a Fuehrer from whom sub-leaders were to derive authority
in a hierarchical order, each sub-leader to owe unconditional
obedience to his immediate superior but to be absolute in
his own sphere of jurisdiction; and the power of the leadership
was to be unlimited, extending to all phases of public and private
life;</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. That war was a noble and necessary activity of Germans;</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. That the leadership of the Nazi Party, as the sole bearer

<p class='pindent'>In order to accomplish their aims and purposes, the Nazi conspirators
prepared to seize totalitarian control over Germany to
assure that no effective resistance against them could arise within
Germany itself. After the failure of the Munich Putsch of
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
1923 aimed at the overthrow of the Weimar Republic by direct
action, the Nazi conspirators set out through the Nazi Party to
undermine and capture the German Government by “legal”
forms supported by terrorism. They created and utilized, as a
Party formation, Die Sturmabteilungen (SA), a semi-military,
voluntary organization of young men trained for and committed
to the use of violence, whose mission was to make the Party the
master of the streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. <span class='it'>Control acquired</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 30th January, 1933, Hitler became Chancellor of the German
Republic. After the Reichstag fire of 28th February, 1933,
clauses of the Weimar constitution guaranteeing personal liberty,
freedom of speech, of the press, of association and assembly
were suspended. The Nazi conspirators secured the passage by
the Reichstag of a “Law for the Protection of the People and
the Reich” giving Hitler and the members of his then cabinet
plenary powers of legislation. The Nazi conspirators retained
such powers after having changed the members of the cabinet.
The conspirators caused all political parties except the Nazi
Party to be prohibited. They caused the Nazi Party to be established
as a para-governmental organization with extensive and
extraordinary privileges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. <span class='it'>Consolidation of control</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus possessed of the machinery of the German State, the
Nazi conspirators set about the consolidation of their position
of power within Germany, the extermination of potential internal
resistance and the placing of the German nation on a military
footing.</p>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>a</span>)</span><p class='listPara'>The Nazi conspirators reduced the Reichstag to a body
of their own nominees and curtailed the freedom of
popular elections throughout the country. They
transformed the several states, provinces and municipalities,
which had formerly exercised semi-autonomous
powers, into hardly more than administrative
organs of the central government. They united the
offices of the President and the Chancellor in the person
of Hitler; instituted a widespread purge of civil
servants; and severely restricted the independence of
the judiciary and rendered it subservient to Nazi
ends. The conspirators greatly enlarged existing
State and Party organizations; established a network
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
of new State and Party organizations; and “co-ordinated”
State agencies with the Nazi Party and its
branches and affiliates, with the result that German
life was dominated by Nazi doctrine and practice and
progressively mobilized for the accomplishment of
their aims.</p>

<span class='listTag'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>b</span>)</span><p class='listPara'>In order to make their rule secure from attack and to
instil fear in the hearts of the German people, the
Nazi conspirators established and extended a system
of terror against opponents and supposed or suspected
opponents of the regime. They imprisoned such persons
without judicial process, holding them in “protective
custody” and concentration camps, and subjected
them to persecution, degradation, despoilment
enslavement, torture and murder. These concentration
camps were established early in 1933 under the direction
of the defendant GOERING and expanded as a
fixed part of the terroristic policy and method of the
conspirators and used by them for the commission of
the Crimes against Humanity hereinafter alleged.
Among the principal agencies utilized in the perpetration
of these crimes were the SS and the GESTAPO,
which, together with other favored branches or agencies
of the State and Party, were permitted to operate
without restraint of law.</p>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>c</span>)</span><p class='listPara'>The Nazi conspirators conceived that, in addition to
the suppression of distinctively political opposition, it
was necessary to suppress or exterminate certain
other movements or groups which they regarded as
obstacles to their retention of total control in Germany
and to the aggressive aims of the conspiracy
abroad. Accordingly:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right85percent'>

<span class='listTag'>(1)</span><p class='listPara'>The Nazi conspirators destroyed the free trade
unions in Germany by confiscating their funds
and properties, persecuting their leaders, prohibiting
their activities, and supplanting them
by an affiliated Party organization. The leadership
principle was introduced into industrial
relations, the entrepreneur becoming the leader
and the workers becoming his followers. Thus
any potential resistance of the workers was
frustrated and the productive labor capacity of
the German nation was brought under the effective
control of the conspirators.

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>(2)</span><p class='listPara'>The Nazi conspirators, by promoting beliefs
and practices incompatible with Christian
teaching, sought to subvert the influence of the
Churches over the people and in particular
over the youth of Germany. They avowed their
aim to eliminate the Christian Churches in
Germany and sought to substitute therefor
Nazi institutions and Nazi beliefs and pursued
a programme of persecution of priests, clergy
and members of monastic orders whom they
deemed opposed to their purposes and confiscated
church property.</p>

joined in a program of relentless persecution of
the Jews, designed to exterminate them. Annihilation
of the Jews became an official State policy, carried
out both by official action and by incitements to mob
and individual violence. The conspirators openly
avowed their purpose. For example, the defendant
ROSENBERG stated: “Anti-Semitism is the unifying
element of the reconstruction of Germany.” On another
occasion he also stated: “Germany will regard,
the Jewish question as solved only after the very last
Jew has left the greater German living space .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Europe will have its Jewish question solved only after
the very last Jew has left the Continent.” The defendant
LEY declared: “We swear we are not going to
abandon the struggle until the last Jew in Europe has
been exterminated and is actually dead. It is not
enough to isolate the Jewish enemy of mankind—the
Jew has got to be exterminated.” On another occasion
he also declared: “The second German secret weapon
is anti-Semitism because if it is consistently pursued
by Germany, it will become a universal problem
which all nations will be forced to consider.” The defendant
STREICHER declared: “The sun will not
shine on the nations of the earth until the last Jew
is dead.” These avowals and incitements were typical
of the declarations of the Nazi conspirators throughout
the course of their conspiracy. The program of action
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
against the Jews included disfranchisement,
stigmatization, denial of civil rights, subjecting their
persons and property to violence, deportation, enslavement,
enforced labor, starvation, murder and
mass extermination. The extent to which the conspirators
succeeded in their purpose can only be estimated,
but the annihilation was substantially complete in
many localities of Europe. Of the 9,600,000 Jews who
lived in the parts of Europe under Nazi domination, it
is conservatively estimated that 5,700,000 have disappeared,
most of them deliberately put to death by
the Nazi conspirators. Only remnants of the Jewish
population of Europe remain.</p>

will, and to prepare them psychologically for war, the
Nazi conspirators reshaped the educational system
and particularly the education and training of the
German youth. The leadership principle was introduced
into the schools and the Party and affiliated organizations
were given wide supervisory powers over
education. The Nazi conspirators imposed a supervision
of all cultural activities, controlled the dissemination
of information and the expression of opinion
within Germany as well as the movement of intelligence
of all kinds from and into Germany, and created
vast propaganda machines.</p>

and political association as particularized in paragraph (<span class='it'>D</span>) 3 (<span class='it'>c</span>)

<p class='pindent'>2. They used organizations of German business as instruments

<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>3. They directed Germany’s economy towards preparation and
equipment of the military machine. To this end they directed finance,
capital investment, and foreign trade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. The Nazi conspirators, and in particular the industrialists
among them, embarked upon a huge rearmament programme
and set out to produce and develop huge quantities of materials
of war and to create a powerful military potential.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. With the object of carrying through the preparation for war
the Nazi conspirators, set up a series of administrative agencies
and authorities. For example, in 1936 they established for this
purpose the office of the Four Year Plan with the defendant
GOERING as Plenipotentiary, vesting it with overriding control
over Germany’s economy. Furthermore, on 28th August, 1939,
immediately before launching their aggression against Poland,
they appointed the defendant FUNK Plenipotentiary for Economics;
and on 30th August, 1939, they set up the Ministerial
Council for the Defence of the Reich to act as a War Cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the middle of the year 1933 the Nazi conspirators, having
acquired governmental control over Germany, were in a position
to enter upon further and more detailed planning with particular
relationship to foreign policy. Their plan was to rearm and to
re-occupy and fortify the Rhineland, in violation of the Treaty of
Versailles and other treaties, in order to acquire military strength
and political bargaining power to be used against other nations.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. The Nazi conspirators decided that for their purpose the
Treaty of Versailles must definitely be abrogated and specific
plans were made by them and put into operation by 7th March,
1936, all of which opened the way for the major aggressive steps
to follow, as hereinafter set forth. In the execution of this phase

</div>
<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators next entered upon the specific
planning for the acquisition of Austria and Czechoslovakia,
realizing it would be necessary, for military
reasons, first to seize Austria before assaulting
Czechoslovakia. On 21st May, 1935, in a speech to
the Reichstag, Hitler stated that: “Germany neither
intends nor wishes to interfere in the internal affairs
of Austria, to annex Austria or to conclude an Anschluss.”
On 1st May, 1936, within two months after
the reoccupation of the Rhineland, Hitler stated: “The
lie goes forth again that Germany tomorrow or the
day after will fall upon Austria or Czechoslovakia.”
Thereafter, the Nazi conspirators caused a treaty to
be entered into between Austria and Germany on 11th
July, 1936, Article 1 of which stated that “The German
Government recognizes the full sovereignty of the
Federated State of Austria in the spirit of the pronouncements
of the German Fuehrer and Chancellor
of 21st May, 1935.” Meanwhile, plans for aggression
in violation of that treaty were being made. By the
autumn of 1937, all noteworthy opposition within the
Reich had been crushed. Military preparation for the
Austrian action was virtually concluded. An influential
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
group of the Nazi conspirators met with Hitler on
5th November, 1937, to review the situation. It was
reaffirmed that Nazi Germany must have “Lebensraum”
in central Europe. It was recognized that such
conquest would probably meet resistance which would
have to be crushed by force and that their decision
might lead to a general war, but this prospect was
discounted as a risk worth taking. There emerged
from this meeting three possible plans for the conquest
of Austria and Czechoslovakia. Which of the
three was to be used was to depend upon the developments
in the political and military situation in Europe.
It was contemplated that the conquest of Austria and
Czechoslovakia would, through compulsory emigration
of 2,000,000 persons from Czechoslovakia and 1,000,000
persons from Austria, provide additional food to the
Reich for 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 people, strengthen it
militarily by providing shorter and better frontiers,
and make possible the constituting of new armies up
to about twelve divisions. Thus, the aim of the plan
against Austria and Czechoslovakia was conceived of
not as an end to itself but as a preparatory measure
toward the next aggressive steps in the Nazi conspiracy.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler on 8th February, 1938, called Chancellor
Schuschnigg to a conference at Berchtesgaden. At
the meeting of 12th February, 1938, under threat of
invasion, Schuschnigg yielded a promise of amnesty
to imprisoned Nazis and appointment of Nazis to ministerial
posts. He agreed to remain silent until Hitler’s
20th February speech in which Austria’s independence
was to be reaffirmed, but Hitler in his speech,
instead of affirming Austrian independence, declared
himself protector of all Germans. Meanwhile, subversive
activities of Nazis in Austria increased.
Schuschnigg on 9th March, 1938, announced a plebiscite
for the following Sunday on the question of Austrian
independence. On 11th March Hitler sent an
ultimatum, demanding that the plebiscite be called off
or that Germany would invade Austria. Later the
same day a second ultimatum threatened invasion unless
Schuschnigg should resign in three hours.
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
Schuschnigg resigned. The defendant SEYSS-INQUART,
who was appointed Chancellor, immediately
invited Hitler to send German troops into Austria to
“preserve order.” The invasion began on 12th March,
1938. On 13th March, Hitler by proclamation assumed
office as Chief of State of Austria and took
command of its armed forces. By a law of the same

<p class='pindent'>1. Simultaneously with their annexation of Austria
the Nazi conspirators gave false assurances to the
Czechoslovak Government that they would not attack
that country. But within a month they met to plan
specific ways and means of attacking Czechoslovakia,
and to revise, in the light of the acquisition of Austria,
the previous plans for aggression against Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. On 21st April, 1938, the Nazi conspirators met
and prepared to launch an attack on Czechoslovakia
not later than 1st October, 1938. They planned specifically
to create an “incident” to “justify” the attack.
They decided to launch a military attack only
after a period of diplomatic squabbling which, growing
more serious, would lead to the excuse for war, or,
in the alternative, to unleash a lightning attack as a
result of an “incident” of their own creation. Consideration
was given to assassinating the German
Ambassador at Prague to create the requisite incident.
From and after 21st April, 1938, the Nazi conspirators
caused to be prepared detailed and precise
military plans designed to carry out such an attack
at any opportune moment and calculated to overcome
all Czechoslovak, resistance within four days, thus
presenting the world with a fait accompli, and so forestalling
outside resistance. Throughout the months
of May, June, July, August and September, these
plans were made more specific and detailed, and by
3rd September, 1938, it was decided that all troops
were to be ready for action on 28th September, 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Throughout this same period, the Nazi conspirators
were agitating the minorities question in Czechoslovakia,
and particularly in the Sudetenland, leading
to a diplomatic crisis in August and September, 1938.
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
After the Nazi conspirators threatened war, the
United Kingdom and France concluded a pact with
Germany and Italy at Munich on 29th September,
1938, involving the cession of the Sudetenland by
Czechoslovakia to Germany. Czechoslovakia was required
to acquiesce. On 1st October, 1938, German
troops occupied the Sudetenland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. On 15th March, 1939, contrary to the provisions
of the Munich Pact itself, the Nazi conspirators
caused the completion of their plan by seizing and occupying
the major part of Czechoslovakia not ceded

conspirators had obtained much desired resources and
bases and were ready to undertake further aggressions
by means of war. Following assurances to the
world of peaceful intentions, an influential group of
the conspirators met on 23rd May, 1939, to consider
the further implementation of their plan. The situation
was reviewed and it was observed that “the past
six years have been put to good use and all measures
have been taken in correct sequence and in accordance
with our aims”; that the national-political unity of
the Germans had been substantially achieved; and
that further successes could not be achieved without
war and bloodshed. It was decided nevertheless next
to attack Poland at the first suitable opportunity. It
was admitted that the questions concerning Danzig
which they had agitated with Poland were not true
questions, but rather that the question was one of
aggressive expansion for food and “Lebensraum.” It
was recognized that Poland would fight if attacked
and that a repetition of the Nazi success against
Czechoslovakia without war could not be expected.
Accordingly, it was determined that the problem was
to isolate Poland and, if possible, prevent a simultaneous
conflict with the Western Powers. Nevertheless,
it was agreed that England was an enemy to their aspirations,
and that war with England and her ally
France must eventually result, and therefore that in
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
that war every attempt must be made to overwhelm
England with a “Blitzkrieg.” It was thereupon determined
immediately to prepare detailed plans for an
attack on Poland at the first suitable opportunity and
thereafter for an attack on England and France, together
with plans for the simultaneous occupation by
armed force of air bases in the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>

to make demands for the cession of Polish territory.
Upon refusal by Poland to yield, they caused German

in order to facilitate the carrying out of their military operations
against France and the United Kingdom, the Nazi conspirators
made active preparations for an extension of the war in Europe.
In accordance with those plans, they caused the German armed
forces to invade Denmark and Norway on 9th April, 1940; Belgium,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg on 10th May, 1940; Yugoslavia

Italy and Japan, considering it as a condition precedent of
any lasting peace that all nations of the world be given each its
own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with
one another in regard of their efforts in Greater East Asia and
regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose
to establish and maintain a new order of things calculated to promote
the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned.”
The Nazi conspirators conceived that Japanese aggression would
weaken and handicap those nations with whom they were at war,
and those with whom they contemplated war. Accordingly, the
Nazi conspirators exhorted Japan to seek “a new order of things.”
Taking advantage of the wars of aggression then being waged by
the Nazi conspirators, Japan commenced an attack on 7th December,
1941, against the United States of America at Pearl Harbor
and the Philippines, and against the British Commonwealth of
Nations, French Indo-China and the Netherlands in the southwest
Pacific. Germany declared war against the United States on 11th
December, 1941.

<h4>(<span class='it'>G</span>) <span class='sc'>War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity committed in the course of executing the conspiracy for which the conspirators are responsible</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>1. Beginning with the initiation of the aggressive war on 1st
September, 1939, and throughout its extension into wars involving
almost the entire world, the Nazi conspirators carried out
their common plan or conspiracy to wage war in ruthless and complete
disregard and violation of the laws and customs of war. In
the course of executing the common plan or conspiracy there were
committed the War Crimes detailed hereinafter in Count Three
of this Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Beginning with the initiation of their plan to seize and retain
total control of the German State, and thereafter throughout
their utilization of that control for foreign aggression, the Nazi
conspirators carried out their common plan or conspiracy in ruthless
and complete disregard and violation of the laws of humanity.
In the course of executing the common plan or conspiracy
there were committed the Crimes against Humanity detailed hereinafter
in Count Four of this Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. By reason of all the foregoing, the defendants with divers
other persons are guilty of a common plan or conspiracy for the
accomplishment of Crimes against Peace; of a conspiracy to commit
Crimes against Humanity in the course of preparation for

<h2 class='nobreak'>COUNT THREE—WAR CRIMES</h2>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'>(Charter, Article 6, especially 6 (<span class='it'>b</span>)).</p>

<h4>VIII. Statement of the Offense</h4>

<p class='pindent'>All the defendants committed War Crimes between 1st September,
1939, and 8th May, 1945, in Germany and in all those countries
and territories occupied by the German armed forces since
1st September, 1939, and in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Italy,
and on the High Seas.
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>All the defendants, acting in concert with others, formulated
and executed a common plan or conspiracy to commit War Crimes
as defined in Article 6 (<span class='it'>b</span>) of the Charter. This plan involved,
among other things, the practice of “total war” including methods
of combat and of military occupation in direct conflict with the
laws and customs of war, and the commission of crimes perpetrated
on the field of battle during encounters with enemy armies,
and against prisoners of war, and in occupied territories against
the civilian population of such territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The said War Crimes were committed by the defendants and
by other persons for whose acts the defendants are responsible
(under Article 6 of the Charter) as such other persons when
committing the said War Crimes performed their acts in execution
of a common plan and conspiracy to commit the said War
Crimes, in the formulation and execution of which plan and conspiracy
all the defendants participated as leaders, organizers, instigators
and accomplices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These methods and crimes constituted violations of international
conventions, of internal penal laws and of the general principles
of criminal law as derived from the criminal law of all civilized
nations, and were involved in and part of a systematic
course of conduct.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>A</span>) <span class='sc'>Murder and Ill-treatment of Civilian Populations of or in Occupied Territory and on the High Seas</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the period of their occupation of territories overrun
by their armed forces the defendants, for the purpose of systematically
terrorizing the inhabitants, murdered and tortured
civilians, and ill-treated them, and imprisoned them without legal
process.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The murders and ill-treatment were carried out by divers means,
including shooting, hanging, gassing, starvation, gross overcrowding,
systematic under-nutrition, systematic imposition of
labor tasks beyond the strength of those ordered to carry them
out, inadequate provision of surgical and medical services, kickings,
beatings, brutality and torture of all kinds, including the
use of hot irons and pulling out of fingernails and the performance
of experiments by means of operations and otherwise on living
human subjects. In some occupied territories the defendants
interfered with religious services, persecuted members of the
clergy and monastic orders, and expropriated church property.
They conducted deliberate and systematic genocide, viz., the extermination
of racial and national groups, against the civilian
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
populations of certain occupied territories in order to destroy particular
races and classes of people and national, racial or religious
groups, particularly Jews, Poles and Gypsies and others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Civilians were systematically subjected to tortures of all kinds,
with the object of obtaining information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Civilians of occupied countries were subjected systematically to
“protective arrests” whereby they were arrested and imprisoned
without any trial and any of the ordinary protections of the law,
and they were imprisoned under the most unhealthy and inhumane
conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the concentration camps were many prisoners who were classified
“Nacht und Nebel”. These were entirely cut off from the
world and were allowed neither to receive nor to send letters.
They disappeared without trace and no announcement of their
fate was ever made by the German authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such murders and ill-treatment were contrary to International
Conventions, in particular to Article 46 of the Hague Regulations,
1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal
law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations,
the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were
committed, and to Article 6 (<span class='it'>b</span>) of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following particulars and all the particulars appearing later
in this count are set out herein by way of example only, are not
exclusive of other particular cases, and are stated without prejudice
to the right of the Prosecution to adduce evidence of other
cases of murder and ill-treatment of civilians.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='hang'>1. <span class='it'>In France, Belgium, Denmark, Holland, Norway, Luxembourg,
Italy and the Channel Islands (hereinafter called the
“Western Countries”) and in that part of Germany which
lies west of a line drawn due North and South through the
centre of Berlin (hereinafter called “Western Germany”).</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such murder and ill-treatment took place in concentration camps
and similar establishments set up by the defendants and particularly
in the concentration camps set up at Belsen, Buchenwald,
Dachau, Breendonck, Grini, Natzweiler, Ravensbruck, Vught and
Amersfoort, and in numerous cities, towns and villages, including
Oradour sur Glane, Trondheim and Oslo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crimes committed in France or against French citizens took
the following forms:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arbitrary arrests were carried out under political or racial pretexts;
they were both individual and collective; notably in Paris
(round-up of the 18th Arrondissement by the Field Gendarmerie,
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
round-up of the Jewish population of the 11th Arrondissement
in August, 1941, round-up of Jewish intellectuals in December,
1941, round-up in July, 1942); at Clermont-Ferrand, (round-up of
professors and students of the University of Strasbourg, who
were taken to Clermon-Ferrand[Clermont-Ferrand?] on 25th November, 1943); at
Lyons; at Marseilles (round-up of 40,000 persons in January,
1943); at Grenoble (round-up on 24th December, 1943); at Cluny
(round-up on 24th December, 1944); at Figeac (round-up in May,
1944); at Saint Pol de Leon (round-up in July, 1944); at Locminé
(round-up on 3rd July, 1944); at Eyzieux (round-up in May,
1944) and at Moussey (round-up in September, 1944). These arrests
were followed by brutal treatment and tortures carried out
by the most diverse methods, such as immersion in icy water,
asphyxiation, torture of the limbs, and the use of instruments of
torture, such as the iron helmet and electric current, and practised
in all the prisons of France, notably in Paris, Lyons, Marseilles,
Rennes, Metz, Clermont-Ferrand, Toulouse, Nice, Grenoble,
Annecy, Arras, Bethune, Lille, Loos, Valenciennes, Nancy,
Troyes and Caen, and in the torture chambers fitted up at the
Gestapo centres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the concentration camps, the health regime, and the labour
regime, were such that the rate of mortality (alleged to be from
natural causes) attained enormous proportions, for instance:—</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Methods used for the work of extermination in concentration
camps were:—bad treatment, pseudo-scientific experiments (sterilization
of women at Auschwitz and at Ravensbruck, study of
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
the evolution of cancer of the womb at Auschwitz, of typhus at
Buchenwald, anatomical research at Natzweiller, heart injections
at Buchenwald, bone grafting and muscular excisions at Ravensbruck,
etc.), gas-chambers, gas-wagons and crematory ovens. Of
228,000 French political and racial deportees in concentration
camps, only 28,000 survived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France also systematic extermination was practised, notably
at Asq on 1st April, 1944, at Colpo on 22nd July, 1944, at Buzet
sur Tarn on 6th July, 1944 and on 17th August, 1944, at Pluvignier
on 8th July, 1944, at Rennes on 8th June, 1944, at Grenoble
on 8th July, 1944, at Saint Flour on 10th June, 1944, at Ruisnes
on 10th July, 1944, at Nimes, at Tulle, and at Nice, where, in July,
1944, the victims of torture were exposed to the population, and
at Oradour sur Glane where the entire village population was shot
or burned alive in the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The many charnel pits give proof of anonymous massacres.
Most notable of these are the charnel pits of Paris (Cascade du
Bois de Boulogne), Lyons, Saint Genies Laval, Besancon, Petit
Saint Bernard, Aulnat, Caen, Port Louis, Charleval, Fontainebleau,
Bouconne, Gabaudet, L’hermitage, Lorges, Morlaas, Bordelongue,
Signe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of a premeditated campaign of terrorism, initiated
in Denmark by the Germans in the latter part of 1943, 600
Danish subjects were murdered and, in addition, throughout the
German occupation of Denmark, large numbers of Danish subjects
were subjected to torture and ill-treatment of all sorts. In
addition, approximately 500 Danish subjects were murdered, by
torture and otherwise, in German prisons and concentration
camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium between 1940 and 1944 tortures by various means,
but identical in each place, were carried out at Brussels, Liege,
Mons, Ghent, Namur, Antwerp, Tournai, Arlon, Charleroi and
Dinant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Vught, in Holland, when the camp was evacuated about 400
persons were murdered by shooting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Luxembourg, during the German occupation, 500 persons
were murdered and, in addition, another 521 were illegally
executed, by order of such special tribunals as the so-called “Sondergericht”.
Many more persons in Luxembourg were subjected
to torture and mistreatment by the Gestapo. Not less than 4,000
Luxembourg nationals were imprisoned during the period of German
occupation, and of these at least 400 were murdered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between March, 1944, and April, 1945, in Italy, at least 7,500
men, women and children, ranging in years from infancy to extreme
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
old age were murdered by the German soldiery at Civitella,
in the Ardeatine Caves in Rome, and at other places.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='hang'>2. <span class='it'>In the U.S.S.R., i.e., in the Bielorussian, Ukrainian, Esthonian,
Latvian, Lithuanian, Karelo-Finnish, and Moldavian
Soviet Socialist Republics, in 19 regions of the Russian
Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, and in Poland, Czecho-Slovakia,
Yugoslavia, Greece, and the Balkans (hereinafter
called “the Eastern Countries”) and in that part of Germany
which lies East of a line drawn North and South
through the centre of Berlin (hereinafter called “Eastern
Germany”).</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the 1st September, 1939, when the German armed forces
invaded Poland, and from the 22nd June, 1941, when they invaded
the U.S.S.R., the German Government and the German
High Command adopted a systematic policy of murder and ill-treatment
of the civilian populations of and in the Eastern Countries
as they were successively occupied by the German armed
forces. These murders and ill-treatments were carried on continuously
until the German Armed Forces were driven out of the
said countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such murders and ill-treatments included:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) Murders and ill-treatments at concentration camps and
similar establishments set up by the Germans in the Eastern
Countries and in Eastern Germany including those set up at
Maidanek and Auschwitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The said murders and ill-treatments were carried out by divers
means including all those set out above, as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>About 1,500,000 persons were exterminated in Maidanek and
about 4,000,000 persons were exterminated in Auschwitz, among
whom were citizens of Poland, the U.S.S.R., the United States of
America, Great Britain, Czechoslovakia, France and other countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Lwow region and in the city of Lwow the Germans exterminated
about 700,000 Soviet people, including 70 persons in
the field of the arts, science and technology, and also citizens of
the U. S. A., Great Britain, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Holland,
brought to this region from other concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Jewish ghetto from 7th September, 1941, to 6th July,
1943, over 133,000 persons were tortured and shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mass shooting of the population occurred in the suburbs of the
city and in the Livenitz forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Ganov camp 200,000 peaceful citizens were exterminated.
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
The most refined methods of cruelty were employed in this extermination,
such as disembowelling and the freezing of human
beings in tubs of water. Mass shootings took place to the accompaniment
of the music of an orchestra recruited from the
persons interned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beginning with June, 1943, the Germans carried out measures
to hide the evidence of their crimes. They exhumed and
burned corpses, and they crushed the bones with machines and
used them for fertilizer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of 1944 in the Ozarichi region of the Bielorussian
S.S.R., before liberation by the Red Army, the Germans
established three concentration camps without shelters, to which
they committed tens of thousands of persons from the neighbouring
territories. They brought many people to these camps from
typhus hospitals intentionally, for the purpose of infecting the
other persons interned and for spreading the disease in territories
from which the Germans were being driven by the Red
Army. In these camps there were many murders and crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Esthonian S.S.R. they shot tens of thousands of persons
and in one day alone, 19th September, 1944, in Camp Kloga, the
Germans shot 2,000 peaceful citizens. They burned the bodies on
bonfires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Lithuanian S.S.R. there were mass killings of Soviet
citizens, namely: in Panerai at least 100,000; in Kaunas more
than 70,000; in Alitus about 60,000; at Prenai more than 3,000;
in Villiampol about 8,000; in Mariampol about 7,000; in Trakai
and neighbouring towns 37,640.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Latvian S.S.R. 577,000 persons were murdered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of the whole system of internal order maintained in
all camps, the interned persons were doomed to die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a secret instruction entitled “the internal regime in concentration
camps”, signed personally by Himmler in 1941 severe
measures of punishment were set forth for the internees. Masses
of prisoners of war were shot, or died from the cold and torture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) Murders and ill-treatments at places in the Eastern Countries
and in the Soviet Union, other than in the camps referred to
in (<span class='it'>a</span>) above, included, on various dates during the occupation by
the German Armed Forces:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The destruction in the Smolenck region of over 135,000 Soviet
citizens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among these, near the village of Kholmetz of the Sychev region,
when the military authorities were required to remove the
mines from an area, on the order of the Commander of the 101st
German Infantry Division, Major-General Fisler, the German
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
soldiers gathered the inhabitants of the village of Kholmetz and
forced them to remove mines from the road. All of these people
lost their lives as a result of exploding mines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Leningrad region there were shot and tortured over
172,000 persons, including over 20,000 persons who were killed
in the city of Leningrad by the barbarous artillery barrage and
the bombings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Stavropol region in an anti-tank trench close to the station
of Mineralny Vody, and in other cities, tens of thousands of
persons were exterminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Pyatigorsk many were subjected to torture and criminal
treatment, including suspension from the ceiling and other methods.
Many of the victims of these tortures were then shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Krasnodar some 6,700 civilians were murdered by poison
gas in gas vans, or were shot and tortured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Stalingrad region more than 40,000 persons were killed
and tortured. After the Germans were expelled from Stalingrad,
more than a thousand mutilated bodies of local inhabitants were
found with marks of torture. One hundred and thirty-nine women
had their arms painfully bent backward and held by wires. From
some their breasts had been cut off and their ears, fingers and
toes had been amputated. The bodies bore the marks of burns.
On the bodies of the men the five pointed star was burned with an
iron or cut with a knife. Some were disembowelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Orel over 5,000 persons were murdered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Novgorod and in the Novgorod region many thousands of
Soviet citizens were killed by shooting, starvation and torture.
In Minsk tens of thousands of citizens were similarly killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Crimea peaceful citizens were gathered on barges, taken
out to sea and drowned, over 144,000 persons being exterminated
in this manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Soviet Ukraine there were monstrous criminal acts of
the Nazi conspirators. In Babi Yar, near Kiev, they shot over
100,000 men, women, children and old people. In this city in
January, 1941, after the explosion in German Headquarters on
Dzerzhinsky Street the Germans arrested as hostages 1,250 persons—old
men, minors, women with nursing infants. In Kiev
they killed over 195,000 persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Rovno and the Rovno region they killed and tortured over
100,000 peaceful citizens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Dnepropetrovsk, near the Transport Institute, they shot or
threw alive into a great ravine 11,000 women, old men and
children.
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In Kamenetz-Podolsk Region 31,000 Jews were shot and exterminated,
including 13,000 persons brought there from Hungary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Odessa Region at least 200,000 Soviet citizens were
killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Kharkov about 195,000 persons were either tortured to
death, shot or gassed in gas vans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Gomel the Germans rounded up the population in prison,
and tortured and tormented them, and then took them to the centre
of the city and shot them in public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the city of Lyda in the Grodenen region on 8th May, 1942,
5,670 persons were completely undressed, driven into pens in
groups of 100 and then shot by machine guns. Many were thrown
in the graves while they were still alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along with adults the Nazi conspirators mercilessly destroyed
even children. They killed them with their parents, in groups and
alone. They killed them in children’s homes and hospitals, burying
the living in the graves, throwing them into flames, stabbing
them with bayonets, poisoning them, conducting experiments
upon them, extracting their blood for the use of the German
Army, throwing them into prison and Gestapo torture chambers
and concentration camps, where the children died from hunger,
torture and epidemic diseases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 6th September to 24th November, 1942, in the region of
Brest, Pinsk, Kobren, Dyvina, Malority and Berezy-Kartuzsky
about 400 children were shot by German punitive units.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Yanov camp in the city of Lwow the Germans killed
8,000 children in two months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the resort of Tiberda the Germans annihilated 500 children
suffering from tuberculosis of the bone, who were in the sanatorium
for the cure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the territory of the Latvian S.S.R. the German usurpers
killed thousands of children, which they had brought there with
their parents from the Bielorussian S.S.R., and from the Kalinin,
Kaluga and other regions of the R.S.F.S.R.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Czechoslovakia as a result of torture, beating, hanging, and
shootings, there were annihilated in Gestapo prisons in Brno,
Seim and other places over 20,000 persons. Moreover many thousands
of internees were subjected to criminal treatment, beatings
and torture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both before the war, as well as during the war, thousands of
Czech patriots, in particular catholics and protestants, lawyers,
doctors, teachers, etc., were arrested as hostages and imprisoned.
A large number of these hostages were killed by the Germans.

<p class='pindent'>In Greece in October, 1941, the male populations between 16
and 60 years of age of the Greek villages Amelofito, Kliston,
Kizonia Mesovunos, Selli, Ano-Kerzilion and Kato-Kerzilion were
shot—in all 416 persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Yugoslavia many thousands of civilians were murdered.

<h4>(<span class='it'>B</span>) <span class='sc'>Deportation for Slave Labour and for other purposes of the Civilian Populations of and in Occupied Territories</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>During the whole period of the occupation by Germany of both
the Western and the Eastern Countries it was the policy of the
German Government and of the German High Command to deport
able bodied citizens from such occupied countries to Germany
and to other occupied countries for the purpose of slave
labour upon defence works, in factories and in other tasks connected
with the German War effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In pursuance of such policy there were mass deportations from
all the Western and Eastern countries for such purposes during
the whole period of the occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such deportations were contrary to international Conventions,
in particular to Article 46 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the
laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law
as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal
penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed
and to Article 6 (<span class='it'>b</span>) of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Particulars of deportations, by way of example only and without
prejudice to the production of evidence of other cases are as
follows:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. From the Western Countries:</p>

<p class='pindent'>From France the following deportations of persons for political
and racial reasons took place—each of which consisted of
from 1,500-2,500 deportees:</p>

</table>

<p class='pindent'>Such deportees were subjected to the most barbarous conditions
of overcrowding; they were provided with wholly insufficient
clothing and were given little or no food for several days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conditions of transport were such that many deportees
died in the course of the voyage, for example:
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In one of the wagons of the train which left Compiegne for
Buchenwald, on the 17th September, 1943, 80 men died out of
130;</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 4th June, 1944, 484 bodies were taken out of the train at
Sarrebourg;</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a train which left Compiegne on the 2nd July, 1944, for
Dachau, more than 600 dead were found on arrival, i.e., one-third
of the total number;</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a train which left Compiegne on the 16th January, 1944,
for Buchenwald more than 100 men were confined in each wagon,
the dead and the wounded being heaped in the last wagon during
the voyage;</p>

<p class='pindent'>In April, 1945, of 12,000 internees evacuated from Buchenwald,
4,000 only were still alive when the marching column arrived
near Regensburg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the German occupation of Denmark, 5,200 Danish subjects
were deported to Germany and there imprisoned in concentration
camps and other places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1942 and thereafter 6,000 nationals of Luxembourg were
departed from their country under deplorable conditions as a result
of which many of them perished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Belgium between 1940 and 1941 at least 190,000 civilians
were deported to Germany and used as slave labour. Such deportees
were subjected to ill-treatment and many of them were
compelled to work in armament factories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Holland, between 1940 and 1944 nearly half a million
civilians were deported to Germany and to other occupied
countries.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. From the Eastern Countries:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German occupying authorities deported from the Soviet
Union to slavery about 4,978,000 Soviet citizens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>750,000 Czechoslovakian citizens were taken away for forced
labor outside the Czechoslovak frontiers in the interior of the
German war machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On June 4, 1941, in the city of Zagreb (Yugoslavia) a meeting
of German representatives was called with the Councillor Von
Troll presiding. The purpose was to set up the means of deporting
the Yugoslav population from Slovenia. Tens of thousands
of persons were deported in carrying out this plan.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>C</span>) <span class='sc'>Murder and Ill-treatment of Prisoners of War, and of other members of the Armed Forces of the countries with whom Germany was at war, and of persons on the high seas</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendants murdered and ill-treated prisoners of war by
denying them adequate food, shelter, clothing and medical care
and attention; by forcing them to labor in inhumane conditions;
by torturing them and subjecting them to inhuman indignities
and by killing them. The German Government and the German
High Command imprisoned prisoners of war in various concentration
camps, where they were killed and subjected to inhuman
treatment by the various methods set forth in paragraph VIII
(<span class='it'>A</span>). Members of the armed forces of the countries with whom
Germany was at war were frequently murdered while in the act
of surrendering. These murders and ill-treatment were contrary
to International Conventions, particularly Articles 4, 5, 6, and 7
of the Hague Regulations, 1907, and to Articles 2, 3, 4 and 6 of
the Prisoners of War Convention (Geneva 1929) the laws and
customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived
from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal
laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed and to
Article 6 (<span class='it'>b</span>) of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Particulars by way of examples and without prejudice to the
production of evidence of other cases, are as follows:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. In the Western Countries:</p>

<p class='pindent'>French officers who escaped from Oflag X C were handed over
to the Gestapo and disappeared; others were murdered by their
guards; others sent to concentration camps and exterminated.
Among others, the men of Stalag VI C were sent to Buchenwald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frequently prisoners captured on the Western Front were
obliged to march to the camps until they completely collapsed.
Some of them walked more than 600 kilometers with hardly any
food; they marched on for 48 hours running, without being fed;
among them a certain number died of exhaustion or of hunger;
stragglers were systematically murdered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same crimes have been committed in 1943, 1944 and 1945
when the occupants of the camps were withdrawn before the Allied
advance; particularly during the withdrawal of the prisoners
of Sagan on February 8th, 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bodily punishments were inflicted upon non-commissioned officers
and cadets who refused to work. On December 24th, 1943,
three French N.C.O’s were murdered for that motive in Stalag
IV A. Many ill-treatments were inflicted without motive on other
ranks: stabbing with bayonets, striking with rifle-butts and whipping;
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
in Stalag XX B the sick themselves were beaten many
times by sentries; in Stalag III B and Stalag III C, worn-out prisoners
were murdered or grievously wounded. In military gaols in
Graudenz for instance, in reprisal camps as in Rava-Ruska, the
food was so insufficient that the men lost more than 15 kilograms
in a few weeks. In May, 1942, 1 loaf of bread only was distributed
in Rava-Ruska to each group of 35 men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Orders were given to transfer French officers in chains to the
camp of Mauthausen after they had tried to escape. At their arrival
in camp they were murdered, either by shooting, or by gas
and their bodies destroyed in the crematorium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>American prisoners, officers and men, were murdered in Normandy
during the summer of 1944 and in the Ardennes in December,
1944. American prisoners were starved, beaten and otherwise
mistreated in numerous Stalag in Germany and in the occupied
countries, particularly in 1943, 1944 and 1945.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. In the Eastern Countries:</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Orel prisoners of war were exterminated by starvation,
shooting, exposure, and poisoning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soviet prisoners of war were murdered en masse on orders
from the High Command and the Headquarters of the SIPO and
SD. Tens of thousands of Soviet prisoners of war were tortured
and murdered at the “Gross Lazaret” at Slavuta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, many thousands of the persons referred to in
paragraph VIII (A) 2, above, were Soviet prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prisoners of war who escaped and were recaptured were
handed over to SIPO and SD for shooting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frenchmen fighting with the Soviet Army who were captured
were handed over to the Vichy Government for “proceedings”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In March, 1944, 50 R.A.F. officers who escaped from Stalag
Luft III at Sagan, when recaptured, were murdered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In September, 1941, 11,000 Polish officers, who were prisoners
of war were killed in the Katyn Forest near Smolensk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Yugoslavia the German Command and the occupying authorities
in the person of the chief officials of the Police, the SS
troops (Police Lieutenant General Rosener) and the Divisional
Group Command (General Kuebler and others) in the period
1941-43 ordered the shooting of prisoners of war.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>D</span>) <span class='sc'>Killing of Hostages</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the territories occupied by the German armed
forces in the course of waging aggressive wars, the defendants
adopted and put into effect on a wide scale the practice of taking,
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
and of killing, hostages from the civilian population. These acts
were contrary to International Conventions, particularly Article
50 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war,
the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal
laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of the
countries in which such crimes were committed and to Article 6
(<span class='it'>b</span>) of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Particulars by way of example and without prejudice to the
production of evidence of other cases, are as follows:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. In the Western Countries:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France hostages were executed either individually or collectively;
these executions took place in all the big cities of France,
among others in Paris, Bordeaux and Nantes, as well as at Chateabriant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Holland many hundreds of hostages were shot at the following
among other places—Rotterdam, Apeldoorn, Amsterdam, Benschop
and Haarlem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium many hundreds of hostages were shot during the
period 1940 to 1944.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. In the Eastern Countries:</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Kragnevatz in Yugoslavia 2,300 hostages were shot in October,
1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Kralevo in Yugoslavia 5,000 hostages were shot.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>E</span>) <span class='sc'>Plunder of Public and Private Property</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>The defendants ruthlessly exploited the people and the material
resources of the countries they occupied, in order to strengthen
the Nazi war machine, to depopulate and impoverish the rest of
Europe, to enrich themselves and their adherents, and to promote
German economic supremacy over Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendants engaged in the following acts and practices,
among others:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. They degraded the standard of life of the people of occupied
countries and caused starvation, by stripping occupied countries
of foodstuffs for removal to Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. They seized raw materials and industrial machinery in all
of the occupied countries, removed them to Germany and used
them in the interest of the German war effort and the German
economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. In all the occupied countries, in varying degrees, they confiscated
businesses, plants and other property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. In an attempt to give color of legality to illegal acquisitions
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
of property, they forced owners of property to go through the
forms of “voluntary” and “legal” transfers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. They established comprehensive controls over the economies
of all of the occupied countries and directed their resources, their
production and their labor in the interests of the German war
economy, depriving the local populations of the products of essential
industries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>6. By a variety of financial mechanisms, they despoiled all of
the occupied countries of essential commodities and accumulated
wealth, debased the local currency systems and disrupted the
local economies. They financed extensive purchases in occupied
countries through clearing arrangements by which they exacted
loans from the occupied countries. They imposed occupation
levies, exacted financial contributions, and issued occupation currency,
far in excess of occupation costs. They used these excess
funds to finance the purchase of business properties and supplies
in the occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>7. They abrogated the rights of the local populations in the
occupied portions of the USSR and in Poland and in other countries
to develop or manage agricultural and industrial properties,
and reserved this area for exclusive settlement, development, and
ownership by Germans and their so-called racial brethren.</p>

<p class='pindent'>8. In further development of their plan of criminal exploitation,
they destroyed industrial cities, cultural monuments, scientific
institutions, and property of all types in the occupied territories
to eliminate the possibility of competition with Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>9. From their program of terror, slavery, spoliation and organized
outrage, the Nazi conspirators created an instrument for the
personal profit and aggrandizement of themselves and their adherents.
They secured for themselves and their adherents</p>

systematic policy, a continuous course of plunder and destruction
including:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the territory of the Soviet Union the Nazi conspirators destroyed
or severely damaged 1,710 cities and more than 70,000 villages
and hamlets, more than 6,000,000 buildings and made homeless
about 25,000,000 persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the cities which suffered most destruction are Stalingrad,
Sevastopol, Kiev, Minsk, Odessa, Smolensk, Novgorod,
Pskov, Orel, Kharkov, Voronezh, Rostov-on-Don, Stalino and Leningrad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As is evident from an official memorandum of the German command,
the Nazi conspirators planned the complete annihilation of
entire Soviet cities. In completely secret order of the Chief of
the Naval Staff (Staff Ia No. 1601/41, dated 29, IX, 1941), addressed
only to Staff officers, it was said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Fuehrer has decided to erase from the face of the earth
St. Petersburgh. The existence of this large city will have no
further interest after Soviet Russia is destroyed. Finland has
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
also said that the existence of this city on her new border is not
desirable from her point of view. The original request of the
Navy that docks, harbor, etc. necessary for the fleet be preserved—is
known to the Supreme Commander of the Military Forces,
but the basic principles of carrying out operations against St.
Petersburgh do not make it possible to satisfy this request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is proposed to approach near to the city and to destroy it
with the aid of an artillery barrage from weapons of different
calibres and with long air attacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The problem of the life of the population and the provisioning
of them is a problem which cannot and must not be decided by us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this war * * * we are not interested in preserving even
a part of the population of this large city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans destroyed 427 museums, among them the wealthy
museums of Leningrad, Smolensk, Stalingrad, Novgorod, Poltava
and others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Pyatigorsk the art objects brought there from the Rostov
museum were seized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The losses suffered by the coal mining industry alone in the
Stalin Region amount to 2,000,000,000 rubles. There was colossal
destruction of industrial establishments in Makerevka, Carlovka,
Yenakievo, Konstantinovka, Mariupol, from which most of the
machinery and factories were removed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stealing of huge dimensions and the destruction of industrial,
cultural and other property was typified in Kiev. More than
4,000,000 books, magazines and manuscripts (many of which were
very valuable and even unique) and a large number of artistic
productions and valuables of different kinds were stolen and carried
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many valuable art productions were taken away from Riga.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The extent of the plunder of cultural valuables is evidenced by
the fact that 100,000 valuable volumes and 70 cases of ancient
periodicals and precious monographs were carried away by Rosenberg’s
staff alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among further examples of these crimes are:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wanton devastation of the city of Novgorod and of many historical
and artistic monuments there. Wanton devastation and
plunder of the city of Rovno and of its province. The destruction
of the industrial, cultural and other property in Odessa. The
destruction of cities and villages in Soviet Karelia. The destruction
in Estonia of cultural, industrial and other buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The destruction of medical and prophylactic institutes, the
destruction of agriculture and industry in Lithuania, the destruction
of cities in Latvia.
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans approached monuments of culture, dear to the
Soviet people, with special hatred. They broke up the estate of
the poet Pushkin in Mikhailovskoye, desecrating his grave, and
destroying the neighboring villages and the Svyatogor monastery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They destroyed the estate and museum of Lev Tolstoy, “Yasnaya
Polyana” and desecrated the grave of the great writer. They
destroyed in Klin the museum of Tsaikovsky and in Penaty, the
museum of the painter Repin and many others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators destroyed 1,670 Greek Orthodox
Churches, 237 Roman Catholic Churches, 67 Chapels, 532 Synagogues,
etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They broke up, desecrated and senselessly destroyed also the
most valuable monuments of the Christian Church, such as Kievo-Pecherskaya
Lavra, Novy Jerusalem in the Istrin region, and the
most ancient monasteries and churches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Destruction in Esthonia of cultural industrial and other premises:
burning down of many thousands of residential buildings:
removal of 10,000 works of art: destruction of medical and prophylactic
institutions. Plunder and removal to Germany of immense
quantities of agricultural stock including horses, cows,
pigs, poultry, beehives and agricultural machines of all kinds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Destruction of agriculture, enslavement of peasants and looting
of stock and produce in Lithuania.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Latvian Republic destruction of the agriculture by the
looting of all stock, machinery and produce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of this policy of plunder and destruction was to lay
waste the land and cause utter desolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The overall value of the material loss which the U.S.S.R. has
borne, is computed to be 679,000,000,000 rubles, in state prices
of 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia on 15
March 1939 the defendants seized and stole large stocks of raw
materials, copper, tin, iron, cotton, and food; caused to be taken
to Germany large amounts of railway rolling stock, and many engines,
carriages, steam vessels and trolley buses; plundered libraries,
laboratories, and art museums of books, pictures, objects
of art, scientific apparatus and furniture; stole all gold reserves
and foreign exchange of Czechoslovakia, including 23,000 kilograms
of gold of a nominal value of £5,265,000; fraudulently acquired
control and thereafter looted the Czech banks and many
Czech industrial enterprises; and otherwise stole, looted and misappropriated
Czechoslovak public and private property. The total
sum of defendants’ economic spoliation of Czechoslovakia from
1938 to 1945 is estimated at 200,000,000,000 Czechoslovak crowns.
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span></p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>F</span>) <span class='sc'>The exaction of Collective Penalties</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans pursued a systematic policy of inflicting, in all
the occupied countries, collective penalties, pecuniary and otherwise,
upon the population for acts of individuals for which it could
not be regarded as collectively responsible; this was done at many
places, including Oslo, Stavanger, Trondheim and Rogaland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similar instances occurred in France, among others in Dijon,
Nantes and as regards the Jewish population in the occupied territories.
The total amount of fines imposed on French communities
add up to 1,157,179,484 francs made up as follows—</p>

<p class='pindent'>These acts violated Article 50, Hague Regulations, 1907, the
laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law
as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal
penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were
committed and Article 6 (<span class='it'>b</span>) of the Charter.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>G</span>) <span class='sc'>Wanton Destruction of Cities, Towns and Villages and Devastation Not Justified by Military Necessity</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendants wantonly destroyed cities, towns and villages
and committed other acts of devastation without military justification
or necessity. These acts violated Articles 46 and 50 of the
Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general
principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws
of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of the countries
in which such crimes were committed and Article 6 (<span class='it'>b</span>) of the
Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Particulars by way of example only and without prejudice to
the production of evidence of other cases are as follows:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. Western Countries:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In March, 1941, part of Lofoten in Norway was destroyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In April, 1942, the town of Telerag in Norway was destroyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entire villages were destroyed in France, among others Oradour-sur-Glane,
Saint-Nizier and, in the Vercors, La Mure, Vassieux,
La Chapelle en Vercors. The town of Saint Dié was burnt
down and destroyed. The Old Port District of Marseilles was
dynamited in the beginning of 1943 and resorts along the Atlantic
and the Mediterranean coasts, particularly the town of
Sanary, were demolished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Holland there was most widespread and extensive destruction,
not justified by military necessity, including the destruction
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
of harbours, locks, dykes and bridges: immense devastation
was also caused by inundations which equally were not justified
by military necessity.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Eastern Countries:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Eastern Countries the Defendants pursued a policy of
wanton destruction and devastation: some particulars of this
(without prejudice to the production of evidence of other cases)
are set out above under the heading—“Plunder of Public and
Private Property”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Greece in 1941, the villages of Amelofito, Kliston, Kizonia,
Messovunos, Selli, Ano-Kerzilion and Kato-Kerzilion were utterly
destroyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Yugoslavia on 15 August, 1941, the German military command
officially announced that the village of Skela was burned to
the ground and the inhabitants killed on the order of the command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the order of the Field Commander Hoersterberg a punitive
expedition from the SS troops and the field police destroyed the
villages of Machkovats, and Kriva Reka in Serbia and all the inhabitants
were killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Fritz Neidhold (369 Infantry Division) on 11 September,
1944, gave an order to destroy the villages of Zagniezde and
Udora, hanging all the men and driving away all the women and
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Czechoslovakia the Nazi conspirators also practised the senseless
destruction of populated places. Lezaky and Lidice were
burned to the ground and the inhabitants killed.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>H</span>) <span class='sc'>Conscription of Civilian Labour</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the occupied territories the defendants conscripted
and forced the inhabitants to labour and requisitioned their services
for purposes other than meeting the needs of the armies of
occupation and to an extent far out of proportion to the resources
of the countries involved. All the civilians so conscripted were
forced to work for the German war effort. Civilians were required
to register and many of those who registered were forced
to join the Todt Organization and the Speer Legion, both of which
were semi-military organizations involving some military training.
These acts violated Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Regulations,
1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of
criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations,
the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes
were committed and Article 6 (<span class='it'>b</span>) of the Charter.
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Particulars, by way of example only and without prejudice to
the production of evidence of other cases, are as follows:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. Western Countries:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France, from 1942 to 1944, 963,813 persons were compelled
to work in Germany and 737,000 to work in France for the German
Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Luxembourg in 1944 alone, 2,500 men and 500 girls were
conscripted for forced labor.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Eastern Countries:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the large number of citizens of the Soviet Union and of
Czechoslovakia referred to under Count Three VIII (<span class='it'>B</span>) 2 above
many were so conscripted for forced labor.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>I</span>) <span class='sc'>Forcing Civilians of Occupied Territories to Swear Allegiance to a Hostile Power</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>Civilians who joined the Speer Legion, as set forth in paragraph
(<span class='it'>H</span>) above, were required under threat of depriving them of food,
money and identity papers, to swear a solemn oath acknowledging
unconditional obedience to Adolf Hitler, the Fuehrer of Germany,
which was to them a hostile power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Lorraine, Civil Servants were obliged, in order to retain
their positions, to sign a declaration by which they acknowledged
the “return of their Country to the Reich”, pledged themselves
to obey without reservation the orders of their Chiefs and put
themselves “at the active service of the Fuehrer and the Great
National Socialist Germany”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A similar pledge was imposed on Alsatian Civil Servants by
threat of deportation or internment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These acts violated Article 45 of the Hague Regulations, 1907,
the laws and customs of war, the general principles of international
law and Article 6 (<span class='it'>b</span>) of the Charter.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>J</span>) <span class='sc'>Germanization of occupied territories</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>In certain occupied territories purportedly annexed to Germany
the defendants methodically and pursuant to plan endeavoured to
assimilate those territories politically, culturally, socially and economically
into the German Reich. The defendants endeavoured
to obliterate the former national character of these territories.
In pursuance of these plans and endeavours, the defendants forcibly
deported inhabitants who were predominantly non-German
and introduced thousands of German colonists.
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This plan included economic domination, physical conquest, installation
of puppet Governments, purported de jure annexation
and enforced conscription into the German Armed Forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was carried out in most of the Occupied Countries including:
Norway, France (particularly in the departments of Upper
Rhine, Lower Rhine, Moselle, Ardennes, Aisne, Nord, Meurthe
and Moselle), Luxembourg, the Soviet Union, Denmark, Belgium,
Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France in the Departments of the Aisne, the Nord, the Meurthe
and Moselle, and especially in that of the Ardennes, rural
properties were seized by a German state organization which tried
to have them exploited under German direction; the landowners
of these exploitations were dispossessed and turned into agricultural
labourers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Department of the Upper Rhine, the Lower Rhine and
the Moselle, the methods of Germanization were those of annexation
followed by conscription.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. From the month of August, 1940, officials who refused to
take the oath of allegiance to the Reich were expelled. On September
21st expulsions and deportation of populations began and on
November 22nd, 1940, more than 70,000 Lorrainers or Alsacians
were driven into the South zone of France. From July 31, 1941,
onwards, more than 100,000 persons were deported into the Eastern
regions of the Reich or to Poland. All the property of the deportees
or expelled persons was confiscated. At the same time,
80,000 Germans coming from the Saar or from Westphalia, were
installed in Lorraine and 2,000 farms belonging to French people
were transferred to Germans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. From 2nd January, 1942, all the young people of the Departments
of the Upper Rhine and the Lower Rhine, aged from 10 to
18 years, were incorporated in the Hitler Youth. The same thing
was done in the Moselle from 4th August, 1942. From 1940 all
the French schools were closed, their staffs expelled, and the German
school system was introduced in the three departments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. On the 28th September, 1940, an order applicable to the Department
of the Moselle ordained the Germanization of all the
surnames and christian names which were French in form. The
same thing was done from the 15th January, 1943, in the Departments
of the Upper Rhine and the Lower Rhine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. Two orders from the 23rd to 24th August, 1942, imposed by
force German nationality on French citizens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. On the 8th May, 1941, for the Upper Rhine and the Lower
Rhine, the 23rd April, 1941, for the Moselle, orders were promulgated
enforcing compulsory labour service on all French citizens
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
of either sex aged from 17 to 25 years. From the 1st January,
1942, for young men and from the 26th January, 1942, for young
girls, national labour service was effectively organized in the Moselle.
It was from the 27th August, 1942, in the Upper-Rhine and
in the Lower Rhine for young men only. The classes 1940, 1941,
1942 were called up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>6. These classes were retained in the Wehrmacht on the expiration
of their time and labour service. On the 19th August,
1942, an order instituted compulsory military service in the Moselle.
On the 25th August, 1942, the classes 1940-44 were called
up in three Departments. Conscription was enforced by the German
authorities in conformity with the provisions of German
legislation. The first revision boards took place from the 3rd September,
1942. Later in the Upper Rhine and the Lower Rhine new
levies were effected everywhere on classes 1928 to 1939 inclusive.
The French people who refused to obey these laws were considered
as deserters and their families were deported, while their
property was confiscated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These acts violated Articles 43, 46, 55 and 56 of the Hague Regulations,
1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles
of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized
nations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which
such crimes were committed and Article 6 (<span class='it'>b</span>) of the Charter.</p>

<h4>IX. Individual, group and organization responsibility for the offense stated in Count Three</h4>

<p class='pindent'>Reference is hereby made to Appendix A of this Indictment for
a statement of the responsibility of the individual defendants for
the offense set forth in this Count Three of the Indictment. Reference
is hereby made to Appendix B of this Indictment for a statement
of the responsibility of the groups, and organizations named
herein as criminal groups and organizations for the offense set
forth in this Count Three of the Indictment.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>COUNT FOUR—CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY</h2>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'>(Charter, Article 6, especially 6 (<span class='it'>c</span>).)</p>

<h4>X. Statement of the Offense</h4>

<p class='pindent'>All the defendants committed Crimes against Humanity during
a period of years preceding 8th May, 1945 in Germany and in all
those countries and territories occupied by the German armed
forces since 1st September, 1939 and in Austria and Czechoslovakia
and in Italy and on the High Seas.
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>All the defendants, acting in concert with others, formulated
and executed a common plan or conspiracy to commit Crimes
against Humanity as defined in Article 6(<span class='it'>c</span>) of the Charter. This
plan involved, among other things, the murder and persecution
of all who were or who were suspected of being hostile to the
Nazi Party and all who were or who were suspected of being opposed
to the common plan alleged in Count One.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The said Crimes against Humanity were committed by the defendants
and by other persons for whose acts the defendants are
responsible (under Article 6 of the Charter) as such other persons,
when committing the said War Crimes, performed their
acts in execution of a common plan and conspiracy to commit the
said War Crimes, in the formulation and execution of which plan
and conspiracy all the defendants participated as leaders, organizers,
instigators and accomplices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These methods and crimes constituted violations of international
conventions, of internal penal laws, of the general principles
of criminal law as derived from the criminal law of all civilized nations
and were involved in and part of a systematic course of
conduct. The said acts were contrary to Article 6 of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prosecution will rely upon the facts pleaded under Count
Three as also constituting Crimes against Humanity.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>A</span>) <span class='sc'>Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhumane acts committed against civilian populations before and during the war</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>For the purposes set out above, the defendants adopted a policy
of persecution, repression, and extermination of all civilians
in Germany who were, or who were believed to, or who were believed
likely to become, hostile to the Nazi Government and the
common plan or conspiracy described in Count One. They imprisoned
such persons without judicial process, holding them in
“protective custody” and concentration camps, and subjected
them to persecution, degradation, despoilment, enslavement, torture
and murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Special courts were established to carry out the will of the
conspirators; favoured branches or agencies of the State and
Party were permitted to operate outside the range even of nazified
law and to crush all tendencies and elements which were
considered “undesirable”. The various concentration camps included
Buchenwald, which was established in 1933 and Dachau,
which was established in 1934. At these and other camps the
civilians were put to slave labour, and murdered and ill-treated
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
by divers means, including those set out in Count Three above,
and these acts and policies were continued and extended to the
occupied countries after the 1st September, 1939, and until 8th
May, 1945.</p>

<h4>(<span class='it'>B</span>) <span class='sc'>Persecution on Political, Racial and Religious Grounds in execution of and in connection with the common plan mentioned in Count One</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>As above stated, in execution of and in connection with the
common plan mentioned in Count One, opponents of the German
Government were exterminated and persecuted. These persecutions
were directed against Jews. They were also directed against
persons whose political belief or spiritual aspirations were deemed
to be in conflict with the aims of the Nazis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jews were systematically persecuted since 1933; they were
deprived of their liberty, thrown into concentration camps where
they were murdered and ill-treated. Their property was confiscated.
Hundreds of thousands of Jews were so treated before
the 1st September, 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the 1st September, 1939, the persecution of the Jews
was redoubled: millions of Jews from Germany and from the
occupied Western Countries were sent to the Eastern Countries
for extermination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Particulars by way of example and without prejudice to the
production of evidence of other cases are as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis murdered amongst others Chancellor Dollfuss, the
Social Democrat Breitscheid and the Communist Thaelmann.
They imprisoned in concentration camps numerous political and
religious personages, for example Chancellor Schuschnigg and
Pastor Niemoeller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In November, 1938 by orders of the Chief of the Gestapo, anti-Jewish
demonstrations all over Germany took place. Jewish property
was destroyed, 30,000 Jews were arrested and sent to concentration
camps and their property confiscated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under paragraph VIII (<span class='it'>A</span>), above, millions of the persons there
mentioned as having been murdered and ill-treated were Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among other mass murders of Jews were the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Kislovdosk all Jews were made to give up their property:
2,000 were shot in an anti-tank ditch at Mineraliye Vodi: 4,300
other Jews were shot in the same ditch.

<p class='pindent'>Thousands of Jews were gassed weekly by means of gas-wagons
which broke down from overwork.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Germans retreated before the Soviet Army they exterminated
Jews rather than allow them to be liberated. Many
concentration camps and ghettos were set up in which Jews were
incarcerated and tortured, starved, subjected to merciless atrocities
and finally exterminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About 70,000 Jews were exterminated in Yugoslavia.</p>

1933, the date on which Hitler became Chancellor of
the German Republic. The term “ordinary cabinet”
as used herein means the Reich Ministers, i.e., heads
of departments of the central government; Reich

Council).</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'>Under the Fuehrer, these persons functioning in the foregoing
capacities and in association as a group, possessed and exercised
legislative, executive, administrative and political powers and
functions of a very high order in the system of German government.
Accordingly, they are charged with responsibility for the
policies adopted and put into effect by the government including
those which comprehended and involved the commission of the
crimes referred to in Counts, One, Two, Three and Four of the
Indictment.</p>

<h4><span style='font-size:smaller'>DAS KORPS DER POLITISCHEN LEITER DER NATIONALSOZIALISTISCHEN DEUTSCHEN ARBEITERPARTEI (LEADERSHIP CORPS OF THE NAZI PARTY)</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>“Das Korps der Politischen Leiter der Nationalsozialistischen
Deutschen Arbeiterpartei (Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party)”
referred to in the Indictment consists of persons who were at any
time, according to common Nazi terminology, “Politischer Leiter”
(Political Leaders) of any grade or rank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Politischen Leiter comprised the leaders of the various
functional offices of the Party (for example, the Reichsleitung,
or Party Reich Directorate, and the Gauleitung, or Party Gau
Directorate), as well as the territorial leaders of the Party (for
example, the Gauleiter).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Politischen Leiter were a distinctive and elite group within
the Nazi Party proper and as such were vested with special prerogatives.
They were organized according to the leadership principle
and were charged with planning, developing and imposing
upon their followers the policies of the Nazi Party. Thus the
territorial leaders among them were called Hoheitstraeger, or
bearers of sovereignty, and were entitled to call upon and utilize
the various Party formations when necessary for the execution
of Party policies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reference is hereby made to the allegations in Count One of
the Indictment showing that the Nazi Party was the central core
of the common plan or conspiracy therein set forth. The Politischen
Leiter, as a major power within the Nazi Party proper,
and functioning in the capacities above-described and in association
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
as a group, joined in the common plan or conspiracy, and accordingly
share responsibility for the crimes set forth in Counts
One, Two, Three and Four of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prosecution expressly reserves the right to request, at any
time before sentence is pronounced, that Politischer Leiter of
subordinate grades or ranks or of other types or classes, to be
specified by the prosecution, be excepted from further proceedings
in this Case No. 1, but without prejudice to other proceedings
or actions against them.</p>

<h4><span style='font-size:smaller'>DIE SCHUTZSTAFFELN DER NATIONALSOZIALISTISCHEN DEUTSCHEN ARBEITERPARTEI (COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE SS) INCLUDING DIE SICHERHEITSDIENST (COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE SD)</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>“Die Schutzstaffeln der Nationalsozialistischen Deutschen Arbeiterpartei
(commonly known as the SS) including Die Sicherheitsdienst
(commonly known as the SD)” referred to in the Indictment
consists of the entire corps of the SS and all offices,
departments, services, agencies, branches, formations, organizations
and groups of which it was at any time comprised or which
were at any time integrated in it, including but not limited to, the
Allgemeine SS, the Waffen SS, the SS Totenkopf Verbaende, SS
Polizei Regimente and the Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsfuehrers-SS
(commonly known as the SD).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The SS, originally established by Hitler in 1925 as an élite section
of the SA to furnish a protective guard for the Fuehrer and
Nazi Party leaders, became an independent formation of the Nazi
Party in 1934 under the leadership of the Reichsfuehrer-SS,
Heinrich Himmler. It was composed of voluntary members, selected
in accordance with Nazi biological, racial and political theories,
completely indoctrinated in Nazi ideology and pledged to
uncompromising obedience to the Fuehrer. After the accession
of the Nazi conspirators to power, it developed many departments,
agencies, formations and branches and extended its influence
and control over numerous fields of governmental and
Party activity. Through Heinrich Himmler, as Reichsfuehrer-SS
and Chief of the German Police, agencies and units of the SS and
of the Reich were joined in operation to form a unified repressive
police force. The Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsfuehrers-SS
(commonly known as the SD), a department of the SS, was developed
into a vast espionage and counter-intelligence system
which operated in conjunction with the Gestapo and criminal police
in detecting, suppressing and eliminating tendencies, groups
and individuals deemed hostile or potentially hostile to the Nazi
Party, its leaders, principles and objectives, and eventually was
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
combined with the Gestapo and criminal police in a single security
police department, the Reich Main Security Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other branches of the SS developed into an armed force and
served in the wars of aggression referred to in Counts One and
Two of the Indictment. Through other departments and branches
the SS controlled the administration of concentration camps and
the execution of Nazi racial, biological and resettlement policies.
Through its numerous functions and activities it served as the
instrument for insuring the domination of Nazi ideology and protecting
and extending the Nazi regime over Germany and occupied
territories. It thus participated in and is responsible for
the crimes referred to in Counts One, Two, Three and Four of
the Indictment.</p>

<h4><span style='font-size:smaller'>DIE GEHEIME STAATSPOLIZEI (SECRET STATE POLICE, COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE GESTAPO)</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>“Die Geheime Staatspolizei (Secret State Police, commonly
known as the Gestapo)” referred to in the Indictment consists of
the headquarters, departments, offices, branches and all the forces
and personnel of the Geheime Staatspolizei organized or existing
at any time after 30 January 1933, including the Geheime Staatspolizei
of Prussia and equivalent secret or political police forces of
the Reich and the components thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gestapo was created by the Nazi conspirators immediately
after their accession to power, first in Prussia by the defendant
GOERING and shortly thereafter in all other states in the Reich.
These separate secret and political police forces were developed
into a centralized, uniform organization operating through a central
headquarters and through a network of regional offices in
Germany and in occupied territories. Its officials and operatives
were selected on the basis of unconditional acceptance of Nazi
ideology, were largely drawn from members of the SS, and were
trained in SS and SD schools. It acted to suppress and eliminate
tendencies, groups and individuals deemed hostile or potentially
hostile to the Nazi Party, its leaders, principles and objectives,
and to repress resistance and potential resistance to German control
in occupied territories. In performing these functions it
operated free from legal control, taking any measures it deemed
necessary for the accomplishment of its missions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through its purposes, activities and the means it used, it participated
in and is responsible for the commission of the crimes
set forth in Counts One, Two, Three and Four of the Indictment.
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span></p>

<h4><span style='font-size:smaller'>DIE STURMABTEILUNGEN DER NATIONALSOZIALISTISCHEN DEUTSCHEN ARBEITERPARTEI (COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE SA)</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>“Die Sturmabteilungen der Nationalsozialistischen Deutschen
Arbeiterpartei (commonly known as the SA)” referred to in the
Indictment was a formation of the Nazi Party under the immediate
jurisdiction of the Fuehrer, organized on military lines,
whose membership was composed of volunteers serving as political
soldiers of the Party. It was one of the earliest formations
of the Nazi Party and the original guardian of the National Socialist
movement. Founded in 1921 as a voluntary militant formation,
it was developed by the Nazi conspirators before their
accession to power into a vast private army and utilized for the
purpose of creating disorder, and terrorizing and eliminating political
opponents. It continued to serve as an instrument for the
physical, ideological and military training of Party members and
as a reserve for the German armed forces. After the launching of
the wars of aggression, referred to in Counts One and Two of
the Indictment, the SA not only operated as an organization for
military training but provided auxiliary police and security
forces in occupied territories, guarded prisoner-of-war camps
and concentration camps and supervised and controlled persons
forced to labour in Germany and occupied territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through its purposes and activities and the means it used, it
participated in and is responsible for the commission of the
crimes set forth in Counts One, Two, Three and Four of the Indictment.</p>

<h4><span style='font-size:smaller'>GENERAL STAFF AND HIGH COMMAND OF THE GERMAN ARMED FORCES</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>The “General Staff and High Command of the German Armed
Forces” referred to in the Indictment consist of those individuals
who between February 1938 and May 1945 were the highest commanders
of the Wehrmacht, the Army, the Navy, and the Air
Forces. The individuals comprising this group are the persons
who held the following appointments:</p>

at the highest level in the German Armed Forces Organization,
these persons had a major responsibility for the planning, preparation,
initiation and waging of illegal wars as set forth in
Counts One and Two of the Indictment and for the War Crimes
and Crimes against Humanity involved in the execution of the
common plan or conspiracy set forth in Counts Three and Four
of the Indictment.</p>

<h4>STATEMENT OF RESERVATION TO THE INDICTMENT</h4>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the signing of the Indictment in Berlin on 6 October 1945,
Justice Jackson, on behalf of the United States, filed the following
statement of reservation with the Tribunal and with the Chief
Prosecutors of France, Great Britain, and Soviet Russia:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>Dear Sirs:</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>In the Indictment of German War Criminals signed today, reference
is made to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and certain other
territories as being within the area of the USSR. This language
is proposed by Russia and is accepted to avoid the delay which
would be occasioned by insistence on an alteration in the text. The
Indictment is signed subject to this reservation and understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have no authority either to admit or to challenge, on behalf
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
of the United States of America, Soviet claims to sovereignty
over such territories. Nothing, therefore, in this Indictment is
to be construed as a recognition by the United States of such sovereignty
or as indicating any attitude, either on the part of the
United States or on the part of the undersigned, toward any claim
to recognition of such sovereignty.</p>

</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>The representative of the United States has found it necessary
to make certain reservations as to the possible bearing of certain
language in the Indictment upon political questions which are
considered to be irrelevant to the proceedings before this Tribunal.
However, it is considered appropriate to disclose such reservations
that they may not be unknown to the Tribunal in the event
they should at any time be considered relevant. For that purpose,
the foregoing copy is filed.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span><h1 id='pg83a'>Chapter IV<br/> MOTIONS, RULINGS, AND EXPLANATORY MATERIAL<br/> RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THE DEFENDANTS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Although 24 individuals were named as defendants in the Indictment
signed in Berlin on 6 October 1945, only 22 remained as
defendants when the trial commenced on 20 November. The
number had been reduced by the suicide of Robert Ley and by the
Tribunal’s severance of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach
from the proceedings. Of the 22 surviving defendants only 20
appeared in the prisoners’ dock at the opening of court. Martin
Bormann, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, was
presumed to be alive and at large. Ernst Kaltenbrunner had been
hospitalized by a cranial hemorrhage, and as a consequence was
unable to be present at the trial save for one period of a few days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Defense counsel for two of the twenty men in the prisoners’
dock, Hess and Streicher, sought to have the proceedings against
their clients dismissed on the grounds of their mental incapacity
to stand trial. Expert medical examiners concluded that both
defendants were fit to defend themselves, and the proceedings
against them were resumed. One of them, Hess, who had claimed
to be a victim of amnesia, created something of a sensation by
confessing in open court that he had only been pretending to suffer
from amnesia and that his memory was actually in good repair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fuller explanatory notes concerning the positions taken by the
prosecution and the defense and the actions of the Tribunal in the
cases of each of these six defendants, together with significant
papers bearing on these matters, are printed hereinafter.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg83b'>1. ROBERT LEY</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Pending the opening of the trial on 20 November 1945 the defendants
were held in the prison at the Palace of Justice in Nurnberg,
under the custody of the United States Army. In the evening
of October 25 the guard on watch before the cell of Robert
Ley noticed that the prisoner had maintained the same position
for some time without moving. The guard entered the cell to
find that although the prison officials had taken every known precaution,
Ley had succeeded in committing suicide. Ley had ripped
the hemmed edge from a towel, twisted it, soaked it in water, and
fashioned it into a crude noose which he fastened to an overhead
toilet flush pipe. He had then stuffed his mouth with rags, apparently
torn from his own underwear. When he seated himself,
strangulation was produced, and Robert Ley had succeeded in accomplishing
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
his exit from the court of judgment, and from the
world of living men. A farewell message written by Ley, together
with other statements made by him during imprisonment,
may be found at the end of the last volume (<span class='it'>Statements</span> XI-XIII).</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg84a'>2. GUSTAV KRUPP von BOHLEN und HALBACH</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The name of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach stood
thirteenth on the list of twenty-four defendants accused in the
Indictment signed in Berlin on 6 October 1945. On 4 November
counsel for Krupp filed a motion requesting that the Tribunal defer
proceedings against the defendant until his health permitted
him to stand trial, and that he should not be tried in his absence.
The Tribunal on 5 November appointed a medical commission consisting
of representatives of the Soviet Union, France, Great
Britain, and the United States, to examine Krupp and determine
whether he was fit to stand trial. On 12 November the Chief of
Counsel for the United States filed an answer opposing the motion
of defense counsel and proposing that Gustav Krupp should not
be dismissed from the proceedings unless Alfried Krupp, the son
and sole owner of the Krupp Works, were substituted as a defendant.
On 14 November, before the opening of the trial itself,
the Tribunal heard oral argument by the prosecution and defense,
in which substantially the same views were presented as had been
previously expressed in the written motions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal on 15 November announced its ruling postponing
the proceedings against Gustav Krupp, but retaining the Indictment
charges against him on the docket for later trial if his physical
and mental condition should permit. The ruling stated that
the question of adding another name to the Indictment would be
considered later. Thereupon, on 16 November, the American Chief
of Counsel filed a memorandum with the Tribunal stating as a
matter of record that the United States was not committed to
participate in any subsequent four-power trial. On the same day
the Soviet and French Chief Prosecutors joined the United States
Chief of Counsel in a motion formally designating Alfried Krupp
a defendant. On the following day the Tribunal announced its
ruling rejecting the motion to add the name of Alfried Krupp as
a defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The significant papers pertaining to these questions are set
forth below.

<p class='line0'>To: The International Military Tribunal Nurnberg.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>As defending counsel to the accused Dr. Gustav Krupp von
Bohlen und Halbach I beg to state that the proceedings against
this accused be deferred until he is again fit for trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At any rate I request that the accused be not tried in his absence.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'><span class='it'>Reasons</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>By Article 12 of the Statute of the International Military
Tribunal this court has the right to try an accused in his absence
if he cannot be found, or if the court deem this necessary for
other reasons in the interest of justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 75 year old accused Krupp von Bohlen has for a long time
been incapable of trial or examination owing to his severe physical
and mental infirmities. He is not in a position to be in contact
with the outside world nor to make or receive statements. The
indictment was served on him on the 19th October 1945 by a representative
of the International Military Tribunal by placing the
document on his bed. The accused had no knowledge of this
event. Consequently he is not aware of the existence of an indictment.
Naturally therefore he is not capable of communicating
either with his defense counsel nor with other persons on the
subject of his defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To prove the above, 2 medical certificates are enclosed viz. that
of the court medical expert Doctor Karl Gersdorf of Werfen
Salzburg of 9th September 1945 and that of the Professor Doctor
Otto Gerke of Bedgnstein of 13th September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Latterly Herr Krupp von Bohlen has been examined several
times by American military doctors. As far as it is possible I
should like to request for another complete medical examination.
If the accused is unable to appear before the court, then according
to article 12 of the statute he could only be tried if the court
deemed it necessary in the interests of justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever may be understood by the phrase “in the interests of
justice” it would hardly be objective justice to try a defendant
accused of such serious crimes, if he were not informed of the
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
contents of the accusations or if he were not given the chance to
conduct his own defense or instruct a defense counsel. Particularly
is he in no condition to comprehend the following
rights of an accused set out in the statute:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. By article 16 Section (a) of the statute a copy of the indictment
in a language which he understands will be served on the
accused at a suitably appointed time. In the first place this concerns
the statement which the accused has to render on inquiry
as to whether he admits his guilt or not, a statement which is of
particular importance for the course of the trial and for the decision
of the tribunal. This is all the more important as this
statement regarding guilt or innocence can only be made exclusively
by the accused himself according to his own judgment
and after examining his conscience. So far as the procedure is
admissible at all, the defense counsel could not at the request of
the court express himself on the question of guilt as such a declaration
presupposes the possibility of communication and understanding
with the accused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also the defendant could not exercise the right to the last word
to which he is entitled according to Article 24 Section f.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The legislators who set up these guarantees for the defense,
cannot wish to deny them undeservedly to an accused who cannot
make use of them owing to illness. If by Article 12 of the
statute the trial of an absent defendant is allowed then this exception
to the rule can only be applied to a defendant who is unwilling
to appear though able to do so. As is the case with the
criminal procedure rules of nearly all countries, it is on this principle
that the rules and regulations concerning the trial of absent
defendants are based.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Lawyer</p>

<h4>B. <span class='it'>ANSWER FOR THE UNITED STATES TO THE MOTION FILED IN BEHALF OF KRUPP VON BOHLEN</span></h4>

<p class='noindent'>To the International Military Tribunal:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States respectfully opposes the application on behalf
of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach that his trial be
“deferred until he is again fit for trial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal should grant this application, the practical effect
would be to quash all proceedings, for all time, against Krupp von
Bohlen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears that Krupp should not be arrested and brought to
the court room for trial. But the plea is that the Tribunal also
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
excuse him from being tried <span class='it'>in absentia</span>. This form of trial admittedly
is authorized by Article 12 of the Charter of the Tribunal.
Of course, trial <span class='it'>in absentia</span> in the circumstances of the
case is an unsatisfactory proceeding either for prosecution or
for defense. But the request that Krupp von Bohlen be neither
brought to court nor tried in his absence is based on the contention
that “the interest of justice” requires that he be thus excused
from any form of trial. Public interests, which transcend all
private considerations, require that Krupp von Bohlen shall not
be dismissed unless some other representative of the Krupp armament
and munitions interests be substituted. These public interests
are as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four generations of the Krupp family have owned and operated
the great armament and munitions plants which have been the
chief source of Germany’s war supplies. For over 130 years this
family has been the focus, the symbol, and the beneficiary of the
most sinister forces engaged in menacing the peace of Europe.
During the period between the two World Wars the management
of these enterprises was chiefly in defendant Krupp von Bohlen.
It was at all times, however, a Krupp family enterprise. Krupp
von Bohlen was only a nominal owner himself; his wife, Bertha
Krupp, owned the bulk of the stock. About 1937 their son, Alfried
Krupp, became plant manager and was actively associated
in policy-making and executive management thereafter. In 1940,
Krupp von Bohlen, getting on in years, became Chairman of the
Board of the concerns, thus making way for Alfried, who became
President. In 1943, Alfried became sole owner of the Krupp enterprises
by agreement between the family and the Nazi government,
for the purpose of perpetuating this business in Krupp family
control. It is evident that the future menace of this concern
lies in continuance of the tradition under Alfried, now reported to
be an internee of the British Army of the Rhine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To drop Krupp von Bohlen from this case without substitution
of Alfried, drops from the case the entire Krupp family, and defeats
any effective judgment against the German armament makers.
Whether this would be “in the interests of justice” will appear
from the following recital of only the most significant items
of evidence now in possession of the United States as to the activities
of Krupp von Bohlen, in which his son Alfried at all times
aided, as did other associates in the vast armament enterprises,
all plotting to bring about the second World War, and to aid in its
ruthless and illegal conduct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the first World War, the Krupp family and their associates
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
failed to comply with Germany’s disarmament agreements,
but all secretly and knowingly conspired to evade them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the March 1, 1940 issue of the Krupp Magazine, the defendant
Krupp stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted and had to maintain Krupp in spite of all opposition,
as an armament plant for the later future, even if in
camouflaged form. I could only speak in the smallest, most
intimate circles, about the real reasons which made me undertake
the changeover of the plants for certain lines of production.
* * * Even the Allied snoop commissioners
were duped. * * * After the accession to power of Adolf
Hitler, I had the satisfaction of reporting to the Fuehrer that
Krupp stood ready, after a short warming-up period, to begin
rearmament of the German people without any gaps of
experience * * *”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Krupp von Bohlen (and Alfried Krupp as well) lent his name,
prestige, and financial support to bring the Nazi Party, with an
avowed program of renewing the war, into power over the German
State. On April 25, 1931 von Bohlen acted as chairman of
the Association of German Industry to bring it into line with
Nazi policies. On May 30, 1933 he wrote to Schacht that “it is
proposed to initiate a collection in the most far-reaching circles
of German industry, including agriculture and the banking world,
which is to be put at the disposal of the Fuehrer of the NSDAP in
the name of ‘The Hitler Fund’ * * * I have accepted the
chairmanship of the management council.” Krupp contributed
from the treasury of the main Krupp company 4,738,446 Marks
to the Nazi Party fund. In June, 1935 he contributed 100,000
Marks to the Nazi Party out of his personal account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi Party did not succeed in obtaining control of Germany
until it obtained support of the industrial interests, largely
through the influence of Krupp. Alfried first became a Nazi
Party member and later von Bohlen did also. The Krupp influence
was powerful in promoting the Nazi plan to incite aggressive
warfare in Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Krupp von Bohlen strongly advocated and supported Germany’s
withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference and from the
League of Nations. He personally made repeated public speeches
approving and inciting Hitler’s program of aggression; on April
6th and 7th, 1938 two speeches approved annexation of Austria;
on October 13, 1938 he publicly approved Nazi occupation of the
Sudetenland; on September 4, 1939 he approved the invasion of
Poland; on May 6, 1941 he spoke commemorating the success of
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
Nazi arms in the West. Alfried Krupp also made speeches to the
same general effect. The Krupps were thus one of the most persistent
and influential forces that made this war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Krupps also were the chief factor in getting ready for the
war. In January, 1944 in a speech at the University of Berlin,
von Bohlen boasted, “Through years of secret work, scientific and
basic groundwork was laid in order to be ready again to work
for the German Armed Forces at the appointed hour without
loss of time or experience.” In 1937, before Germany went to
war, the Krupps booked orders to equip satellite governments on
approval of the German High Command. Krupp contributed 20,000
Marks to the defendant Rosenberg for the purpose of spreading
Nazi propaganda abroad. In a memorandum of October 12,
1939, a Krupp official wrote offering to mail propaganda pamphlets
abroad at Krupp expense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once the war was on, Krupps, both von Bohlen and Alfried being
directly responsible therefor, led German industry in violating
treaties and International Law by employing enslaved laborers,
impressed and imported from nearly every country occupied
by Germany, and by compelling prisoners of war to make arms
and munitions for use against their own countries. There is ample
evidence that in Krupp’s custody and service they were underfed
and overworked, misused and inhumanly treated. Captured records
show that in September, 1944, Krupp concerns were working
54,990 foreign workers and 18,902 prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, the Krupp companies profited greatly from destroying
the peace of the world through support of the Nazi program.
The rearmament of Germany gave Krupp huge orders and corresponding
profits. Before this Nazi menace to the peace began,
the Krupps were operating at a substantial loss. But the net
profits after taxes, gifts and reserves steadily rose with rise of
Nazi rearmament, being as follows:</p>

<table id='tab13' summary='' class='center'>

</table>

<p class='pindent'>The book value of the Krupp concerns mounted from 75,962,000
Marks on October 1, 1933 to 237,316,093 Marks on October
1, 1943. Even this included many going concerns in occupied
countries carried at a book value of only 1 Mark each. These
figures are subject to the adjustments and controversies usual
with financial statements of each vast enterprise but approximately
reflect the facts about property and operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The services of Alfried Krupp and of von Bohlen and their
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
family to the war aims of the Nazi Party were so outstanding
that the Krupp enterprises were made a special exception to the
policy of nationalization of industries. Hitler said that he would
be “prepared to arrange for any possible safeguarding for the
continued existence of the works as a family enterprise; it would
be simplest to issue ‘lex Krupp’ to start with.” After short
negotiations, this was done. A decree of November 12, 1943 preserves
the Krupp works as a family enterprise in Alfried Krupp’s
control and recites that it is done in recognition of the fact that
“for 132 years the firm of Fried. Krupp, as a family enterprise
has achieved outstanding and unique merits for the armed
strength of the German people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has at all times been the position of the United States that
the great industrialists of Germany were guilty of the crimes
charged in this Indictment quite as much as its politicians, diplomats,
and soldiers. Its Chief of Counsel on June 7, 1945, in a
report to President Truman, released by him and with his approval,
stated that the accusations of crimes include individuals
in authority in the financial, industrial, and economic life of Germany,
as well as others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pursuant thereto, the United States, with approval of the Secretary
of State, proposed to indict Alfried Krupp, son of Krupp
von Bohlen, and President and owner of the Krupp concern. The
Prosecutors representing the Soviet Union, the French Republic,
and the United Kingdom unanimously opposed inclusion of Alfried
Krupp. This is not said in criticism of them or their judgment.
The necessity of limiting the number of defendants was
considered by representatives of the other three nations to preclude
the addition of Alfried Krupp. Learning the serious condition
of Krupp von Bohlen, immediately upon service of the Indictment,
the United States again called a meeting of Prosecutors
and proposed an amendment to include Alfried Krupp. Again
the proposal of the United States was defeated by a vote of three-to-one.
If now the Tribunal shall exercise its discretion to excuse
from trial the one indicted member of the Krupp family, one of
the chief purposes of the United States will be defeated, and it
is submitted that such a result is not “in the interests of justice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States respectfully submits that no greater disservice
to the future peace of the world could be done than to excuse
the entire Krupp family and the armament enterprise from this
trial in which aggressive war-making is sought to be condemned.
The “interests of justice” cannot be determined without taking
into account justice to the men of four generations whose lives
have been taken or menaced by Krupp munitions and Krupp armament,
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
and those of the future who can feel no safety if such persons
as this escape all condemnation in proceedings such as this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While of course the United States can not, without the concurrence
of one other power, indict a new defendant, it can under
the Charter alone oppose this Motion. The United States respectfully
urges that if the favor now sought by Krupp von Bohlen
is to be granted, it be upon the condition that Alfried Krupp be
substituted or added as a defendant so that there may be a representative
of the Krupp interests before the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be suggested that bringing in a new defendant would
result in delay. Admitting, however, that a delay which cannot
exceed a few days may be occasioned, it is respectfully suggested
that the precise day that this trial will start is a less important
consideration than whether it is to fail of one of its principal
purposes. The American Prosecution Staff has been by long
odds the longest and farthest away from home in this endeavor.
On personal, as well as public interest considerations, it deplores
delay. But we think the future, as well as the contemporary
world, cannot fail to be shocked if, in a trial in which it is sought
to condemn aggressive war-making, the Krupp industrial empire
is completely saved from condemnation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The complete trial brief of the United States on Krupp von
Bohlen, with copies of the documents on which his culpability is
asserted, will be made available to the Tribunal if it is desired as
evidence concerning him and Alfried Krupp and the Krupp concerns.</p>

<h4>C. <span class='it'>RULING OF THE TRIBUNAL ON 15 NOVEMBER 1945</span></h4>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'>IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION OF COUNSEL FOR KRUPP VON BOHLEN FOR POSTPONEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THIS DEFENDANT</p>

<p class='pindent'>Council for Gustav Krupp von Bohlen has applied to the Tribunal
for postponement of the proceedings against this defendant
on the ground that his physical and mental condition are such
that he is incapable of understanding the proceedings against
him and of presenting any defence that he may have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On November 5, the Tribunal appointed a medical commission
composed of the following physicians: R. E. Tunbridge, Brigadier,
O.B.E., M.D., M.Sc., F.R.C.P., Consulting Physician, British
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
Army of the Rhine; Rene Piedelievre, M.D., professor a la
Faculte de Medicine de Paris; Expert pres les Tribuneaux; Nicolas
Kurshakov, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Medical Institute
of Moscow; Chief Internist, Commissariat of Public Health,
U.S.S.R.; Eugene Sepp, M.D., Emeritus Professor of Neurology,
Medical Institute of Moscow; Member, Academy of Sciences,
U.S.S.R.; Eugene Krasnushkin, M.D.; Professor of Psychiatry,
Medical Institute of Moscow; Bertram Schaffner, Major, Medical
Corps, Neuropsychiatrist, Army of the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Commission has reported to the Tribunal that it is unanimously
of the opinion that Krupp von Bohlen suffers from senile
softening of the brain; that his mental condition is such that he
is incapable of understanding court procedure and of understanding
or cooperating in interrogations; that his physical state
is such that he cannot be moved without endangering his life;
and that his condition is unlikely to improve but rather will
deteriorate further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal accepts the findings of the medical commission
to which exception is taken neither by the Prosecution nor by the
Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 12 of the Charter authorizes the trial of a defendant
<span class='it'>in absentia</span> if found by the Tribunal to be “necessary in the interests
of justice”. It is contended on behalf of the Chief Prosecutors
that in the interests of justice Krupp von Bohlen should be tried
<span class='it'>in absentia</span>, despite his physical and mental condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the decision of the Tribunal that upon the facts presented
the interests of justice do not require that Krupp von Bohlen
be tried <span class='it'>in absentia</span>. The Charter of the Tribunal envisages a
fair trial in which the Chief Prosecutors may present the evidence
in support of an indictment and the defendants may
present such defence as they may believe themselves to have.
Where nature rather than flight or contumacy has rendered such
a trial impossible, it is not in accordance with justice that the
case should proceed in the absence of a defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal <span class='it'>Orders that</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The application for postponement of the proceeding against
Gustav Krupp von Bohlen is granted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. The charges in the indictment against Gustav Krupp von
Bohlen shall be retained upon the docket of the Tribunal for
trial hereafter, if the physical and mental condition of the Defendant
should permit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further questions raised by the Chief Prosecutors, including
the question of adding another name to the Indictment, will be
considered later.
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span></p>

<h4>D. <span class='it'>MEMORANDUM FILED BY THE UNITED STATES CHIEF OF COUNSEL</span></h4>

<p class='noindent'>TO THE INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States, by its Chief of Counsel, respectfully shows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The order of the Tribunal, that “The charges in the indictment
against Gustav Krupp von Bohlen shall be retained upon the
docket of the Tribunal for trial hereafter, if the physical and
mental condition of the Defendant should permit,” requires the
United States to make clear its attitude toward subsequent trials,
which may have been misapprehended by the Tribunal, in order
that no inference be drawn from its silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States never has committed itself to participate in
any Four Power trial except the one now pending. The purpose
of accusing organizations and groups as criminal was to reach,
through subsequent and more expeditious trials before Military
Government or military courts, a large number of persons. According
to estimates of the United States Army, a finding that
the organizations presently accused are criminal organizations
would result in the trial of approximately 130,000 persons now
held in the custody of the United States Army; and I am uninformed
as to those held by others. It has been the great purpose
of the United States from the beginning to bring into this one
trial all that is necessary by way of defendants and evidence to
reach the large number of persons responsible for the crimes
charged without going over the entire evidence again. We, therefore,
desire that it be a matter of record that the United States
has not been, and is not by this order, committed to participate
in any subsequent Four Power trial. It reserves freedom to
determine that question after the capacity to handle one trial
under difficult conditions has been tested.</p>

<h4>E. <span class='it'>MOTION BY THE SOVIET, FRENCH, AND AMERICAN CHIEF PROSECUTORS TO DESIGNATE ALFRIED KRUPP AS A DEFENDANT</span></h4>

<p class='noindent'>TO THE INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the Indictment, the motion of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen
und Halbach and the answers thereto, and all proceedings had
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
thereunder, the Committee of Prosecutors created under the
Charter hereby designates Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach
as a defendant and respectfully moves that the Indictment
be amended by adding the name of Alfried Krupp von Bohlen
und Halbach as a defendant, and by the addition of appropriate
allegations in reference to him in the Appendix A thereof. It
also moves that the time of Alfried Krupp be shortened from
thirty days to December 2, 1945. For this purpose, the Committee
of Prosecutors adopts and ratifies the Answer filed on
behalf of the United States on November 12, 1945 in response
to the Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach motion, and the
motion made by Robert H. Jackson in open Court on behalf of

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.5em;'>Sitting at Nurnberg, Germany, on 17 November 1945,</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:.5em;'>In session 1500 hours</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The motion to amend the indictment by
adding the name of Alfried Krupp has been considered by the
Tribunal in all its aspects and the application is rejected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will now adjourn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(Whereupon at 1505 the Tribunal adjourned.)</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg94a'>3. MARTIN BORMANN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>As the day of the trial approached, Martin Bormann, although
named as a defendant in the Indictment, had not yet been apprehended
despite the efforts of numerous special investigators. On
17 November 1945 the Tribunal requested the views of the prosecution
on the question of trial <span class='it'>in absentia</span>. Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe,
Deputy Chief Prosecutor of Great Britain, reviewed the information
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
available and, on behalf of the United States and
France as well as Great Britain, stated that: “The prosecution
cannot say that the matter is beyond a probability that Bormann
is dead. There is still the clear possibility that he is alive.”
Notice had been publicly given, in the manner prescribed by the
Tribunal, that Bormann had been named a defendant, and it was
therefore suggested that the case fell within Article 12 of the
Charter authorizing trial <span class='it'>in absentia</span>. The Soviet representative
expressed concurrence; whereupon Lord Justice Lawrence, presiding,
orally announced the Tribunal’s ruling, on the same date:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tribunal has decided that, in pursuance of Article 12
of the Charter, it will try the Defendant Bormann in his absence,
and it announces that counsel for the Defendant Bormann
will be appointed to defend him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter, the counsel named to defend Bormann moved for
postponement of the proceedings against the defendant. The
Tribunal announced on 22 November through Lord Justice Lawrence,
presiding, that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“* * * in view of the fact that the provisions of the
Charter and the Tribunal’s rule of procedure have been
strictly carried out in the notices which have been given, and
the fact that counsel for Bormann will have ample time before
they are called upon to present defense on his behalf,
the motion is denied.”</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg95a'>4. ERNST KALTENBRUNNER</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On 18 November 1945, two days before the opening of the trial,
Kaltenbrunner suffered a spontaneous subarachanoid hemorrhage
and was taken to the hospital for treatment. He remained there
until 6 December, when he was returned to the jail. He attended
the 10 December session of the Tribunal and was in court for
several days thereafter, but his condition deteriorated so that it
was necessary to return him to the hospital for further treatment.
Medical opinion expects at this writing (23 January), that
he will be required to remain under hospital care for a considerable
period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 2 January Kaltenbrunner’s counsel, Dr. Kauffmann, requested
the Tribunal to postpone the case against his client because
of his illness. The Tribunal ruled (1) that the prosecution
should proceed with any evidence which it proposed to direct
against the criminality of organizations with which Kaltenbrunner
was connected, (2) that any prosecution evidence directed
against Kaltenbrunner as an individual should be withheld until
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
the prosecution reached that part of its case in which it had
planned to trace the responsibility of individual defendants, and
(3) that Kaltenbrunner’s case should properly be left until the
end of this section of the evidence. If at that time the defendant
should be still unable to be present in court, the Tribunal ruled
that “the evidence will have to be given in his absence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A closed session followed at which the Tribunal heard both the
prosecution and defense counsel, as a result of which the Tribunal
modified its ruling. Since the prosecution’s evidence was so inextricably
mingled that it was impossible to divide it between
that which bore against Kaltenbrunner as an individual and that
which bore against the organizations which he headed, the Tribunal
ruled that it would hear the prosecution’s evidence in its
entirety. Counsel for Kaltenbrunner, however, was given the
privilege of cross-examining at a later date any witnesses which
the prosecution might call against Kaltenbrunner. The Tribunal
pointed out that defense counsel would also, of course, have an
opportunity to deal with any documentary evidence against Kaltenbrunner
when the time came for the presentation of the defense
case.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg96a'>5. JULIUS STREICHER</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Counsel for Streicher orally requested the Tribunal, on 15 November
1945, to appoint a commission to make a psychiatric examination
of the defendant. This was requested for the Defense
Counsel’s “own protection”, although the defendant thought himself
normal and did not wish an examination. The Tribunal directed
the Defense Counsel to make his motion in writing. The
Soviet prosecutor suggested to the Tribunal the desirability of
having such an examination, if it were necessary at all, while
medical experts from the Soviet Union remained in Nurnberg.
Subsequently a panel of three medical experts examined Streicher
and reported that he was fit to stand trial. The Tribunal thereupon
ruled, Lord Justice Lawrence making the announcement
orally in court on 22 November, that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“* * * the Tribunal wishes me to announce the decision
on the application made on behalf of the Defendant
Julius Streicher by his counsel that his condition should be
examined. It has been examined by three medical experts
on behalf of the Tribunal and their report has been submitted
to and considered by the Tribunal; and it is as follows:</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘1. The Defendant Julius Streicher is sane.
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘2. The Defendant Julius Streicher is fit to appear before
the Tribunal, and to present his defense.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg97a'>6. RUDOLF HESS</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Through his pre-trial confinement in the Nurnberg prison,
Hess had consistently maintained that he was suffering from
amnesia and therefore could not remember facts concerning his
previous activities. In order to determine Hess’ mental state
the Tribunal appointed a commission of psychiatric experts from
the United States, Great Britain, Russia, and France, to examine
the defendant and furnish a report. After receiving the medical
report the Tribunal directed that oral argument by the prosecution
and defense counsel should be heard on 30 November 1945
concerning the issues raised by the medical report. Prior to the
oral argument, both the prosecution and defense filed written
motions which outlined substantially the positions later taken in
court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the conclusion of the oral arguments, the Tribunal called
upon Hess for a statement. Hess thereupon announced that he
had simulated loss of memory for tactical reasons and that his
memory was “again in order.” On the following day the Tribunal
ruled that Hess was capable of standing trial and that his
case would proceed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The papers pertaining to these matters are set out below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. Counsel for the defendant Hess has made application to the
Tribunal to appoint an expert designated by the medical faculty
of the University of Zurich or of Lausanne to examine the defendant
Hess with reference to his mental competence and capacity
to stand trial. This application is denied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal has requested the commission to examine the

sane or not, and on this last issue the Tribunal wishes to be
advised whether the defendant is of sufficient intellect to comprehend
the course of the proceedings of the trial so as to make a

<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>1. There are no relevant physical abnormalities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. His mental state is of a mixed type. He is an unstable man,
and what is technically called a psychopathic personality. The
evidence of his illness in the past four years, as presented by
one of us who has had him under his care in England, indicates
that he has had a delusion of poisoning, and other similar paranoid
ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Partly as a reaction to the failure of his mission, these abnormalities
got worse, and led to suicidal attempts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, he has a marked hysterical tendency, which has
led to the development of various symptoms, notably a loss of
memory, which lasted from November 1943 to June 1944, and
which resisted all efforts at treatment. A second loss of memory
began in February 1945 and lasted till the present. This amnesic
symptom will eventually clear, when circumstances change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. At the moment he is not insane in the strict sense. His loss
of memory will not entirely interfere with his comprehension of
the proceedings, but it will interfere with his ability to make his
defense, and to understand details of the past, which arise in
evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. We recommend that further evidence should be obtained by
narco-analysis and that if the Court decides to proceed with the
Trial, the question should afterwards be reviewed on psychiatric
grounds.”</p>

<p class='hang'>MEMORANDUM TO: Brigadier General Wm. L. Mitchell, General
Secretary for the International Military Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In response to request of the Tribunal that the defendant
Rudolf Hess be examined, the undersigned psychiatrists examined
Rudolf Hess on November 15th and 19th, 1945, in his cell
in the Military Prison in Nurnberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following examinations were made: physical, neurological
and psychological.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, documents were studied bearing information concerning
his personal development and career. Reports concerning
the period of his stay in England were scrutinized. The results
of all psychological, special psychometric examinations and
observations carried out by the prison psychiatrist and his staff
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
were studied. Information was also derived from the official interrogation
of the defendant on November 14th and November
16th, 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) We find, as a result of our examinations and investigations,
that Rudolf Hess is suffering from hysteria characterized
in part by loss of memory. The nature of this loss of memory
is such that it will not interfere with his comprehension of the
proceedings, but it will interfere with his response to questions
relating to his past and will interfere with his undertaking his
defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition there is a conscious exaggeration of his loss of
memory and a tendency to exploit it to protect himself against
examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) We consider that the existing hysterical behaviour which
the defendant reveals was initiated as a defense against the circumstances
in which he found himself while in England; that it
has now become in part habitual and that it will continue as long
as he remains under the threat of imminent punishment, even
though it may interfere with his undertaking a more normal form
of defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) It is the unanimous conclusion of the undersigned that
Rudolf Hess is not insane at the present time in the strict sense
of the word.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) Conclusions</p>

<p class='pindent'>After observation and an examination of Rudolf Hess the undersigned
have reached the following conclusions:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. No essential physical deviations from normality were observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. His mental conditions are of a mixed type. He is an unstable
person, which in technical terms is called a psychopathic
personality. The data concerning his illness during the period of
the last four years submitted by one of us who had him under
observation in England, show that he had a delusion of being
poisoned and other similar paranoic notions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Partly as a reaction to the failure of his mission there, the abnormal
manifestations increased and led to attempts at suicide.
In addition to the above-mentioned he has noticeable hysterical
tendencies which caused a development of various symptoms,
primarily, of amnesia that lasted from November 1943 to June of
1944 and resisted all attempts to be cured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The amnesia symptom may disappear with changing circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second period of amnesia started in February of 1945 and
has lasted up through the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. At present he is not insane in the strict sense of the word.
His amnesia does not prevent him completely from understanding
what is going on around him but it will interfere with his ability
to conduct his defense and to understand details of the past which
would appear as factual data.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. To clarify the situation we recommend that a narco-analysis
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
be performed on him and, if the Court decides to submit him to
trial, the problem should be subsequently reexamined again from
a psychiatric point of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conclusion reached on November 14 by the physicians of
the British Delegation, Lord Moran, Dr. T. Rees and Dr. G. Riddoch,
and the physicians of the Soviet Delegation, Professors
Krasnushkin, Sepp, and Kurshakov, was also arrived at on November
15 by the representative of the French Delegation, Professor
Jean Delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an examination of Mr. Hess which took place on November
15, 1945, the undersigned Professors and experts of the
Soviet Delegation, Krasnushkin, Sepp and Kurshakov, and Professor
Jean Delay, the expert from the French Delegation, have
agreed on the following statement:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hess categorically refused to be submitted to narco-analysis
and resisted all other procedures intended to effect a cure of his
amnesia, and stated that he would agree to undergo treatment
only after the trial. The behavior of Mr. Hess makes it impossible
to apply the methods suggested in Paragraph 4 of the report of
November 14 and to follow the suggestion of that Paragraph in
present form.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) Record of Examination of Rudolf Hess</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the information obtained on Nov. 16, 1945, during
the interrogation of Rosenberg who had seen Hess immediately
before the latter’s flight to England, Hess gave no evidence of
any abnormality either in appearance or conversation. He was,
as usual, quiet and composed. Nor was it apparent that he might
have been nervous. Prior to this, he was a calm person, habitually
suffering pains in the region of the stomach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As can be judged on the basis of the report of the English
psychiatrist, Doctor Rees, who had Hess under observation from
the first days of his flight to England, Hess, after the airplane
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
crash, disclosed no evidence of a brain injury, but, upon arrest
and incarceration, he began to give expression to ideas of persecution.
He feared that he would be poisoned, or killed and his
death represented as a suicide, and that all this would be done
by the English under the hypnotic influence of the Jews. Furthermore,
these delusions of persecution were maintained up to the
news of the catastrophe suffered by the German Army at Stalingrad
when the manifestations were replaced by amnesia. According
to Doctor Rees, the delusions of persecution and the amnesia
were observed not to take place simultaneously. Furthermore,
there were two attempts at suicide. A knife wound, inflicted
during the second attempt, in the skin near the heart gave
evidence of a clearly hysterico-demonstrative character. After
this there was again observed a change from amnesia to delusions
of persecution, and during this period he wrote that he
was simulating his amnesia, and, finally, again entered into a
state of amnesia which has been prolonged up to the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the examination of Rudolf Hess on Nov. 14, 1945,
the following was disclosed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess complains of frequent cramping pains in the region of
the stomach which appear independent of the taking of food,
and headaches in the frontal lobes during mental strain, and,
finally, of loss of memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In general his condition is marked by a pallor of the skin and
a noticeable reduction in food intake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regarding the internal organs of Hess, the pulse is 92, and a
shakening of the heart tone is noticeable. There has been no
change in the condition of the other internal organs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the neurological aspect, there are no symptoms of
organic impairment of the nervous system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Psychologically, Hess is in a state of clear consciousness;
knows that he is in prison at Nurnberg under indictment as a
war criminal; has read, and, according to his own words, is
acquainted with the charges against him. He answers questions
rapidly and to the point. His speech is coherent, his thoughts
formed with precision and correctness and they are accompanied
by sufficient emotionally expressive movements. Also, there is
no kind of evidence of paralogism. It should also be noted here,
that the present psychological examination, which was conducted
by Lieut. Gilbert, M.D., bears out the testimony that the intelligence
of Hess is normal and in some instances above the average.
His movements are natural and not forced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has expressed no delirious fancies nor does he give any
delirious explanation for the painful sensation in his stomach or
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
the loss of memory, as was previously attested to by Doctor Rees,
namely, when Hess ascribed them to poisoning. At the present
time, to the question about the reason for his painful sensations
and the loss of memory, Hess answers that this is for the doctors
to know. According to his own assertions, he can remember almost
nothing of his former life. The gaps in Hess’ memory are
ascertained only on the basis of the subjective changing of his
testimony about his inability to remember this or that person or
event given at different times. What he knows at the present
time is, in his own words, what he allegedly learned only recently
from the information of those around him and the films which
have been shown him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Nov. 14 Hess refused the injection of narcotics which were
offered for the purpose of making an analysis of his psychological
condition. On Nov. 15, in answer to Prof. Delay’s offer, he
definitely and firmly refused narcosis and explained to him that,
in general, he would take all measures to cure his amnesia only
upon completion of the trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that has been exposed above, we are convinced, permits, of
the interpretation that the deviation from the norm in the behavior
of Hess takes the following forms:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I. In the psychological personality of Hess there are no changes
typical of the progressive schizophrenic disease, and therefore
the delusions, from which he suffered periodically while in
England, cannot be considered as manifestations of a schizophrenic
paranoia, and must be recognized as the expression of a
psychogenic paranoic reaction, that is, the psychologically comprehensible
reaction of an unstable (psychologically) personality
to the situation (the failure of his mission, arrest and incarceration).
Such an interpretation of the delirious statements of Hess
in England is bespoken by their disappearance, appearance and
repeated disappearance depending on external circumstances
which affected the mental state of Hess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>II. The loss of memory of Hess is not the result of some kind
of mental disease but represents hysterical amnesia, the basis of
which is a subconscious inclination toward self-defense as well as
a deliberate and conscious tendency toward it. Such behavior
often terminates when the hysterical person is faced with an
unavoidable necessity of conducting himself correctly. Therefore,
the amnesia of Hess may end upon his being brought to
trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>III. Rudolf Hess, prior to his flight to England, did not suffer
from any kind of insanity, nor is he now suffering from it. At
the present time he exhibits hysterical behavior with signs of a
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
conscious-intentional (simulated) character, which does not exonerate
him from his responsibility under the indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Material objections are being raised by the Defense, inasmuch
as the expert opinion denies the competence of the defendant
as a consequence of a mental disorder.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>II</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the proceedings, I, as Counsel for the Defendant Hess,
wish to make the following statement:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. <span class='it'>I move</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>a.</span> That a decision be made to adjourn the proceedings against

Even if the amnesia does not keep him from understanding
what happens about him or to understand the course of
the trial, this amnesia nevertheless has a disturbing effect on his
defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The impairment of the defendant in his defense, through his
amnesia, recognized by all opinions as a mental defect, has to
be acknowledged as such, in view of the statements in the opinions
of the Soviet, English and American Delegations of 14 November
1945, which designate the mental condition as one of a
mixed kind, but more as one of a sort of mental abnormality.
This will not make a pertinent defense possible for him (Hess).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this respect, it does not have to be considered that the defendant
is not mentally ill “in the literal meaning of the word”
and that he can follow the proceedings. The question whether
the defendant is at present incapable, as a result of the diminution
of his “mental powers,” to understand all occurrences and
to defend himself properly, has nothing to do with his mental
derangement when committing the crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the opinion of counsel, the defendant is in no case in a position
to make himself understood or to understand argument, because
he is impaired in his mental clarity through the loss of his
memory and because he has completely lost the knowledge of
previous events and of people of former acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the expert establishment of his mental disorder which
impairs the defendant in the full execution of his defense, makes
proceedings against him inadmissible, the statement of the defendant
that he thinks himself capable of being tried has no
significance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to expert opinion, the impairment of the defendant
cannot be removed within a measurable space of time. It is not
sure whether treatment through Narco-Analysis, as proposed by
the medical experts, will have the desired result. The defendant
has refused to submit to this treatment only because he thinks
of himself as capable of being tried and consequently not in need
of such treatment. Furthermore, because he is opposed to any
forcible influence upon the body, and finally, he is afraid of physical
disturbances which would prevent him from participating
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
in the trial if such method of treatment is used at this time. The
proceedings would have to be dropped in case of an illness of
long duration which excludes his fitness to be tried.</p>

<p class='noindent'>he, the defendant, cannot be located or if the Tribunal thinks it
necessary, for other reasons, in the interests of justice. If the
Tribunal, on the basis of convincing expert opinions, establishes
that the defendant is not in a position to put up a pertinent defense
and consequently decides not to proceed against him, proceedings
in absentia, according to Article 12, could then only be
carried on if this is in the interest of justice. It would not be
compatible with objective justice, in case that actual proof of this
fact is available, if the defendant is impeded by an impairment
based upon health reasons, in personally standing up for his
rights and in being present at the trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In proceedings which accuse the defendant of such serious
crimes and possibly carry the death penalty, it would not be compatible
with objective justice if he were personally denied the
opportunity to look after his rights as stated in Article 16 of the
Statutes. These rights provide for his self-defense. The possibility
to “personally present evidence for one’s defense and to
cross-examine each witness of the prosecution” is of such importance
that any exclusion of such rights has to be considered
an injustice toward the defendant. Proceedings in absentia can,
under no circumstances, be accepted as a “fair trial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same is true for the exclusion of the defendant from the
rights which are granted him during the proceedings according
to Article 24.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the defendant is impaired in his ability to defend himself
for the reasons of the expert opinions, and to the extent explained
therein, then he is just as little in a position to give his
Counsel the necessary information and to enable him to take
care of the defense in his absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the Statutes establish the rights for the defense in this
precise manner, it does not seem fair to withhold these from a
defendant in a case when he is prevented from personally taking
care of his defense during the proceedings. The rules in Article
12, regarding the proceedings against an absent defendant, have
to be considered as an exception which should only be used
against a defendant who tries to dodge in spite of his being in a
position to be tried. The Defendant Hess has always been prepared
to be tried in order to avoid proceedings in absentia, which
he considers an injustice of the highest measure.

<p class='noindent'>opinion in the sense of the defense, and therefore come to a denial
of the Application ad a, it seems necessary to obtain the super
opinion because the opinions testify to the fact that the defendant
is a psychopathic personality who suffers from hallucinations
and still today shows, in the loss of memory, clear signs of a
serious hysteria. If the Tribunal does not consider these sentiments
alone as sufficient for the establishment of incapability to
be tried, a more intensive examination would have to follow
which would not be confined to an examination of only one or
two hours on several days, but require a clinical observation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opinions, themselves, provide for another examination
of the mental condition of the defendant, which seems to prove
that the experts possibly have a “disturbance of the mental capacity”
in mind if the condition of the defendant lasts and the
Tribunal, against expectations, declares the defendant unfit to
be tried and therewith incompetent under all circumstances.</p>

<p class='noindent'>TO THE INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States respectfully files the following observations
on the application of RUDOLF HESS:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess’ condition was known to the undersigned representative of
the United States immediately after his delivery to the Nurnberg
prison and was the subject of a report by Major Douglas McG.
Kelley of the Medical Corps of the United States Army, which report
is attached hereto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report of Major Kelley and his recommendation for treatment
were submitted to me and on October 20, 1945, I advised
that “any treatment of this case involving the use of drugs which
might cause injury to the subject is disapproved.” This was not
because I disapproved of the treatment. I approve of the treatment
and would insist on its being employed if the victim were a
member of my own family. But I was of the opinion that the
private administration of any kind of drug to Hess would be dangerous
because if he should thereafter die, even of natural causes,
it would become the subject of public controversy. This completely
agreed with the opinion of the Security Officer, Colonel B. C. Andrus,
whose report is attached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the statements contained in the medical report of
the Commission and in view of the facts which I have recited, the
United States must regard Hess as a victim, at most, of a voluntary
amnesia and presenting no case for excuse from trial.</p>

<p class='line'>SUBJECT: Psychiatric Status of Internee.</p>
<p class='line'>TO: Commanding Officer, Internal Security Detachment.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. Internee Rudolf HESS has been carefully studied since his
admission to Nurnberg Prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. On entry HESS manifested a spotty amnesia. The British
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
psychiatrist accompanying him stated that from 4 October 43
to 4 February 45 HESS presented symptoms of total amnesia.
From 4 February 45 to 12 July 45 he recovered, and is said to
have made a statement that his previous amnesia was simulated.
On 12 July 45 he again developed amnesia which has lasted to the
present. Also while in England HESS claimed he was being
poisoned and sealed up numerous samples of food, chocolate, medicine,
etc. as “evidence” to be analyzed prior to his trials. Such
behavior could be either simulated or a true paranoid reaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Present examination reveals a normal mental status with the
exception of the amnesia. Attitude and general behavior are
normal, mood and affect, while slightly depressed, are intact and
normal. Sensorium is intact and insight is good. Content reveals
vague paranoid trends, but there is no evidence of any actual
psychosis. His reactions to his suspicions are not fixed—and delusioned
trends—are distinctly spotty and disconnected. His reactions
are those of an individual who has given up a simulated
behavior pattern rather than those of the psychotic. Oddly enough
his memory for this phase of behavior is excellent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. Special examinations with Rorschach cards indicate some
neurotic patterns. They point to a highly schizoid personality
with hysterical and obsessive components. Such findings are confirmed
in the patient’s present reactions. He complains bitterly
of “stomach cramps” which are obviously neurotic manifestations.
He is over-dramatic in his actions presenting typical hysterical
gestures, complaints and symptoms. His amnesia is at present
limited to personal events concerning his history after joining the
party. The amnesia however shifts in a highly suspicious fashion.
Such amnesias may be hysterical in nature but in such cases do
not change in depth from day to day and facts recently learned
are not lost as with Hess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. In HESS’ case there is also the factor of his long amnesia in
England. It is quite possible that he has suggested an amnesia
to himself for so long that he partially believes in it. In a person
of hysterical make-up such auto suggestion could readily produce
an amnesic state. Also the “gain” or protection found in amnesia,
fancied or real, would be a bar to its easy clearance. Finally a
large conscious element may well be present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>6. In this case I believe all those factors are present. Treatment
will have to be formulated along lines attacking the suggestive
factors and overcoming conscious restraints. Hypnosis would
be a value but probably chemical hypnosis will be required. Such
narco-hypnosis and analysis require the use of intra venous drugs
of the barbitol series, either sodium amytol or sodium pentothal.
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
Such treatment is in general innocuous if proper precautions are
taken. It must be borne in mind, however, that occasional accidents
happen in any intravenous technique. With the drugs mentioned
above rare fatalities have been reported although in more
than 1000 such cases personally treated, I have never seen one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>7. Essentially the present situation is as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>a.</span> Internee HESS is sane and responsible.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>b.</span> Internee HESS is a profound neurotic of the hysterical type.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>c.</span> His amnesia is of mixed etiology, stemming from auto suggestions
and conscious malingering in a hysterical personality.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>d.</span> Treatment will be required if it is felt desirable to remove
this amnesia.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>e.</span> Such treatment, though it cannot eliminate the conscious
element is of great value in estimating its importance. With such
techniques accurate estimates of malingering can be made. If
this is a true amnesia, total recovery can be predicted.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>f.</span> Such treatment is essentially harmless except in extremely
rare instances. In ordinary practice the value of the treatment
far outweighs any of its hazards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>8. Clarification as to the desired degree of treatment in this
case is requested.</p>

<h4>D. <span class='it'>STATEMENT BY HESS TO THE TRIBUNAL CONCERNING HIS MEMORY</span></h4>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>30 November 1945</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Afternoon Session</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. President: At the beginning of this afternoon’s proceedings,
I handed my defense counsel a note stating that I
am of the opinion that these proceedings could be shortened if
I could speak briefly. What I have to say is as follows: In order
to prevent any possibility of my being declared incapable
of pleading—although I am willing to take part in the rest
of the proceedings with the rest of them, I would like to make
the following declaration to the Tribunal although I originally
intended not to make this declaration until a later time.
My memory is again in order. The reason why I simulated
loss of memory was tactical. In fact, it is only that my power
for concentration is slightly reduced but in conflict to that
my capacity to follow the trial, my capacity to defend myself,
to put questions to witnesses or even to answer questions—in
these, my capacities are not influenced. I emphasize the
fact that I bear full responsibility for everything that I have
done, signed or have signed as co-signatory. My fundamental
attitude that the Tribunal is not legally competent, is not affected
by the statement I have just made. Hitherto, in my
conversations with my official defense counsel, I have maintained
my loss of memory. He was, therefore, acting in good
faith when he asserted I had lost my memory.”</p>

<h4>E. <span class='it'>RULING OF THE TRIBUNAL</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>The ruling of the International Military Tribunal was announced
orally by Lord Justice Lawrence, presiding, on 1
December 1945:
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tribunal has given careful consideration to the motion
of Counsel for the Defendant Hess, and it has had the
advantage of hearing full argument upon it both from the
Defense and from the Prosecution. The Tribunal has also
considered the very full medical reports, which have been
made on the condition of the Defendant Hess, and has come
to the conclusion that no grounds whatever exist for a further
examination to be ordered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After hearing the statement of the Defendant Hess in
court yesterday, and in view of all the evidence, the Tribunal
is of the opinion that the Defendant Hess is capable of standing
his trial at the present time, and the motion of Counsel
for the Defense is, therefore, denied, and the trial will proceed.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span><h1>Chapter V<br/> OPENING ADDRESS FOR THE UNITED STATES</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The following address, opening the American case under Count
I of the Indictment, was delivered by Justice Robert H. Jackson,
Chief of Counsel for the United States, before the Tribunal on 21
November 1945:</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>May it please Your Honors,</p>

<p class='pindent'>The privilege of opening the first trial in history for crimes
against the peace of the world imposes a grave responsibility.
The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so
calculated, so malignant and so devastating, that civilization cannot
tolerate their being ignored because it cannot survive their
being repeated. That four great nations, flushed with victory
and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily
submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one
of the most significant tributes that Power ever has paid to Reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This tribunal, while it is novel and experimental, is not the
product of abstract speculations nor is it created to vindicate legalistic
theories. This inquest represents the practical effort of
four of the most mighty of nations, with the support of seventeen
more, to utilize International Law to meet the greatest menace of
our times—aggressive war. The common sense of mankind demands
that law shall not stop with the punishment of petty
crimes by little people. It must also reach men who possess themselves
of great power and make deliberate and concerted use of it
to set in motion evils which leave no home in the world untouched.
It is a cause of this magnitude that the United Nations will lay
before Your Honors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the prisoners’ dock sit twenty-odd broken men. Reproached
by the humiliation of those they have led almost as bitterly as by
the desolation of those they have attacked, their personal capacity
for evil is forever past. It is hard now to perceive in these miserable
men as captives the power by which as Nazi leaders they
once dominated much of the world and terrified most of it. Merely
as individuals, their fate is of little consequence to the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What makes this inquest significant is that those prisoners represent
sinister influence that will lurk in the world long after their
bodies have returned to dust. They are living symbols of racial
hatreds, of terrorism and violence, and of the arrogance and cruelty
of power. They are symbols of fierce nationalisms and militarism,
of intrigue and war-making which have embroiled Europe
generation after generation, crushing its manhood, destroying its
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
homes, and impoverishing its life. They have so identified themselves
with the philosophies they conceived and with the forces
they directed that any tenderness to them is a victory and an encouragement
to all the evils which are attached to their names.
Civilization can afford no compromise with the social forces which
would gain renewed strength if we deal ambiguously or indecisively
with the men in whom those forces now precariously survive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What these men stand for we will patiently and temperately
disclose. We will give you undeniable proofs of incredible events.
The catalogue of crimes will omit nothing that could be conceived
by a pathological pride, cruelty, and lust for power. These men
created in Germany, under the <span class='it'>Fuehrerprinzip</span>, a National Socialist
despotism equalled only by the dynasties of the ancient East.
They took from the German people all those dignities and freedoms
that we hold natural and inalienable rights in every human
being. The people were compensated by inflaming and gratifying
hatreds toward those who were marked as “scape-goats.” Against
their opponents, including Jews, Catholics, and free labor the
Nazis directed such a campaign of arrogance, brutality, and annihilation
as the world has not witnessed since the pre-Christian
ages. They excited the German ambition to be a “master race,”
which of course implies serfdom for others. They led their people
on a mad gamble for domination. They diverted social energies
and resources to the creation of what they thought to be an invincible
war machine. They overran their neighbors. To sustain
the “master race” in its war-making, they enslaved millions of
human beings and brought them into Germany, where these hapless
creatures now wander as “displaced persons”. At length bestiality
and bad faith reached such excess that they aroused the
sleeping strength of imperiled civilization. Its united efforts have
ground the German war machine to fragments. But the struggle
has left Europe a liberated yet prostrate land where a demoralized
society struggles to survive. These are the fruits of the sinister
forces that sit with these defendants in the prisoners’ dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In justice to the nations and the men associated in this prosecution,
I must remind you of certain difficulties which may leave
their mark on this case. Never before in legal history has an effort
been made to bring within the scope of a single litigation the
developments of a decade, covering a whole Continent, and involving
a score of nations, countless individuals, and innumerable
events. Despite the magnitude of the task, the world has demanded
immediate action. This demand has had to be met, though
perhaps at the cost of finished craftsmanship. In my country,
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
established courts, following familiar procedures, applying well
thumbed precedents, and dealing with the legal consequences of
local and limited events seldom commence a trial within a year of
the event in litigation. Yet less than eight months ago today the
courtroom in which you sit was an enemy fortress in the hands
of German SS troops. Less than eight months ago nearly all our
witnesses and documents were in enemy hands. The law had not
been codified, no procedure had been established, no Tribunal was
in existence, no usable courthouse stood here, none of the hundreds
of tons of official German documents had been examined,
no prosecuting staff had been assembled, nearly all the present
defendants were at large, and the four prosecuting powers had
not yet joined in common cause to try them. I should be the last
to deny that the case may well suffer from incomplete researches
and quite likely will not be the example of professional work
which any of the prosecuting nations would normally wish to
sponsor. It is, however, a completely adequate case to the judgment
we shall ask you to render, and its full development we shall
be obliged to leave to historians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before I discuss particulars of evidence, some general considerations
which may affect the credit of this trial in the eyes of
the world should be candidly faced. There is a dramatic disparity
between the circumstances of the accusers and of the accused that
might discredit our work if we should falter, in even minor matters,
in being fair and temperate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, the nature of these crimes is such that both
prosecution and judgment must be by victor nations over vanquished
foes. The worldwide scope of the aggressions carried out
by these men has left but few real neutrals. Either the victors
must judge the vanquished or we must leave the defeated to judge
themselves. After the First World War, we learned the futility
of the latter course. The former high station of these defendants,
the notoriety of their acts, and the adaptability of their conduct
to provoke retaliation make it hard to distinguish between the demand
for a just and measured retribution, and the unthinking
cry for vengeance which arises from the anguish of war. It is
our task, so far as humanly possible, to draw the line between the
two. We must never forget that the record on which we judge
these defendants today is the record on which history will judge
us tomorrow. To pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to
put it to our own lips as well. We must summon such detachment
and intellectual integrity to our task that this trial will commend
itself to posterity as fulfilling humanity’s aspirations to do justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the very outset, let us dispose of the contention that to put
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
these men to trial is to do them an injustice entitling them to
some special consideration. These defendants may be hard pressed
but they are not ill used. Let us see what alternative they would
have to being tried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than a majority of these prisoners surrendered to or were
tracked down by forces of the United States. Could they expect
us to make American custody a shelter for our enemies against
the just wrath of our Allies? Did we spend American lives to capture
them only to save them from punishment? Under the principles
of the Moscow Declaration, those suspected war criminals
who are not to be tried internationally must be turned over to individual
governments for trial at the scene of their outrages.
Many less responsible and less culpable American-held prisoners
have been and will be turned over to other United Nations for local
trial. If these defendants should succeed, for any reason, in
escaping the condemnation of this Tribunal, or if they obstruct
or abort this trial, those who are American-held prisoners will be
delivered up to our continental Allies. For these defendants, however,
we have set up an International Tribunal and have undertaken
the burden of participating in a complicated effort to give
them fair and dispassionate hearings. That is the best known
protection to any man with a defense worthy of being heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If these men are the first war leaders of a defeated nation to be
prosecuted in the name of the law, they are also the first to be
given a chance to plead for their lives in the name of the law.
Realistically, the Charter of this Tribunal, which gives them a
hearing, is also the source of their only hope. It may be that
these men of troubled conscience, whose only wish is that the
world forget them, do not regard a trial as a favor. But they do
have a fair opportunity to defend themselves—a favor which
these men, when in power, rarely extended to their fellow countrymen.
Despite the fact that public opinion already condemns
their acts, we agree that here they must be given a presumption
of innocence, and we accept the burden of proving criminal acts
and the responsibility of these defendants for their commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I say that we do not ask for convictions unless we prove
crime, I do not mean mere technical or incidental transgression
of international conventions. We charge guilt on planned and intended
conduct that involves moral as well as legal wrong. And
we do not mean conduct that is a natural and human, even if illegal,
cutting of corners, such as many of us might well have committed
had we been in the defendants’ positions. It is not because
they yielded to the normal frailties of human beings that we accuse
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
them. It is their abnormal and inhuman conduct which brings
them to this bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will not ask you to convict these men on the testimony of
their foes. There is no count of the Indictment that cannot be
proved by books and records. The Germans were always meticulous
record keepers, and these defendants had their share of the
Teutonic passion for thoroughness in putting things on paper.
Nor were they without vanity. They arranged frequently to be
photographed in action. We will show you their own films. You
will see their own conduct and hear their own voices as these defendants
reenact for you, from the screen, some of the events in
the course of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We would also make clear that we have no purpose to incriminate
the whole German people. We know that the Nazi Party
was not put in power by a majority of the German vote. We
know it came to power by an evil alliance between the most extreme
of the Nazi revolutionists, the most unrestrained of the
German reactionaries, and the most aggressive of the German
militarists. If the German populace had willingly accepted the
Nazi program, no Stormtroopers would have been needed in the
early days of the Party and there would have been no need for
concentration camps or the Gestapo, both of which institutions
were inaugurated as soon as the Nazis gained control of the
German state. Only after these lawless innovations proved successful
at home were they taken abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German people should know by now that the people of the
United States hold them in no fear, and in no hate. It is true
that the Germans have taught us the horrors of modern warfare,
but the ruin that lies from the Rhine to the Danube shows that
we, like our Allies, have not been dull pupils. If we are not awed
by German fortitude and proficiency in war, and if we are not
persuaded of their political maturity, we do respect their skill
in the arts of peace, their technical competence, and the sober,
industrious and self-disciplined character of the masses of the
German people. In 1933, we saw the German people recovering
prestige in the commercial, industrial and artistic world after the
set-back of the last war. We beheld their progress neither with
envy nor malice. The Nazi regime interrupted this advance. The
recoil of the Nazi aggression has left Germany in ruins. The Nazi
readiness to pledge the German word without hesitation and to
break it without shame has fastened upon German diplomacy a
reputation for duplicity that will handicap it for years. Nazi
arrogance has made the boast of the “master race” a taunt that
will be thrown at Germans the world over for generations. The
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
Nazi nightmare has given the German name a new and sinister
significance throughout the world which will retard Germany a
century. The German, no less than the non-German world, has
accounts to settle with these defendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact of the war and the course of the war, which is the
central theme of our case, is history. From September 1st, 1939,
when the German armies crossed the Polish frontiers, until September,
1942, when they met epic resistance at Stalingrad, German
arms seemed invincible. Denmark and Norway, The Netherlands
and France, Belgium and Luxembourg, the Balkans and
Africa, Poland and the Baltic States, and parts of Russia, all
had been overrun and conquered by swift, powerful, well-aimed
blows. That attack upon the peace of the world is the crime
against international society which brings into international cognizance
crimes in its aid and preparation which otherwise might
be only internal concerns. It was aggressive war, which the nations
of the world had renounced. It was war in violation of
treaties, by which the peace of the world was sought to be safeguarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This war did not just happen—it was planned and prepared for
over a long period of time and with no small skill and cunning.
The world has perhaps never seen such a concentration and stimulation
of the energies of any people as that which enabled Germany
twenty years after it was defeated, disarmed, and dismembered
to come so near carrying out its plan to dominate Europe.
Whatever else we may say of those who were the authors of this
war, they did achieve a stupendous work in organization, and
our first task is to examine the means by which these defendants
and their fellow conspirators prepared and incited Germany to
go to war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In general, our case will disclose these defendants all uniting
at some time with the Nazi Party in a plan which they well knew
could be accomplished only by an outbreak of war in Europe.
Their seizure of the German state, their subjugation of the
German people, their terrorism and extermination of dissident
elements, their planning and waging of war, their calculated and
planned ruthlessness in the conduct of warfare, their deliberate
and planned criminality toward conquered peoples, all these are
ends for which they acted in concert; and all these are phases of
the conspiracy, a conspiracy which reached one goal only to set
out for another and more ambitious one. We shall also trace
for you the intricate web of organizations which these men
formed and utilized to accomplish these ends. We will show how
the entire structure of offices and officials was dedicated to the
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
criminal purposes and committed to use of the criminal methods
planned by these defendants and their co-conspirators, many of
whom war and suicide have put beyond reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is my purpose to open the case, particularly under Count
One of the Indictment, and to deal with the common plan or conspiracy
to achieve ends possible only by resort to crimes against
peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. My emphasis
will not be on individual barbarities and perversions which may
have occurred independently of any central plan. One of the
dangers ever-present is that this trial may be protracted by details
of particular wrongs and that we will become lost in a
“wilderness of single instances.” Nor will I now dwell on the
activity of individual defendants except as it may contribute to
exposition of the common plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The case as presented by the United States will be concerned
with the brains and authority back of all the crimes. These defendants
were men of a station and rank which does not soil its
own hands with blood. They were men who knew how to use
lesser folk as tools. We want to reach the planners and designers,
the inciters and leaders without whose evil architecture the world
would not have been for so long scourged with the violence and
lawlessness, and wracked with the agonies and convulsions, of
this terrible war.</p>

<h4>THE LAWLESS ROAD TO POWER</h4>

<p class='pindent'>The chief instrumentality of cohesion in plan and action was
the National Socialist German Workers Party, known as the Nazi
Party. Some of the defendants were with it from the beginning.
Others joined only after success seemed to have validated its
lawlessness or power had invested it with immunity from the
processes of the law. Adolf Hitler became its supreme leader or
<span class='it'>fuehrer</span> in 1921.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 24th of February, 1920, at Munich, it publicly had proclaimed
its program (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>). Some of its purposes would
commend themselves to many good citizens, such as the demands
for “profit-sharing in the great industries,” “generous development
of provision for old age,” “creation and maintenance of a
healthy middle class,” “a land reform suitable to our national
requirements,” and “raising the standard of health.” It also
made a strong appeal to that sort of nationalism which in ourselves
we call patriotism and in our rivals chauvinism. It demanded
“equality of rights for the German people in its dealing
with other nations and the evolution of the peace treaties of
Versailles and St. Germaine.” It demanded the “union of all
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
Germans on the basis of the right of self-determination of peoples
to form a Great Germany.” It demanded “land and territory
(colonies) for the enrichment of our people and the settlement
of our surplus population.” All these, of course, were legitimate
objectives if they were to be attained without resort to
aggressive warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi Party from its inception, however, contemplated war.
It demanded “the abolition of mercenary troops and the formation
of a national army.” It proclaimed that “In view of the
enormous sacrifice of life and property demanded of a nation by
every war, personal enrichment through war must be regarded
as a crime against the nation. We demand, therefore, the ruthless
confiscation of all war profits.” I do not criticise this policy.
Indeed, I wish it were universal. I merely point out that in a
time of peace, war was a preoccupation of the Party, and it
started the work of making war less offensive to the masses of
the people. With this it combined a program of physical training
and sports for youth that became, as we shall see, the cloak
for a secret program of military training.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi Party declaration also committed its members to an
anti-Semitic program. It declared that no Jew or any person of
non-German blood could be a member of the nation. Such persons
were to be disfranchised, disqualified for office, subject to the
alien laws, and entitled to nourishment only after the German
population had first been provided for. All who had entered
Germany after August 2, 1914 were to be required forthwith to
depart, and all non-German immigration was to be prohibited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Party also avowed, even in those early days, an authoritarian
and totalitarian program for Germany. It demanded
creation of a strong central power with unconditional authority,
nationalization of all businesses which had been “amalgamated,”
and a “reconstruction” of the national system of education which
“must aim at teaching the pupil to understand the idea of the
State (state sociology).” Its hostility to civil liberties and freedom
of the press was distinctly announced in these words: “It
must be forbidden to publish newspapers which do not conduce
to the national welfare. We demand the legal prosecution of
all tendencies in art or literature of a kind likely to disintegrate
our life as a nation and the suppression of institutions which
might militate against the above requirements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The forecast of religious persecution was clothed in the language
of religious liberty, for the Nazi program stated, “We
demand liberty for all religious denominations in the State.” But,
it continues with the limitation, “so far as they are not a danger
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
to it and do not militate against the morality and moral sense of
the German race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Party program foreshadowed the campaign of terrorism.
It announced, “We demand ruthless war upon those whose activities
are injurious to the common interests”, and it demanded
that such offenses be punished with death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is significant that the leaders of this Party interpreted this
program as a belligerent one certain to precipitate conflict. The
Party platform concluded, “The leaders of the Party swear to
proceed regardless of consequences—if necessary, at the sacrifice
of their lives—toward the fulfillment of the foregoing points.” It
is this Leadership Corps of the Party, not its entire membership,
that stands accused as a criminal organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us now see how the leaders of the Party fulfilled their
pledge to proceed regardless of consequences. Obviously, their
foreign objectives, which were nothing less than to undo international
treaties and to wrest territory from foreign control, as
well as most of their internal program, could be accomplished
only by possession of the machinery of the German State. The
first effort, accordingly, was to subvert the Weimar Republic
by violent revolution. An abortive putsch at Munich in 1923
landed many of them in jail. The period of meditation which
followed produced <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, henceforth the source of law for
the Party workers and a source of considerable revenue to its
supreme leader. The Nazi plans for the violent overthrow of
the feeble Republic then turned to plans for its capture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No greater mistake could be made than to think of the Nazi
Party in terms of the loose organizations which we of the
western world call “political parties.” In discipline, structure,
and method the Nazi Party was not adapted to the democratic
process of persuasion. It was an instrument of conspiracy and
of coercion. The Party was not organized to take over power in
the German State by winning support of a majority of the German
people. It was organized to seize power in defiance of the
will of the people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi Party, under the <span class='it'>Fuehrerprinzip</span>, was bound by an
iron discipline into a pyramid, with the Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler,
at the top and broadening into a numerous Leadership Corps,
composed of overlords of a very extensive Party membership at
the base. By no means all of those who may have supported the
movement in one way or another were actual Party members.
The membership took the Party oath which in effect, amounted
to an abdication of personal intelligence and moral responsibility.
This was the oath: “I vow inviolable fidelity to Adolf Hitler; I
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
vow absolute obedience to him and to the leaders he designates
for me.” The membership in daily practice followed its leaders
with an idolatry and self-surrender more Oriental than Western.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will not be obliged to guess as to the motives or goal of
the Nazi Party. The immediate aim was to undermine the
Weimar Republic. The order to all Party members to work to
that end was given in a letter from Hitler of August 24, 1931 to
Rosenberg, of which we will produce the original. Hitler wrote,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“I am just reading in the VOELKISCHER BEOBACHTER,
edition 235/236, page 1, an article entitled “Does
Wirth intend to come over?” The tendency of the article is
to prevent on our part a crumbling away from the present
form of government. I myself am travelling all over Germany
to achieve exactly the opposite. May I therefore ask
that my own paper will not stab me in the back with tactically
unwise articles * * *” (<span class='it'>047-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Captured film enables us to present the defendant, Alfred Rosenberg,
who from the screen will himself tell you the story. The
SA practiced violent interference with elections. We have the
reports of the SD describing in detail how its members later
violated the secrecy of elections in order to identify those who
opposed them. One of the reports makes this explanation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“The control was effected in the following way: some
members of the election-committee marked all the ballot
papers with numbers. During the ballot itself, a voters’
list was made up. The ballot-papers were handed out in
numerical order, therefore it was possible afterwards with
the aid of this list to find out the persons who cast no-votes
or invalid votes. One sample of these marked ballot-papers
is enclosed. The marking was done on the back of the ballot-papers
with skimmed milk * * *” (<span class='it'>R-142</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Party activity, in addition to all the familiar forms of
political contest, took on the aspect of a rehearsal for warfare.
It utilized a Party formation, <span class='it'>DIE STURMABTEILUNGEN</span>,
commonly known as the SA. This was a voluntary organization
of youthful and fanatical Nazis trained for the use of violence
under semi-military discipline. Its members began by acting as
bodyguards for the Nazi leaders and rapidly expanded from defensive
to offensive tactics. They became disciplined ruffians for
the breaking up of opposition meetings and the terrorization of
adversaries. They boasted that their task was to make the Nazi
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
Party “master of the streets.” The SA was the parent organization
of a number of others. Its offspring include <span class='it'>DIE SCHUTZSTAFFELN</span>,
commonly known as the SS, formed in 1925 and
distinguished for the fanaticism and cruelty of its members; <span class='it'>DER
SICHERHEITSDIENST</span>, known as the SD; and <span class='it'>DIE GEHEIME
STAATSPOLIZEI</span>, the Secret State Police, the infamous Gestapo
formed in 1934 after Nazi accession to power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A glance at a chart of the Party organization (<span class='it'>Chart No. 1</span>) is
enough to show how completely it differed from the political parties
we know. It had its own source of law in the fuehrer and
sub-fuehrers. It had its own courts and its own police. The conspirators
set up a government within the Party to exercise outside
the law every sanction that any legitimate state could exercise
and many that it could not. Its chain of command was military,
and its formations were martial in name as well as in function.
They were composed of battalions set up to bear arms under military
discipline, motorized corps, flying corps, and the infamous
“Death Head Corps”, which was not misnamed. The Party had
its own secret police, its security units, its intelligence and espionage
division, its raiding forces, and its youth forces. It established
elaborate administrative mechanisms to identify and liquidate
spies and informers, to manage concentration camps, to operate
death vans, and to finance the whole movement. Through concentric
circles of authority, the Nazi Party, as its leadership
later boasted, eventually organized and dominated every phase
of German life—but not until they had waged a bitter internal
struggle characterized by brutal criminality. In preparation for
this phase of their struggle, they created a party police system.
This became the pattern and the instrument of the police state,
which was the first goal in their plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Party formations, including the Leadership Corps of the
Party, the SD, the SS, the SA and the infamous Secret State
Police, or Gestapo—all these stand accused before you as criminal
organizations; organizations which, as we will prove from their
own documents, were recruited only from recklessly devoted
Nazis, ready in conviction and temperament to do the most violent
of deeds to advance the common program. They terrorized and
silenced democratic opposition and were able at length to combine
with political opportunists, militarists, industrialists, monarchists,
and political reactionaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On January 30, 1933 Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of the German
Republic. An evil combination, represented in the prisoners’
dock, by its most eminent survivors, had succeeded in possessing
itself of the machinery of the German Government, a facade behind
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
which they thenceforth would operate to make a reality of
the war of conquest they so long had plotted. The conspiracy had
passed into its second phase.</p>

<h4>THE CONSOLIDATION OF NAZI POWER</h4>

<p class='pindent'>We shall now consider the steps, which embraced the most hideous
of crimes against humanity, to which the conspirators resorted
in perfecting control of the German State and in preparing Germany
for the aggressive war indispensable to their ends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans of the 1920’s were a frustrated and baffled people
as a result of defeat and the disintegration of their traditional
government. The democratic elements, which were trying to
govern Germany through the new and feeble machinery of the
Weimar Republic, got inadequate support from the democratic
forces of the rest of the world. It is not to be denied that Germany,
when worldwide depression was added to her other problems,
was faced with urgent and intricate pressure in her economic
and political life which necessitated bold measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The internal measures by which a nation attempts to solve its
problems are ordinarily of no concern to other nations. But the
Nazi program from the first was recognized as a desperate program
for a people still suffering the effects of an unsuccessful
war. The Nazi policy embraced ends always recognized as attainable
only by a renewal and a more successful outcome of war.
The conspirators’ answer to Germany’s problems was nothing
less than to plot the regaining of territories lost in the First
World War and the acquisition of other fertile lands of Central
Europe by dispossessing or exterminating those who inhabited
them. They also contemplated destroying or permanently weakening
all other neighboring peoples so as to win virtual domination
of Europe and probably of the world. The precise limits of
their ambition we need not define for it was and is as illegal to
wage aggressive war for small stakes as for large ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We find at this period two governments in Germany—the real
and the ostensible. The forms of the German Republic were
maintained for a time, and it was the outward and visible government.
But the real authority in the State was outside of and
above the law and rested in the Leadership Corps of the Nazi
Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On February 27, 1933, less than a month after Hitler became
Chancellor, the Reichstag building was set on fire. The burning
of this symbol of free parliamentary government was so providential
for the Nazis that it was believed they staged the fire
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
themselves. Certainly when we contemplate their known crimes,
we cannot believe they would shrink from mere arson. It is not
necessary, however, to resolve the controversy as to who set the
fire. The significant point is in the use that was made of the fire
and of the state of public mind it produced. The Nazis immediately
accused the Communist Party of instigating and committing
the crime, and turned every effort to portray this single act
of arson as the beginning of a Communist revolution. Then,
taking advantage of the hysteria, the Nazi met this phantom
revolution with a real one. In the following December, the German
Supreme Court with commendable courage and independence
acquitted the accused Communists, but it was too late to influence
the tragic course of events which the Nazi conspirators had set
rushing forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler, on the morning after the fire, obtained from the aged
and ailing President von Hindenburg a Presidential decree suspending
the extensive guarantees of individual liberty contained
in the Constitution of the Weimar Republic. The decree provided
that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Sections 114, 115, 117, 118, 123, 124 and 153 of the Constitution
of the German Reich are suspended until further
notice. Thus, restrictions on personal liberty, on the right
of free expression of opinion, including freedom of the press,
on the right of assembly and the right of association, and
violations of the privacy of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic
communications, and warrants for house-searches,
orders for confiscations as well as restrictions on property,
are also permissible beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed.”
(<span class='it'>1390-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The extent of the restriction on personal liberty under the decree
of February 28, 1933 may be understood by reference to the
rights under the Weimar Constitution which were suspended:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Article 114.</span> The freedom of the person is inviolable.
Curtailment or deprivation of personal freedom by a public
authority is only permissible on a legal basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Persons who have been deprived of their freedom must
be informed at the latest on the following day by whose
authority and for what reasons the deprivation of freedom
was ordered; opportunity shall be afforded them without delay
of submitting objections to their deprivation of freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Article 115.</span> Every German’s home is his sanctuary and
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
inviolable. Exceptions may only be made as provided by law.</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Article 117.</span> The secrecy of letters and all postal, telegraphic
and telephone communications is inviolable. Exceptions
are inadmissible except by Reich law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Article 118.</span> Every German has the right, within the
limits of the general laws, to express his opinions freely in
speech, in writing, in print, in picture form or in any other

from this right and no disadvantage may accrue to him from
any person for making use of this right. * * *</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Reich law may make previous notification obligatory

<p class='pindent'>“Property carries obligations. Its use shall also serve the
common good.” (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It must be said in fairness to von Hindenburg that the Constitution
itself authorized him temporarily to suspend these fundamental
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
rights “if the public safety and order in the German
Reich are considerably disturbed or endangered.” It must also
be acknowledged that President Ebert previously had invoked
this power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the National Socialist coup was made possible because the
terms of the Hitler-Hindenburg decree departed from all previous
ones in which the power of suspension had been invoked. Whenever
Ebert had suspended constitutional guarantees of individual
rights, his decree had expressly revived the Protective Custody
Act adopted by the Reichstag in 1916 during the previous war.
This Act guaranteed a judicial hearing within 24 hours of arrest,
gave a right to have counsel and to inspect all relevant records,
provided for appeal, and authorized compensation from Treasury
funds for erroneous arrests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hitler-Hindenburg decree of February 28, 1933 contained
no such safeguards. The omission may not have been noted by
von Hindenburg. Certainly he did not appreciate its effect. It
left the Nazi police and party formations, already existing and
functioning under Hitler, completely unrestrained and irresponsible.
Secret arrest and indefinite detention, without charges,
without evidence, without hearing, without counsel, became the
method of inflicting inhuman punishment on any whom the Nazi
police suspected or disliked. No court could issue an injunction,
or writ of <span class='it'>habeas corpus</span>, or <span class='it'>certiorari</span>. The German people were
in the hands of the police, the police were in the hands of the Nazi
Party, and the Party was in the hands of a ring of evil men, of
whom the defendants here before you are surviving and representative
leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspiracy, as we shall show, always contemplated not
merely overcoming current opposition but exterminating elements
which could not be reconciled with its philosophy of the
state. It not only sought to establish the Nazi “new order” but
to secure its sway, as Hitler predicted, “for a thousand years.”
Nazis were never in doubt or disagreement as to what these dissident
elements were. They were concisely described by one of
them, Col. General von Fritsch, on December 11, 1938, in these
words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Shortly after the first war I came to the conclusion that
we should have to be victorious in three battles if Germany
were to become powerful again: 1. The battle against the
working class—Hitler has won this. 2. Against the Catholic
Church, perhaps better expressed against Ultramontanism.
3. Against the Jews.” (<span class='it'>1947-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The warfare against these elements was continuous. The battle
in Germany was but a practice skirmish for the worldwide
drive against them. We have in point of geography and of time
two groups of crimes against humanity—one within Germany before
and during the war, the other in occupied territory during
the war. But the two are not separated in Nazi planning. They
are a continuous unfolding of the Nazi plan to exterminate peoples
and institutions which might serve as a focus or instrument for
overturning their “new world order” at any time. We consider
these Crimes against Humanity in this address as manifestations
of the one Nazi plan and discuss them according to General von
Fritsch’s classification.</p>

<h4>1. The Battle Against the Working Class</h4>

<p class='pindent'>When Hitler came to power, there were in Germany three
groups of trade unions. The General German Trade Union Confederation
(ADGB) with twenty-eight affiliated unions, and the
General Independent Employees Confederation (AFA) with thirteen
federated unions together numbered more than 4,500,000
members. The Christian Trade Union had over 1,250,000 members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The working people of Germany, like the working people of
other nations, had little to gain personally by war. While labor
is usually brought around to the support of the nation at war,
labor by and large is a pacific, though by no means a pacifist force
in the world. The working people of Germany had not forgotten
in 1933 how heavy the yoke of the war lord can be. It was the
workingmen who had joined the sailors and soldiers in the revolt
of 1918 to end the First World War. The Nazis had neither forgiven
nor forgotten. The Nazi program required that this part
of the German population not only be stripped of power to resist
diversion of its scanty comforts to armament, but also be wheedled
or whipped into new and unheard of sacrifices as part of the
Nazi war preparation. Labor must be cowed, and that meant its
organizations and means of cohesion and defense must be destroyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The purpose to regiment labor for the Nazi Party was avowed
by Ley in a speech to workers on May 2, 1933, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“You may say what else do you want, you have the absolute
power. True we have the power, but we do not have the
whole people, we do not have you workers 100%, and it is
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
you whom we want; we will not let you be until you stand
with us in complete, genuine acknowledgment.” (<span class='it'>614-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The first Nazi attack was upon the two larger unions. On April
21, 1933 an order not even in the name of the Government, but of
the Nazi Party was issued by the conspirator Robert Ley as
“Chief of Staff of the political organization of the NSDAP,” applicable
to the Trade Union Confederation and the Independent
Employees Confederation. It directed seizure of their properties
and arrest of their principal leaders. The party order directed
party organs which we here denounce as criminal associations,
the SA and SS “to be employed for the occupation of the trade
union properties, and for the taking into custody of personalities
who come into question.” And it directed the taking into “protective
custody” of all chairmen and district secretaries of such
unions and branch directors of the labor bank (<span class='it'>392-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>These orders were carried out on May 2, 1933. All funds of
the labor unions, including pension and benefit funds, were seized.
Union leaders were sent to concentration camps. A few days
later, on May 10, 1933, Hitler appointed Ley leader of the German
Labor Front (<span class='it'>DEUTSCHE ARBEITSFRONT</span>), which succeeded
to the confiscated union funds. The German Labor Front, a Nazi
controlled labor bureau, was set up under Ley to teach the Nazi
philosophy to German workers and to weed out from industrial
employment all who were backward in their lessons (<span class='it'>1940-PS</span>).
“Factory Troops” were organized as an “ideological shock squad
within the factory” (<span class='it'>1817-PS</span>). The Party order provided that
“outside of the German Labor Front, no other organization
(whether of workers or of employees) is to exist.” On June 24,
1933 the remaining Christian Trade Unions were seized pursuant
to an order of the Nazi Party signed by Ley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On May 19, 1933, this time by government decree, it was provided
that “trustees” of labor, appointed by Hitler, should regulate
the conditions of all labor contracts, replacing the former
process of collective bargaining (<span class='it'>405-PS</span>). On January 20, 1934
a decree “regulating national labor” introduced the fuehrer-principle
into industrial relations. It provided that the owners of enterprises
should be the “fuehrers” and the workers should be the
followers. The enterpriser-fuehrers should “make decisions for
employees and laborers in all matters concerning the enterprise”
(<span class='it'>1861-PS</span>). It was by such bait that the great German industrialists
were induced to support the Nazi cause, to their own ultimate
ruin.
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Not only did the Nazis dominate and regiment German labor,
but they forced the youth into the ranks of the laboring people
they had thus led into chains. Under a compulsory labor service
decree on 26 June, 1935, young men and women between the ages
of 18 and 25 were conscripted for labor (see <span class='it'>1654-PS</span>). Thus was
the purpose to subjugate German labor accomplished. In the words
of Ley, this accomplishment consisted “in eliminating the association
character of the trade union and employees’ associations,
and in its place we have substituted the conception ‘soldiers of
work’.” The productive manpower of the German nation was in
Nazi control. By these steps the defendants won the battle to
liquidate labor unions as potential opposition and were enabled to
impose upon the working class the burdens of preparing for aggressive
warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Ley, the field marshal of the battle against labor, answered
our indictment with suicide. Apparently he knew no better
answer.</p>

<h4>2. The Battle Against the Churches</h4>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi Party always was predominantly anti-Christian in its
ideology. But we who believe in freedom of conscience and of
religion base no charge of criminality on anybody’s ideology. It
is not because the Nazi themselves were irreligious or pagan, but
because they persecuted others of the Christian faith that they
become guilty of crime, and it is because the persecution was a
step in the preparation for aggressive warfare that the offense
becomes one of international consequence. To remove every moderating
influence among the German people and to put its population
on a total war footing, the conspirators devised and carried
out a systematic and relentless repression of all Christian sects
and churches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will ask you to convict the Nazis on their own evidence.
Martin Bormann in June, 1941, issued a secret decree on the relation
of Christianity and National Socialism. The decree provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“For the first time in German history the Fuehrer consciously
and completely has the leadership of the people in
his own hand. With the party, its components and attached
units the Fuehrer has created for himself and thereby the
German Reich leadership an instrument which makes him
independent of the church. All influences which might impair
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
or damage the leadership of the people exercised by the
Fuehrer with help of the NSDAP, must be eliminated. More
and more the people must be separated from the churches
and their organs, the pastors. Of course, the churches must
and will, seen from their viewpoint, defend themselves against
this loss of power. But never again must an influence on
leadership of the people be yielded to the churches. This (influence)
must be broken completely and finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only the Reich government and by its direction the party,
its components and attached units have a right to leadership
of the people. Just as the deleterious influences of astrologers,
seers and other fakers are eliminated and suppressed
by the state, so must the possibility of church influence also
be totally removed. Not until this has happened, does the
state leadership have influence on the individual citizens. Not
until then are people and Reich secure in their existence for
all the future” (<span class='it'>D-75</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And how the party had been securing the Reich from Christian
influence, will be proved by such items as this teletype from the
Gestapo, Berlin, to the Gestapo, Nurnberg, on July 24, 1938. Let
us hear their own account of events in Rottenburg.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“The Party on 23 July 1939 from 2100 on carried out the
third demonstration against Bishop Sproll. Participants
about 2500-3000 were brought in from outside by bus, etc.
The Rottenburg populace again did not participate in the
demonstration. This town took rather a hostile attitude to
the demonstrations. The action got completely out of hand of
the Party Member responsible for it. The demonstrators
stormed the palace, beat in the gates and doors. About 150
to 200 people forced their way into the palace, searched the
rooms, threw files out of the windows and rummaged through
the beds in the rooms of the palace. One bed was ignited. Before
the fire got to the other objects of equipment in the
rooms and the palace, the flaming bed could be thrown from
the window and the fire extinguished. The Bishop was with
Archbishop Groeber of Freiburg and the ladies and gentlemen
of his menage in the chapel at prayer. About 25 to 30
people pressed into this chapel and molested those present.
Bishop Groeber was taken for Bishop Sproll. He was grabbed
by the robe and dragged back and forth. Finally the intruders
realized that Bishop Groeber is not the one they are seeking.
They could then be persuaded to leave the building. After the
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
evacuation of the palace by the demonstrators I had an interview
with Archbishop Groeber, who left Rottenburg in
the night. Groeber wants to turn to the Fuehrer and Reich
Minister of the Interior, Dr. Frick, anew. On the course of
the action, the damage done as well as the homage of the
Rottenburg populace beginning today for the Bishop I shall
immediately hand in a full report, after I am in the act of
suppressing counter mass meetings. * * *</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In case the Fuehrer has instructions to give in this matter,
I request that these be transmitted most quickly
* * *” (<span class='it'>848-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Later, defendant Rosenberg wrote to Bormann reviewing the
proposal of Kerrl as Church Minister to place the Protestant
Church under State tutelage and proclaim Hitler its Supreme
head. Rosenberg was opposed, hinting that Naziism was to suppress
the Christian Church completely after the war (see
<span class='it'>098-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The persecution of all pacifist and dissenting sects, such as
Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Pentecostal Association, was peculiarly
relentless and cruel. The policy toward the Evangelical
Churches, however, was to use their influence for the Nazis’ own
purposes. In September, 1933, Mueller was appointed the Fuehrer’s
representative with power to deal with the “affairs of the
Evangelical Church” in its relations to the State. Eventually,
steps were taken to create a Reich Bishop vested with power to
control this Church. A long conflict followed, Pastor Niemoeller
was sent to concentration camp, and extended interference with
the internal discipline and administration of the Churches occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A most intense drive was directed against the Roman Catholic
Church. After a strategic concordat with the Holy See, signed
in July, 1933 in Rome, which never was observed by the Nazi
Party, a long and persistent persecution of the Catholic Church,
its priesthood and its members, was carried out. Church Schools
and educational institutions were suppressed or subjected to requirements
of Nazi teaching inconsistent with the Christian
faith. The property of the Church was confiscated and inspired
vandalism directed against Church property was left unpunished.
Religious instruction was impeded and the exercise of religion
made difficult. Priests and bishops were laid upon, riots were
stimulated to harass them, and many were sent to concentration
camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After occupation of foreign soil, these persecutions went on
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
with greater vigor than ever. We will present to you from the
files of the Vatican the earnest protests made by the Vatican to
Ribbentrop summarizing the persecutions to which the priesthood
and the Church had been subjected in this Twentieth Century
under the Nazi regime. Ribbentrop never answered them.
He could not deny. He dared not justify.</p>

<h4>3. Crimes Against the Jews</h4>

<p class='pindent'>The most savage and numerous crimes planned and committed
by the Nazis were those against the Jews. These in Germany, in
1933, numbered about 500,000. In the aggregate, they had made
for themselves positions which excited envy, and had accumulated
properties which excited the avarice of the Nazis. They
were few enough to be helpless and numerous enough to be held
up as a menace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let there be no misunderstanding about the charge of persecuting
Jews. What we charge against these defendants is not
those arrogances and pretensions which frequently accompany
the intermingling of different peoples and which are likely despite
the honest efforts of government, to produce regrettable crimes
and convulsions. It is my purpose to show a plan and design, to
which all Nazis were fanatically committed, to annihilate all
Jewish people. These crimes were organized and promoted by the
Party Leadership, executed and protected by the Nazi officials, as
we shall convince you by written orders of the Secret State Police
itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The persecution of the Jews was a continuous and deliberate
policy. It was a policy directed against other nations as well
as against the Jews themselves. Anti-Semitism was promoted to
divide and embitter the democratic peoples and to soften their
resistance to the Nazi aggression. As Robert Ley declared in
<span class='it'>Der Angriff</span> on 14 May 1944, “The second German secret weapon
is Anti-Semitism because if it is constantly pursued by Germany,
it will become a universal problem which all nations will be
forced to consider.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anti-Semitism also has been aptly credited with being a
“spearhead of terror.” The ghetto was the laboratory for testing
repressive measures. Jewish property was the first to be expropriated,
but the custom grew and included similar measures
against Anti-Nazi Germans, Poles, Czechs, Frenchmen, and Belgians.
Extermination of the Jews enabled the Nazis to bring a
practiced hand to similar measures against Poles, Serbs, and
Greeks. The plight of the Jew was a constant threat to opposition
or discontent among other elements of Europe’s population—pacifists,
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
conservatives, communists, Catholics, Protestants, socialist.
It was, in fact, a threat to every dissenting opinion and
to every non-Nazi’s life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The persecution policy against the Jews commenced with non-violent
measures, such as disfranchisement and discriminations
against their religion, and the placing of impediments in the way
of success in economic life. It moved rapidly to organized mass
violence against them, physical isolation in ghettos, deportation,
forced labor, mass starvation, and extermination. The Government,
the Party formation indicated before you as criminal organizations,
the Secret State Police, the Army, private and semi-public
associations, and “spontaneous” mobs that were carefully
inspired from official sources, were all agencies concerned in this
persecution. Nor was it directed against individual Jews for personal
bad citizenship or unpopularity. The avowed purpose was
the destruction of the Jewish people as a whole, as an end in itself,
as a measure of preparation for war, and as a discipline of
conquered peoples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conspiracy or common plan to exterminate the Jew was so
methodically and thoroughly pursued that despite the German
defeat and Nazi prostration, this Nazi aim largely has succeeded.
Only remnants of the European Jewish population remain in
Germany, in the countries which Germany occupied, and in those
which were her satellites or collaborators. Of the 9,600,000 Jews
who lived in Nazi-dominated Europe, 60 percent are authoritatively
estimated to have perished. 5,700,000 Jews are missing
from the countries in which they formerly lived, and over 4,500,000
cannot be accounted for by the normal death rate nor by immigration;
nor are they included among displaced persons. History
does not record a crime ever perpetrated against so many
victims or one ever carried out with such calculated cruelty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will have difficulty, as I have, to look into the faces of
these defendants and believe that in this Twentieth Century human
beings could inflict such sufferings as will be proved here on
their own countrymen as well as upon their so-called “inferior”
enemies. Particular crimes, and the responsibility of defendants
for them, are to be dealt with by the Soviet Government’s Counsel,
when committed in the East, and by Counsel for the Republic
of France when committed in the West. I advert to them only
to show their magnitude as evidence of a purpose and a knowledge
common to all defendants, of an official plan rather than of
a capricious policy of some individual commander, and to show
such a continuity of Jewish persecution from the rise of the Nazi
conspiracy to its collapse as forbids us to believe that any person
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
could be identified with any part of Nazi action without approving
this most conspicuous item of its program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indictment itself recites many evidences of the anti-Semitic
persecutions. The defendant Streicher led the Nazis in
anti-Semitic bitterness and extremism. In an article appearing
in <span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span> on 19 March, 1942 he complained that Christian
teachings have stood in the way of “radical solution of the Jewish
question in Europe,” and quoted enthusiastically as the Twentieth
Century solution the Fuehrer’s proclamation of February
24, 1942 that “the Jew will be exterminated.” And on November
4, 1943, Streicher declared in <span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span> that the Jews “have
disappeared from Europe and that the Jewish ‘Reservoir of the
East’ from which the Jewish plague has for centuries beset the
people of Europe, has ceased to exist.” Streicher now has the
effrontery to tell us he is “only a Zionist”—he says he wants only
to return the Jews to Palestine. But on May 7, 1942 his newspaper,
<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>, had this to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“It is also not only an European problem! <span class='it'>The Jewish
question is a world question!</span> Not only is Germany not safe
in the face of the Jews as long as one Jew lives in Europe,
but also the Jewish question is hardly solved in Europe so
long as Jews live in the rest of the world.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And the defendant Hans Frank, a lawyer by profession I say
with shame, summarized in his Diary in 1944 the Nazi policy
thus: “The Jews are a race which has to be eliminated; whenever
we catch one, it is his end.” (Frank Diary, 4 March 1944, p.
26). And earlier, speaking of his function as Governor-General
of Poland, he confided to his diary this sentiment: “Of course I
cannot eliminate all lice and Jews in only a year’s time.”
(<span class='it'>2233-C-PS</span>) I could multiply endlessly this kind of Nazi ranting
but I will leave it to the evidence and turn to the fruit of this
perverted thinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most serious of the actions against Jews were outside of
any law, but the law itself was employed to some extent. There
were the infamous Nurnberg decrees of September 15, 1935
(<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> 1935, Part I, p. 1146). The Jews were segregated
into ghettos and put into forced labor; they were expelled
from their professions; their property was expropriated; all cultural
life, the press, the theatre, and schools were prohibited
them; and the SD was made responsible for them (<span class='it'>212-PS</span>; <span class='it'>069-PS</span>).
This was an ominous guardianship, as the following order
for “The Handling of the Jewish Question” shows:
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“The competency of the Chief of the Security Police and
Security Service, who is charged with the mission of solving
the European Jewish question, extends even to the occupied
eastern provinces. * * *</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An eventual act by the civilian population against the
Jews is not to be prevented as long as this is compatible with
the maintenance of order and security in the rear of the
fighting troops * * *</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first main goal of the German measures must be
strict segregation of Jewry from the rest of the population.
In the execution of this, first of all is the seizing of the Jewish
populace by the introduction of a registration order and
similar appropriate measures * * *</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then immediately, the wearing of the recognition sign
consisting of a yellow Jewish star is to be brought about and
all rights of freedom for Jews are to be withdrawn. They
are to be placed in Ghettos and at the same time are to be
separated according to sexes. The presence of many more
or less closed Jewish settlements in White Ruthenia and in the
Ukraine makes this mission easier. Moreover, places are to
be chosen which make possible the full use of the Jewish
manpower in case labor needs are present * * *</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The entire Jewish property is to be seized and confiscated
with exception of that which is necessary for a bare existence.
As far as the economical situation permits, the power
of disposal of their property is to be taken from the Jews as
soon as possible through orders and other measures given by
the commissariate, so that the moving of property will
quickly cease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any cultural activity will be completely forbidden, to the
Jew. This includes the outlawing of the Jewish press, the
Jewish theatres and schools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The slaughtering of animals according to Jewish rites
is also to be prohibited * * *” (<span class='it'>212-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The anti-Jewish campaign became furious in Germany following
the assassination in Paris of the German Legation Councillor
von Rath. Heydrich, Gestapo head, sent a teletype to all Gestapo
and SD offices with directions for handling “spontaneous”
uprising anticipated for the nights of November 9 and 10, 1938,
so as to aid in destruction of Jewish-owned property and protect
only that of Germans (<span class='it'>374-PS</span>; <span class='it'>765-PS</span>). No more cynical document
ever came into evidence. Then there is a report by an SS
Brigade Leader, Dr. Stahlecher, to Himmler, which recites that:
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Similarly, native anti-Semitic forces were induced to
start pogroms against Jews during the first hours after capture,
though this inducement proved to be very difficult. Following
our orders, the Security Police was determined to
solve the Jewish question with all possible means and most
decisively. But it was desirable that the Security Police
should not put in an immediate appearance, at least in the
beginning, since the extraordinarily harsh measures were
apt to stir even German circles. It had to be shown to the
world that the native population itself took the first action
by way of natural reaction against the suppression by Jews

<p class='pindent'>“In view of the extension of the area of operations and the
great number of duties which had to be performed by the
Security Police, it was intended from the very beginning to
obtain the cooperation of the reliable population for the
fight against vermin—that is mainly the Jews and Communists.
Beyond our directing of the first spontaneous actions
of self-cleansing, which will be reported elsewhere, care had
to be taken that reliable people should be put to the cleansing
job and that they were appointed auxiliary members of
the Security Police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kowno * * * To our surprise it was not easy at first
to set in motion an extensive pogrom against Jews. KLIMATIS,
the leader of the partisan unit, mentioned above,
who was used for this purpose primarily, succeeded in starting
a pogrom on the basis of advice given to him by a small
advanced detachment acting in Kowno, and in such a way
that no German order or German instigation was noticed
from the outside. During the first pogrom in the night from
25. to 26.6 the Lithuanian partisans did away with more
than 1,500 Jews, set fire to several synagogues or destroyed
them by other means and burned down a Jewish dwelling
district consisting of about 60 houses. During the following
nights about 2,300 Jews were made harmless in a similar
way. In other parts of Lithuania similar actions followed
the example of Kowno, though smaller and extending to the
Communists who had been left behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These self-cleansing actions went smoothly because the
Army authorities who had been informed showed understanding
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
for this procedure. From the beginning it was obvious
that only the first days after the occupation would offer the
opportunity for carrying out pogroms. After the disarmament
of the partisans the self-cleansing actions ceased necessarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It proved much more difficult to set in motion similar
cleansing actions in Latvia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the beginning it was to be expected that the Jewish
problem in the East could not be solved by pogroms alone.
In accordance with the basic orders received, however, the
cleansing activities of the Security Police had to aim at a
complete annihilation of the Jews * * *</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sum total of the Jews liquidated in Lithuania amounts
to 71,105.” (<span class='it'>L-180</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, it is self-evident that these “uprisings” were managed
by the government and the Nazi Party. If we were in doubt,
we could resort to Streicher’s memorandum of April 14, 1939,
which says, “The anti-Jewish action of November, 1938 did not
arise spontaneously from the people. * * * Part of the
party formation have been charged with the execution of the
anti-Jewish action.” (<span class='it'>406-PS</span>). Jews as a whole were fined a billion
Reichsmarks. They were excluded from all businesses, and
claims against insurance companies for their burned properties
were confiscated, all by decree of the defendant Goering (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
1938, Part I, Pp. 1579-1582).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Synagogues were the objects of a special vengeance. On November
10, 1938, the following order was given: “By order of the
Group Commander, all Jewish Synagogues in the area of Brigade
50 have to be blown up or set afire. * * * The operation
will be carried out in civilian clothing. * * * Execution of
the order will be reported * * *.” (<span class='it'>1721-PS</span>). Some 40 teletype
messages from various police headquarters will tell the
fury with which all Jews were pursued in Germany on those
awful November nights. The SS troops were turned loose and
the Gestapo supervised. Jewish-owned property was authorized to
be destroyed. The Gestapo ordered twenty to thirty thousand
“well-to-do Jews” to be arrested. Concentration camps were to
receive them. Healthy Jews, fit for labor, were to be taken
(<span class='it'>3051-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the German frontiers were expanded by war, so the campaign
against the Jews expanded. The Nazi plan never was limited
to extermination in Germany; always it contemplated extinguishing
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
the Jew in Europe and often in the world. In the west,
the Jews were killed and their property taken over. But the campaign
achieved its zenith of savagery in the East. The Eastern
Jew has suffered as no people ever suffered. Their sufferings were
carefully reported to the Nazi authorities to show faithful adherence
to the Nazi design. I shall refer only to enough of the
evidence of these to show the extent of the Nazi design for killing
Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I should recite these horrors in words of my own, you would
think me intemperate and unreliable. Fortunately, we need not
take the word of any witness but the Germans themselves. I invite
you now to look at a few of the vast number of captured
German orders and reports that will be offered in evidence, to
see what a Nazi invasion meant. We will present such evidence
as the report of <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppe</span> (Action Group) A of October 15,
1941, which boasts that in overrunning the Baltic States, “Native
Anti-Semitic forces were induced to start pogroms against the
Jews during the first hours after occupation * * *.” The report
continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“From the beginning it was to be expected that the Jewish
problem in the East could not be solved by pogroms
alone. In accordance with the basic orders received, however,
the cleansing activities of the Security Police had to aim at a
complete annihilation of the Jews. Special detachments reinforced
by selected units—in Lithuania partisan detachments,
in Latvia units of the Latvian auxiliary police—therefore
performed extensive executions both in the towns and
in rural areas. The actions of the execution detachments
were performed smoothly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sum total of the Jews liquidated in Lithuania
amounts to 71,105. During the pogroms in Kowno 3,800 Jews
were eliminated, in the smaller towns about 1,200 Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Latvia, up to now a total of 30,000 Jews were executed.
500 were eliminated by pogroms in Riga.” (<span class='it'>L-180</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a captured report from the Commissioner of Sluzk on
October 30, 1941, which describes the scene in more detail. It
says:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“The first lieutenant explained that the police battalion
had received the assignment to effect the liquidation of all
Jews here in the town of Sluzk, within two days. Then I requested
him to postpone the action one day. However, he
rejected this with the remark that he had to carry out this
action everywhere and in all towns and that only two days
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
were allotted for Sluzk. Within these two days, the town of
Sluzk had to be cleared of Jews by all means. * * * All
Jews without exception were taken out of the factories and
shops and deported in spite of our agreement. It is true that
part of the Jews was moved by way of the ghetto where
many of them were processed and still segregated by me, but
a large part was loaded directly on trucks and liquidated
without further delay outside of the town. * * * For
the rest, as regards the execution of the action, I must point
out to my deepest regret that the latter bordered already on
sadism. The town itself offered a picture of horror during
the action. With indescribable brutality on the part of both
the German police officers and particularly the Lithuanian
partisans, the Jewish people, but also among them White
Ruthenians, were taken out of their dwellings and herded together.
Everywhere in the town shots were to be heard and
in different streets the corpses of shot Jews accumulated.
The White Ruthenians were in greatest distress to free
themselves from the encirclement. Regardless of the fact
that the Jewish people, among whom were also tradesmen,
were mistreated in a terribly barbarous way in the face of
the White Ruthenian people, the White Ruthenians themselves
were also worked over with rubber clubs and rifle
butts. There was no question of an action against the Jews
any more. It rather looked like a revolution. * * *”
(<span class='it'>1104-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There are reports which merely tabulate the numbers slaughtered.
An example is an account of the work of <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppen</span>
of Sipo and SD in the East, which relates that—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>In Estonia, all Jews were arrested immediately upon the
arrival of the Wehrmacht. Jewish men and women above
the age of 16 and capable of work were drafted for forced
labor. Jews were subjected to all sorts of restrictions and
all Jewish property was confiscated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All Jewish males above the age of 16 were executed, with
the exception of doctors and elders. Only 500 of an original
4,500 Jews remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>37,180 persons have been liquidated by the Sipo and SD in
White Ruthenia during October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one town, 337 Jewish women were executed for demonstrating
a “provocative attitude.” In another, 380 Jews were
shot for spreading vicious propaganda.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the report continues, listing town after town, where
hundreds upon hundreds of Jews were murdered.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>In Witebsk 3,000 Jews were liquidated because of the danger
of epidemics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Kiew, 33,771 Jews were executed on September 29 and
30 in retaliation for some fires which were set off there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Shitomir, 3,145 Jews “had to be shot” because, judging
from experience they had to be considered as the carriers of
Bolshevik propaganda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Cherson, 410 Jews were executed in reprisal against
acts of sabotage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the territory east of the Djnepr, the Jewish problem
was “solved” by the liquidation of 4,891 Jews and by putting
the remainder into labor battalions of up to 1,000 persons
(<span class='it'>R-102</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Other accounts tell not of the slaughter so much as of the
depths of degradation to which the tormentors stooped. For example,
we will show the reports made to defendant Rosenberg
about the army and the SS in the area under Rosenberg’s jurisdiction,
which recited the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Details: In presence of SS man, a Jewish dentist has
to break all gold teeth and fillings out of mouth of German
and Russian Jews <span class='it'>before</span> they are executed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men, women and children are locked into barns and burned
alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peasants, women and children are shot on pretext that they
are suspected of belonging to bands (<span class='it'>R-135</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We of the Western World heard of Gas Wagons in which Jews
and political opponents were asphyxiated. We could not believe
it. But here we have the report of May 16, 1942 from the German
SS officer, Becker, to his supervisor in Berlin which tells
this story:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>Gas vans in C. group can be driven to execution spot,
which is generally stationed 10 to 15 kms. from main road
only in dry weather. Since those to be executed become
frantic if conducted to this place, such vans become immobilized
in wet weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gas vans in D. group camouflaged as cabin trailers, but
vehicles well known to authorities and civilian population
which calls them “Death Vans”.
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Writer of letter (Becker) ordered all men to keep as far
away as possible during gassing. Unloading van has
“atrocious spiritual and physical effect” on men and they
should be ordered not to participate in such work (<span class='it'>501-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not dwell on this subject longer than to quote one more
sickening document which evidences the planned and systematic
character of the Jewish persecutions. I hold a report written
with Teutonic devotion to detail, illustrated with photographs
to authenticate its almost incredible text, and beautifully bound
in leather with the loving care bestowed on a proud work. It is
the original report of the SS Brigadier General Stroop in charge
of the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto, and its title page carries
the inscription, “The Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw no longer
exists.” It is characteristic that one of the captions explains that
the photograph concerned shows the driving out of Jewish “bandits”;
those whom the photograph shows being driven out are
almost entirely women and little children. It contains a day-by-day
account of the killings mainly carried out by the SS organization,
too long to relate, but let me quote General Stroop’s
summary:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“The resistance put up by the Jews and bandits could only
be suppressed by energetic actions of our troops day and
night. <span class='it'>The Reichsfuehrer SS ordered, therefore on 23 April
1943 the cleaning out of the ghetto with utter ruthlessness
and merciless tenacity.</span> I, therefore, decided to destroy and
burn down the entire ghetto without regard to the armament
factories. These factories were systematically dismantled
and then burned. Jews usually left their hideouts,
but frequently remained in the burning buildings and jumped
out of the windows only when the heat became unbearable.
They then tried to crawl with broken bones across the street
into buildings which were not afire. Sometimes they changed
their hideouts during the night into the ruins of burned
buildings. Life in the sewers was not pleasant after the first
week. Many times we could hear loud voices in the sewers.
SS men or policemen climbed bravely through the manholes
to capture these Jews. Sometimes they stumbled over Jewish
corpses; sometimes they were shot at. Tear gas bombs
were thrown into the manholes and the Jews driven out of
the sewers and captured. Countless numbers of Jews were
liquidated in sewers and bunkers through blasting. The
longer the resistance continued the tougher became the
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
members of the Waffen SS police and Wehrmacht who always
discharged their duties in an exemplary manner. Frequently
Jews who tried to replenish their food supplies during
the night or to communicate with neighboring groups
were exterminated.” (<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This action eliminated, says the SS commander, “a proved total
of 56,065. To that we have to add the number of those killed
through blasting, fire, etc., which cannot be counted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We charge that all atrocities against Jews were the manifestation
and culmination of the Nazi plan to which every defendant
here was a party. I know very well that some of these men did
take steps to spare some particular Jew for some personal reason
from the horrors that awaited the unrescued Jew. Some protested
that particular atrocities were excessive, and discredited
the general policy. While a few defendants may show efforts to
make specific exceptions to the policy of Jewish extermination,
I have found no instance in which any defendant opposed the
policy itself or sought to revoke or even modify it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Determination to destroy the Jews was a binding force which at
all times cemented the elements of this conspiracy. On many internal
policies there were differences among the defendants. But
there is not one of them who has not echoed the rallying cry of
Naziism—<span class='it'>DEUTSCHLAND ERWACHE JUDA VERRECKE!</span>
(GERMANY AWAKE, JEWRY PERISH!)</p>

<h4>TERRORISM AND PREPARATION FOR WAR</h4>

<p class='pindent'>How a Government treats its own inhabitants generally is
thought to be no concern of other Governments or of international
society. Certainly few oppressions or cruelties would warrant the
intervention of foreign powers. But the German mistreatment
of Germans is now known to pass in magnitude and savagery any
limits of what is tolerable by modern civilization. Other nations,
by silence, would take a consenting part in such crimes. These
Nazi persecutions, moreover, take character as international
crimes because of the purpose for which they were undertaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The purpose, as we have seen, of getting rid of the influence of
free labor, the churches, and the Jews was to clear their obstruction
to the precipitation of aggressive war. If aggressive
warfare in violation of treaty obligation is a matter of international
cognizance, the preparations for it must also be of concern
to the international community. Terrorism was the chief
instrument for securing the cohesion of the German people in
war purposes. Moreover, these cruelties in Germany served as
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
atrocity practice to discipline the membership of the criminal
organization to follow the pattern later in occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the police formations that before you are accused as
criminal organizations, the Nazi Party leaders, aided at some
point in their basic and notorious purpose by each of the individual
defendants instituted a reign of terror. These espionage
and police organizations were utilized to hunt down every form of
opposition and to penalize every nonconformity. These organizations
early founded and administered concentration camps—Buchenwald
in 1933, Dachau in 1934. But these notorious names were
not alone. Concentration camps came to dot the German map
and to number scores. At first they met with resistance from
some Germans. We have a captured letter from Minister of Justice
Guertner to Hitler which is revealing. A Gestapo official had
been prosecuted for crimes committed in the camp at Hohnstein,
and the Nazi Governor of Saxony had promptly asked that the
proceeding be quashed. The Minister of Justice in June of 1935
protested because, as he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“In this camp unusually grave mistreatments of prisoners
have occurred at least since Summer 1933. The prisoners not
only were beaten with whips without cause, similarly as in
the Concentration Camp Bredow near Stettin till they lost
consciousness, but they were also tortured in other manners,
e.g. with the help of a dripping apparatus constructed exclusively
for this purpose, under which prisoners had to
stand until they were suffering from serious purulent wounds
of the scalp * * *” (<span class='it'>787-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not take time to detail the ghastly proceedings in these
concentration camps. Beatings, starvings, tortures, and killings
were routine—so routine that the tormenters became blase and
careless. We have a report of discovery that in Ploetzens one
night, 186 persons were executed while there were orders for
only 180. Another report describes how the family of one victim
received two urns of ashes by mistake. Inmates were compelled
to execute each other. In 1942, they were paid five Reichsmarks
per execution, but on June 27, 1942, SS General Gluecks ordered
commandants of all concentration camps to reduce this honorarium
to three cigarettes. In 1943, the Reichsleader of the SS
and Chief of German Police ordered the corporal punishments on
Russian women to be applied by Polish women and vice versa,
but the price was not frozen. “As reward, a few cigarettes” was
authorized. Under the Nazis, human life had been progressively
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
devalued until it finally became worth less than a handful of
tobacco—ersatz tobacco. There were, however, some traces of the
milk of human kindness. On August 11, 1942, an order went from
Himmler to the commanders of fourteen concentration camps
that “only German prisoners are allowed to beat other German
prisoners.” (<span class='it'>2189-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mystery and suspense was added to cruelty in order to spread
torture from the inmate to his family and friends. Men and
women disappeared from their homes or business or from the
streets, and no word came of them. The omission of notice was
not due to overworked staff; it was due to policy. The Chief of
the SD and Sipo reported that in accordance with orders from
the Fuehrer anxiety should be created in the minds of the family
of the arrested person (<span class='it'>668-PS</span>). Deportations and secret arrests
were labeled, with a Nazi wit which seems a little ghoulish,
<span class='it'>Nacht und Nebel</span> (Night and Fog) (<span class='it'>L-90, 833-PS</span>). One of the
many orders for these actions gave this explanation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“The decree carries a basic innovation. The Fuehrer and
Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces commands that
crimes of the specified sort committed by civilians of the
occupied territories are to be punished by the pertinent
courts-martial in the occupied territories <span class='it'>only</span> when</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>a.</span> the sentence calls for the death penalty, and</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>b.</span> the sentence is pronounced within 8 days after the
arrest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only when both conditions are met does the Fuehrer
and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces hope for the
desired deterrent effect from the conduct of punitive proceedings
in the occupied territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In other cases in the future the accused are to be secretly
brought to Germany and the further conduct of the
trial carried on here. The deterrent effect of those measures
lies</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>a.</span> in allowing the disappearance of the accused without a
trace,</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>b.</span> therein, that no information whatsoever may be given
about their whereabouts and their fate.” (<span class='it'>833-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To clumsy cruelty, scientific skill was added. “Undesirables”
were exterminated by injection of drugs into the bloodstream, by
asphyxiation in gas chambers. They were shot with poison bullets,
to study the effects (<span class='it'>L-103</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, to cruel experiments the Nazi added obscene ones. These
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
were not the work of underling degenerates but of master minds
high in the Nazi conspiracy. In May 20, 1942, General Field
Marshal Milch authorized SS General Wolff to go ahead at Dachau
Camp with so-called “cold experiments”; and four female gypsies
were supplied for the purpose. Himmler gave permission to carry
on these “experiments” also in other camps (<span class='it'>1617-PS</span>). At Dachau,
the reports of the “doctor” in charge show that victims were
immersed in cold water until their body temperature was reduced
to 28 degrees centigrade (82.4 degrees Fahrenheit), when they all
died immediately (<span class='it'>1618-PS</span>). This was in August 1942. But the
“doctor’s” technique improved. By February, 1943, he was able
to report that thirty persons were chilled to 27 to 29 degrees,
their hands and feet frozen white, and their bodies “rewarmed”
by a hot bath. But the Nazi scientific triumph was “rewarming
with animal heat.” The victim, all but frozen to death, was surrounded
with bodies of living women until he revived and responded
to his environment by having sexual intercourse (<span class='it'>1616-PS</span>).
Here Nazi degeneracy reached its nadir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I dislike to encumber the record with such morbid tales, but
we are in the grim business of trying men as criminals, and these
are the things their own agents say happened. We will show you
these concentration camps in motion pictures, just as the Allied
armies found them when they arrived, and the measures General
Eisenhower had to take to clean them up. Our proof will be disgusting
and you will say I have robbed you of your sleep. But
these are the things which have turned the stomach of the world
and set every civilized hand against Nazi Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Germany became one vast torture chamber. Cries of its victims
were heard round the world and brought shudders to civilized
people everywhere. I am one who received during this war
most atrocity tales with suspicion and skepticism. But the proof
here will be so overwhelming that I venture to predict not one
word I have spoken will be denied. These defendants will only
deny personal responsibility or knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the clutch of the most intricate web of espionage and
intrigue that any modern state has endured, and persecution and
torture of a kind that has not been visited upon the world in
many centuries, the elements of the German population which
were both decent and courageous were annihilated. Those which
were decent but weak were intimidated. Open resistance, which
had never been more than feeble and irresolute, disappeared. But
resistance, I am happy to say, always remained, although it was
manifest in only such events as the abortive effort to assassinate
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
Hitler on July 20, 1944. With resistance driven underground, the
Nazi had the German State in his own hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Nazis not only silenced discordant voices. They created
positive controls as effective as their negative ones. Propaganda
organs, on a scale never before known, stimulated the
party and party formations with a permanent enthusiasm and
abandon such as we democratic people can work up only for a
few days before a general election. They inculcated and practiced
the <span class='it'>fuehrerprinzip</span>, which centralized control of the Party
and of the Party-controlled state over the lives and thought of
the German people, who are accustomed to look upon the German
State by whomever controlled with a mysticism that is incomprehensible
to my people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these controls from their inception were exerted with unparalleled
energy and singlemindedness to put Germany on a war
footing. We will show from the Nazis’ own documents their secret
training of military personnel, their secret creation of a
military air force. Finally, a conscript army was brought into being.
Financiers, economists, industrialists, joined in the plan and
promoted elaborate alterations in industry and finance to support
an unprecedented concentration of resources and energies upon
preparations for war. Germany’s rearmament so outstripped the
strength of her neighbors that in about a year she was able to
crush the whole military force of Continental Europe, exclusive
of that of Soviet Russia, and then to push the Russian armies back
to the Volga. These preparations were of a magnitude which surpassed
all need of defense and every defendant, and every intelligent
German, well understood them to be for aggressive purposes.</p>

<h4>EXPERIMENTS IN AGGRESSION</h4>

<p class='pindent'>Before resorting to open aggressive warfare, the Nazis undertook
some rather cautious experiments to test the spirit and resistance
of those who lay across their path. They advanced, but
only as others yielded, and kept in a position to draw back if
they found a temper that made persistence dangerous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 7 March 1936, the Nazis reoccupied the Rhineland and then
proceeded to fortify it in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and
the Pact of Locarno. They encountered no substantial resistance
and were emboldened to take the next step, which was the acquisition
of Austria. Despite repeated assurances that Germany
had no designs on Austria, invasion was perfected. Threat of attack
forced Schuschnigg to resign as Chancellor of Austria and
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
put the Nazi defendant Seyss-Inquart in his place. The latter immediately
opened the frontier and invited Hitler to invade Austria
“to preserve order.” On March 12th the invasion began.
The next day, Hitler proclaimed himself Chief of the Austrian
State, took command of its armed forces, and a law was enacted
annexing Austria to Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Threats of aggression had succeeded without arousing resistance.
Fears nevertheless had been stirred. They were lulled by
an assurance to the Czechoslovak Government that there would
be no attack on that country. We will show that the Nazi Government
already had detailed plans for the attack. We will lay
before you the documents in which these conspirators planned to
create an incident to justify their attack. They even gave consideration
to assassinating their own Ambassador at Prague in
order to create a sufficiently dramatic incident. They did precipitate
a diplomatic crisis which endured through the summer.
Hitler set September 30th as the day when troops should be ready
for action. Under the threat of immediate war, the United Kingdom
and France concluded a pact with Germany and Italy at Munich
on September 29, 1938 which required Czechoslovakia to acquiesce
in the cession of the Sudetenland to Germany. It was consummated
by German occupation on October 1, 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Munich Pact pledged no further aggression against Czechoslovakia,
but the Nazi pledge was lightly given and quickly broken.
On the 15th of March, 1939, in defiance of the treaty of Munich
itself, the Nazis seized and occupied Bohemia and Moravia,
which constituted the major part of Czechoslovakia not already
ceded to Germany. Once again the West stood aghast, but it
dreaded war, it saw no remedy except war, and it hoped against
hope that the Nazi fever for expansion had run its course. But
the Nazi world was intoxicated by these unresisted successes in
open alliance with Mussolini and covert alliance with Franco.
Then, having made a deceitful, delaying peace with Russia, the
conspirators entered upon the final phase of the plan to renew
war.</p>

<h4>WAR OF AGGRESSION</h4>

<p class='pindent'>I will not prolong this address by detailing the steps leading to
the war of aggression which began with the invasion of Poland
on September, 1, 1939. The further story will be unfolded to you
from documents including those of the German High Command
itself. The plans had been laid long in advance. As early as 1935
Hitler appointed the defendant Schacht to the position of “General
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
Deputy for the War Economy.” (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>). We have the
diary of General Jodl (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>); the “Plan Otto,” Hitler’s own
order for attack on Austria in case trickery failed (<span class='it'>C-102</span>); the
“Plan Green” which was the blueprint for attack on Czechoslovakia
(<span class='it'>388-PS</span>); plans for the War in the West (<span class='it'>376-PS</span>,
<span class='it'>375-PS</span>); Funk’s letter to Hitler dated August 25, 1939, detailing
the long course of economic preparation (<span class='it'>699-PS</span>); Keitel’s top
secret mobilization order for 1939-40 prescribing secret steps to
be taken during a “period of tension” during which no “ ‘state of
war’ will be publicly declared even if open war measures against
the foreign enemy will be taken.” This latter order (<span class='it'>1639-A-PS</span>)
is in our possession despite a secret order issued on March 16,
1945, when Allied troops were advancing into the heart of Germany,
to burn these plans. We have also Hitler’s directive, dated
December 18, 1940, for the “Barbarossa Contingency” outlining
the strategy of the attack upon Russia (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>). That plan in
the original bears the initials of the defendants Keitel and Jodl.
They were planning the attack and planning it long in advance
of the declaration of war. We have detailed information concerning
“Case White,” the plan for attack on Poland (<span class='it'>C-120</span>). That
attack began the war. The plan was issued by Keitel on April
3rd, 1939. The attack did not come until September. Steps in
preparation for the attack were taken by subordinate commanders,
one of whom issued an order on June 14, providing
that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“The Commander-in-Chief of the Army has ordered the
working out of a <span class='it'>plan of deployment against Poland</span> which
takes in account the demands of the political leadership <span class='it'>for
the opening of war by surprise and for quick success</span>
* * *</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I declare it the duty of the Commanding Generals, the
divisional commanders and the commandants to limit as
much as possible the number of persons who will be informed,
and to limit the extent of the information, and ask
that all suitable measures be taken to prevent persons not
concerned from getting information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The operation, in order to forestall an orderly Polish
mobilization and concentration, is to be opened by surprise
with forces which are for the most part armored and motorized,
placed on alert in the neighborhood of the border.
The initial superiority over the Polish frontier-guards and
surprise that can be expected with certainty are to be maintained
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
by quickly bringing up other parts of the army as
well to counteract the marching up of the Polish Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the development of the Political situation should show
that a surprise at the beginning of the war is out of question,
because of well advanced defense preparations on the
part of the Polish Army, the Commander-in-Chief of the
Army will order the opening of the hostilities only after the
assembling of sufficient additional forces. The basis of all
preparations will be to surprise the enemy.” (<span class='it'>2327-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>We have also the order for the invasion of England, signed by
Hitler and initialed by Keitel and Jodl. It is interesting that it
commences with a recognition that although the British military
position is “hopeless,” they show not the slightest sign of giving
in (<span class='it'>442-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not the least incriminating are the minutes of Hitler’s meeting
with his high advisers. As early as November 5, 1937, Hitler told
defendants Goering, Raeder, and Neurath, among others, that
German rearmament was practically accomplished and that he
had decided to secure by force, starting with a lightning attack
on Czechoslovakia and Austria, greater living space for Germans
in Europe no later than 1943-45 and perhaps as early as
1938 (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). On the 23rd of May, 1939, the Fuehrer advised
his staff that—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a question of expanding our living space in the
East and of securing our food supplies * * * over and
above the natural fertility, thorough-going German exploitation
will enormously increase the surplus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is therefore no question of sparing Poland, and
we are left with the decision: <span class='it'>To attack Poland at the first
suitable opportunity</span>. We cannot expect a repetition of the
Czech affair. There will be war.” (<span class='it'>L-79</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On August 22nd, 1939 Hitler again addressed members of the
High Command, telling them when the start of military operations
would be ordered. He disclosed that for propaganda
purposes, he would provocate a good reason. “It will make no
difference,” he announced, “whether this reason will sound convincing
or not. After all, the victor will not be asked whether
he talked the truth or not. We have to proceed brutally. The
stronger is always right.” (<span class='it'>1014-PS</span>). On 23 November 1939
after the Germans had invaded Poland, Hitler made this explanation:
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“For the first time in history we have to fight on only one
front, the other front is at present free. But no one can know
how long that will remain so. I have doubted for a long time
whether I should strike in the east and then in the west.
Basically I did not organize the armed forces in order not
to strike. The decision to strike was always in me. Earlier
or later I wanted to solve the problem. Under pressure it
was decided that the east was to be attacked first * * *”
(<span class='it'>789-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We know the bloody sequel. Frontier incidents were staged.
Demands were made for cession of territory. When Poland refused,
the German forces invaded on September 1st, 1939. Warsaw
was destroyed; Poland fell. The Nazis, in accordance with
plan, moved swiftly to extend their aggression throughout Europe
and to gain the advantage of surprise over their unprepared
neighbors. Despite repeated and solemn assurances of peaceful
intentions, they invaded Denmark and Norway on 9th April,
1940; Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg on 10th May,
1940; Yugoslavia and Greece on 6th April, 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As part of the Nazi preparation for aggression against Poland
and her allies, Germany, on 23rd August, 1939 had entered
into a nonaggression pact with Soviet-Russia. It was only a delaying
treaty intended to be kept no longer than necessary to
prepare for its violation. On June 22, 1941, pursuant to long matured
plans, the Nazis hurled troops into Soviet territory without
any declaration of war. The entire European world was
aflame.</p>

<h4>CONSPIRACY WITH JAPAN</h4>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi plans of aggression called for use of Asiatic allies
and they found among the Japanese men of kindred mind and
purpose. They were brothers, under the skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Himmler records a conversation he had on January 31, 1939
with General Oshima, Japanese Ambassador at Berlin. He wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Furthermore, he (Oshima) had succeeded up to now to
send 10 Russians with bombs across the Caucasian frontier.
These Russians had the mission to kill Stalin. A number of
additional Russians, whom he had also sent across, had been
shot at the frontier.” (<span class='it'>2195-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On September 27th, 1940, the Nazis concluded a German-Italian-Japanese
ten-year military and economic alliance by which
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
those powers agreed “to stand by and cooperate with one another
in regard to their efforts in Greater East Asia and regions of Europe
respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish
and maintain a new order of things * * *.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On March 5, 1941, a top secret directive was issued by defendant
Keitel. It stated that “The Fuehrer has ordered instigation of
Japan’s active participation in the war” and directed that
“Japan’s military power has to be strengthened by the disclosure
of German war experiences and support of a military, economic
and technical nature has to be given.” The aim was stated to be
to crush England quickly, “thereby keeping the United States out
of the war.” (<span class='it'>C-75</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On March 29, 1941, Ribbentrop told Matsuoka, the Japanese
Foreign Minister, that the German Army was ready to strike
against Russia. Matsuoka reassured Ribbentrop about the Far
East. Japan, he reported, was acting at the moment as though
she had no interest whatever in Singapore, but “intends to strike
when the right moment comes.” (<span class='it'>1877-PS</span>). On April 5, 1941,
Ribbentrop urged Matsuoka that entry of Japan into the war
would “hasten the victory” and would be more in the interest of
Japan that of Germany since it would give Japan a unique chance
to fulfill her national aims and to play a leading part in Eastern
Asia (<span class='it'>1882-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proofs in this case will also show that the leaders of Germany
were planning war against the United States from its Atlantic
as well as instigating it from its Pacific approaches. A captured
memorandum from the Fuehrer’s headquarters, dated October
29, 1940, asks certain information as to air bases and supply
and reports further that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“The Fuehrer is at present occupied with the question of
the occupation of the Atlantic islands with a view to the
prosecution of war against America at a later date. Deliberations
on this subject are being embarked upon here.”
(<span class='it'>376-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On December 7, 1941, a day which the late President Roosevelt
declared “will live in infamy,” victory for German aggression
seemed certain. The Wehrmacht was at the gates of Moscow.
Taking advantage of the situation, and while her plenipotentiaries
were creating a diplomatic diversion in Washington, Japan
without declaration of war treacherously attacked the United
States at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines. Attacks followed
swiftly on the British Commonwealth and The Netherlands in
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
the Southwest Pacific. These aggressions were met in the only
way they could be met, with instant declarations of war and with
armed resistance which mounted slowly through many long
months of reverse until finally the Axis was crushed to earth
and deliverance for its victims was won.</p>

<h4>CRIMES IN THE CONDUCT OF WAR</h4>

<p class='pindent'>Even the most warlike of peoples have recognized in the name
of humanity some limitations on the savagery of warfare. Rules
to that end have been embodied in international conventions to
which Germany became a party. This code had prescribed certain
restraints as to the treatment of belligerents. The enemy was
entitled to surrender and to receive quarter and good treatment
as a prisoner of war. We will show by German documents that
these rights were denied, that prisoners of war were given brutal
treatment and often murdered. This was particularly true in the
case of captured airmen, often my countrymen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was ordered that captured English and American airmen
should no longer be granted the status of prisoners of war. They
were to be treated as criminals and the Army was ordered to refrain
from protecting them against lynching by the populace
(<span class='it'>R-118</span>). The Nazi Government, through its police and propaganda
agencies, took pains to incite the civilian population to
attack and kill airmen who crash-landed. The order, given by the
Reichsfuehrer SS, Himmler, on 10 August 1943, directed that,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not the task of the police to interfere in clashes
between German and English and American fliers who have
bailed out.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This order was transmitted on the same day by SS Obersturmbannfuhrer
Brand of Himmler’s Personal Staff to all Senior Executive
SS and Police officers, with these directions:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sending you the inclosed order with the request that
the Chief of the Regular Police and of the Security Police be
informed. They are to make this instruction known to their
subordinate officers verbally.” (<span class='it'>R-110</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Similarly, we will show Hitler’s top secret order, dated 18 October
1942, that commandos, regardless of condition, were “to be
slaughtered to the last man” after capture (<span class='it'>498-PS</span>). We will
show the circulation of secret orders, one of which was signed by
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
Hess, to be passed orally to civilians, that enemy fliers or parachutists
were to be arrested or liquidated (<span class='it'>062-PS</span>). By such
means were murders incited and directed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Nazi campaign of ruthless treatment of enemy forces assumed
its greatest proportions in the fight against Russia.
Eventually all prisoners of war were taken out of control of the
Army and put in the hands of Himmler and the SS (<span class='it'>058-PS</span>). In
the East, the German fury spent itself. Russian prisoners were ordered
to be branded. They were starved. I shall quote passages
from a letter written February 28, 1942 by defendant Rosenberg
to defendant Keitel:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“The fate of the Soviet prisoners of war in Germany is
on the contrary a tragedy of the greatest extent. Of 3.6 millions
of prisoners of war, only several hundred thousand are
still able to work fully. A large part of them has starved,
or died, because of the hazards of the weather. Thousands
also died from spotted fever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The camp commanders have forbidden the civilian population
to put food at the disposal of the prisoners, and they
have rather let them starve to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In many cases, when prisoners of war could no longer keep
up on the march because of hunger and exhaustion, they
were shot before the eyes of the horrified civilian population,
and the corpses were left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In numerous camps, no shelter for the prisoners of war
was provided at all. They lay under the open sky during
rain or snow. Even tools were not made available to dig
holes or caves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finally, the shooting of prisoners of war must be mentioned.
For instance, in various camps, all the ‘Asiatics’
were shot.” (<span class='it'>081-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Civilized usage and conventions to which Germany was a party
had prescribed certain immunities for civilian populations unfortunate
enough to dwell in lands overrun by hostile armies. The
German occupation forces, controlled or commanded by men on
trial before you, committed a long series of outrages against the
inhabitants of occupied territory that would be incredible except
for captured orders and the captured reports showing the fidelity
with which these orders were executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We deal here with a phase of common criminality designed by
the conspirators as part of the common plan. We can appreciate
why these crimes against their European enemies were not of a
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
casual character but were planned and disciplined crimes when
we get at the reason for them. Hitler told his officers on August
22, 1939 that “The main objective in Poland is the destruction of
the enemy and not the reaching of a certain geographical line.”
(<span class='it'>1014-PS</span>). The project of deporting promising youth from occupied
territories was approved by Rosenberg on the theory that
“a desired weakening of the biological force of the conquered
people is being achieved.” (<span class='it'>031-PS</span>). To Germanize or to destroy
was the program. Himmler announced, “Either we win over
any good blood that we can use for ourselves and give it a place in
our people or, gentlemen—you may call this cruel, but nature is
cruel—we destroy this blood.” As to “racially good types” Himmler
further advised, “Therefore, I think that it is our duty to take
their children with us to remove them from their environment if
necessary by robbing or stealing them.” (<span class='it'>L-70</span>). He urged deportation
of Slavic children to deprive potential enemies of future
soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi purpose was to leave Germany’s neighbors so weakened
that even if she should eventually lose the war, she would
still be the most powerful nation in Europe. Against this background,
we must view the plan for ruthless warfare, which means
a plan for the commission of war crimes and crimes against
humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hostages in large numbers were demanded and killed. Mass
punishments were inflicted, so savage that whole communities
were extinguished. Rosenberg was advised of the annihilation
of three unidentified villages in Slovakia. In May of 1943, another
village of about 40 farms and 220 inhabitants was ordered wiped
out. The entire population was ordered shot, the cattle and
property impounded, and the order required that “the village
will be destroyed totally by fire.” A secret report from Rosenberg’s
Reich Ministry of Eastern territory reveals that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Food rations allowed the Russian population are so low
that they fail to secure their existence and provide only for
minimum subsistence of limited duration. The population,
does not know if they will still live tomorrow. They are
faced with death by starvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The roads are clogged by hundreds of thousands of
people, sometime as many as one million according to the
estimate of experts, who wander around in search of nourishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sauckel’s action has caused great unrest among the civilians.
Russian girls were deloused by men, nude photos in
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
forced positions were taken, women doctors were locked
into freight cars for the pleasure of the transport commanders,
women in night shirts were fettered and forced
through the Russian towns to the railroad station, etc. All
this material has been sent to the OKH.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the deportation to slave labor was the most horrible
and extensive slaving operation in history. On few other subjects
is our evidence so abundant or so damaging. In a speech
made on January 25, 1944, the defendant Frank, Governor-General
of Poland, boasted, “I have sent 1,300,000 Polish workers into
the Reich.” The defendant Sauckel reported that “out of the five
million foreign workers who arrived in Germany not even 200,000
came voluntarily.” This fact was reported to the Fuehrer
and defendants Speer, Goering, and Keitel (<span class='it'>R-124</span>). Children
of 10 to 14 years were impressed into service by telegraphic order
of Rosenberg’s Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“The Command is further charged with the transferring
of worthwhile Russian youth between 10-14 years of age,
to the Reich. The authority is not affected by the changes
connected with the evacuation and transportation to the reception
camps of Pialystok, Krajewo, and Olitei. The Fuehrer
wishes that this activity be increased even more.” (<span class='it'>200-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>When enough labor was not forthcoming, prisoners of war were
forced in war work in flagrant violation of international conventions
(<span class='it'>016-PS</span>). Slave labor came from France, Belgium, Holland,
Italy, and the East. Methods of recruitment were violent
(<span class='it'>R-124, 018-PS, 204-PS</span>). The treatment of these slave laborers
was stated in general terms, not difficult to translate into concrete
deprivations, in a letter to the defendant Rosenberg from the defendant
Sauckel, which stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“All <span class='it'>prisoners of war</span>, from the <span class='it'>territories</span> of the West as
well of the East, actually in Germany, must be completely
incorporated into the German armament and munition industries.
Their production must be brought to the highest
possible level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The complete employment of all prisoners of war as well
as the use of a gigantic number of new foreign civilian workers,
men and women, has become an undisputable necessity
for the solution of the mobilization of labor program in this
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the men must be fed, sheltered and treated in such
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
a way as to exploit them to the highest possible extent at
the lowest conceivable degrees of expenditure.” (<span class='it'>016-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In pursuance of the Nazi plan permanently to reduce the living
standards of their neighbors and to weaken them physically
and economically, a long series of crimes were committed. There
was extensive destruction, serving no military purpose, of the
property of civilians. Dikes were thrown open in Holland almost
at the close of the war not to achieve military ends but to destroy
the resources and retard the economy of the thrifty Netherlanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was carefully planned economic syphoning off of the
assets of occupied countries. An example of the planning is
shown by a report on France dated December 7, 1942 made by
the Economic Research Department of the Reichsbank. The question
arose whether French occupation costs should be increased
from 15 million Reichsmarks per day to 25 million Reichsmarks
per day. The Reichsbank analyzed French economy to determine
whether it could bear the burden. It pointed out that the
armistice had burdened France to that date to the extent of 18½
billion Reichsmarks, equalling 370 billion Francs. It pointed out
that the burden of these payments within two and a half years
equalled the aggregate French national income in the year 1940,
and that the amount of payments handed over to Germany in the
first six months of 1942 corresponded to the estimate for the total
French revenue for that whole year. The report concluded, “In
any case, the conclusion is inescapable that relatively heavier
tributes have been imposed on France since the armistice in
June, 1940 than upon Germany after the World War. In this
connection, it must be noted that the economic powers of France
never equalled those of the German Reich and that vanquished
France could not draw on foreign economic and financial resources
in the same degree as Germany after the last World
War.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant Funk was the Reichs Minister of Economics and
President of the Reichsbank; the defendant Ribbentrop was Foreign
Minister; the defendant Goering was Plenipotentiary for
the Four-Year Plan, and all of them participated in the exchange
of views of which this captured document is a part (<span class='it'>2149-PS</span>).
Notwithstanding this analysis by the Reichsbank, they proceeded
to increase the imposition on France from 15 million Reichsmarks
daily to 25 million daily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is small wonder that the bottom has been knocked out of
French economy. The plan and purpose of the thing appears in
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
a letter from General Stulpnagle, head of the German Armistice
Commission, to the defendant Jodl as early as 14th September,
1940 when he wrote, “The slogan ‘Systematic weakening of
France’ has already been surpassed by far in reality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not only was there a purpose to debilitate and demoralize the
economy of Germany’s neighbors for the purpose of destroying
their competitive position, but there was looting and pilfering on
an unprecedented scale. We need not be hypocritical about this
business of looting. I recognize that no army moves through occupied
territory without some pilfering as it goes. Usually the
amount of pilfering increases as discipline wanes. If the evidence
in this case showed no looting except of that sort, I certainly
would ask no conviction of these defendants for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we will show you that looting was not due to the lack of
discipline or to the ordinary weaknesses of human nature. The
German organized plundering, planned it, disciplined it, and made
it official just as he organized everything else, and then he compiled
the most meticulous records to show that he had done the
best job of looting that was possible under the circumstances.
And we have those records.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant Rosenberg was put in charge of a systematic
plundering of the art objects of Europe by direct order of Hitler
dated 29 January 1940 (<span class='it'>136-PS</span>). On the 16th of April, 1943
Rosenberg reported that up to the 7th of April, 92 railway cars
with 2,775 cases containing art objects had been sent to Germany;
and that 53 pieces of art had been shipped to Hitler direct,
and 594 to the defendant Goering. The report mentioned
something like 20,000 pieces of seized art and the main locations
where they were stored (<span class='it'>015-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, this looting was glorified by Rosenberg. Here we
have 39 leather-bound tabulated volumes of his inventory, which
in due time we will offer in evidence. One cannot but admire the
artistry of this Rosenberg report. The Nazi taste was cosmopolitan.
Of the 9,455 articles inventoried, there were included 5,255
paintings, 297 sculptures, 1,372 pieces of antique furniture, 307
textiles, and 2,224 small objects of art. Rosenberg observed that
there were approximately 10,000 more objects still to be inventoried
(<span class='it'>015-PS</span>). Rosenberg himself estimated that the values
involved would come close to a billion dollars (<span class='it'>090-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not go into further details of the war crimes and
crimes against humanity committed by the Nazi gangster ring
whose leaders are before you. It is not the purpose in my part of
this case to deal with the individual crimes. I am dealing with
the common plan or design for crime and will not dwell upon individual
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
offenses. My task is only to show the scale on which
these crimes occurred, and to show that these are the men who
were in the responsible positions and who conceived the plan and
design which renders them answerable, regardless of the fact
that the plan was actually executed by others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, this reckless and lawless course outraged the world.
It recovered from the demoralization of surprise attack, assembled
its forces, and stopped these men in their tracks. Once success
deserted their banners, one by one the Nazi satellites fell away.
Sawdust Caesar collapsed. Resistance forces in every occupied
country arose to harry the invader. Even at home, Germans saw
that Germany was being led to ruin by these mad men, and the
attempt on July 20, 1944 to assassinate Hitler, an attempt
fostered by men of highest station, was a desperate effort by internal
forces to stop short of ruin. Quarrels broke out among the
failing conspirators, and the decline of the Nazi power was more
swift than its ascendancy. German armed forces surrendered, its
government disintegrated, its leaders committed suicide by the
dozen, and by the fortunes of war these defendants fell into our
hands. Although they are not by any means all the guilty ones,
they are survivors among the most responsible. Their names appear
over and over in the documents and their faces grace the
photographic evidence. We have here the surviving top politicians,
militarists, financiers, diplomats, administrators, and
propagandists of the Nazi movement. Who was responsible for
these crimes if they were not?</p>

<h4>THE LAW OF THE CASE</h4>

<p class='pindent'>The end of the war and capture of these prisoners presented
the victorious Allies with the question whether there is any legal
responsibility on high-ranking men for acts which I have described.
Must such wrongs either be ignored or redressed in hot
blood? Is there no standard in the law for a deliberate and reasoned
judgment on such conduct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter of this Tribunal evidences a faith that the law is
not only to govern the conduct of little men, but that even rulers
are, as Lord Chief Justice Coke put it to King James, “under God
and the law.” The United States believed that the law long has
afforded standards by which a juridical hearing could be conducted
to make sure that we punish only the right men and for
the right reasons. Following the instructions of the late President
Roosevelt and the decision of the Yalta conference, President
Truman directed representatives of the United States to
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
formulate a proposed International Agreement, which was submitted
during the San Francisco Conference to Foreign Ministers
of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the Provisional
Government of France. With many modifications, that proposal
has become the Charter of this Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Agreement which sets up the standards by which these
prisoners are to be judged does not express the views of the
signatory nations alone. Other nations with diverse but highly
respected systems of jurisprudence also have signified adherence
to it. These are Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, Norway,
Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg, Poland, Greece, Yugoslavia, Ethiopia,
Australia, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, New Zealand, Venezuela,
and India. You judge, therefore, under an organic act
which represents the wisdom, the sense of justice, and the will of
twenty-one governments, representing an overwhelming majority
of all civilized people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter by which this Tribunal has its being embodies
certain legal concepts which are inseparable from its jurisdiction
and which must govern its decision. These, as I have said, also
are conditions attached to the grant of any hearing to defendants.
The validity of the provisions of the Charter is conclusive upon
us all whether we have accepted the duty of judging or of prosecuting
under it, as well as upon the defendants, who can point to
no other law which gives them a right to be heard at all. My able
and experienced colleagues believe, as do I, that it will contribute
to the expedition and clarity of this trial if I expound briefly the
application of the legal philosophy of the Charter to the facts I
have recited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While this declaration of the law by the Charter is final, it may
be contended that the prisoners on trial are entitled to have it
applied to their conduct only most charitably if at all. It may be
said that this is new law, not authoritatively declared at the time
they did the acts it condemns, and that this declaration of the law
has taken them by surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot, of course, deny that these men are surprised that this
is the law; they really are surprised that there is any such thing
as law. These defendants did not rely on any law at all. Their
program ignored and defied all law. That this is so will appear
from many acts and statements, of which I cite but a few. In the
Fuehrer’s speech to all military commanders on November 23,
1939, he reminded them that at the moment Germany had a pact
with Russia, but declared, “Agreements are to be kept only as
long as they serve a certain purpose.” Later on in the same
speech he announced, “A violation of the neutrality of Holland
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
and Belgium will be of no importance.” (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>). A Top Secret
document, entitled “Warfare as a Problem of Organization,” dispatched
by the Chief of the High Command to all Commanders
on April 19, 1938, declared that “the normal rules of war toward
neutrals may be considered to apply on the basis whether operation
of rules will create greater advantages or disadvantages for
belligerents.” (<span class='it'>L-211</span>). And from the files of the German Navy
Staff, we have a “Memorandum on Intensified Naval War,” dated
October 15, 1939, which begins by stating a desire to comply
with International Law. “However,” it continues, “if decisive
successes are expected from any measure considered as a war
necessity, it must be carried through even if it is not in agreement
with international law.” (<span class='it'>UK-65</span>). International Law, natural
law, German law, any law at all was to these men simply a
propaganda device to be invoked when it helped and to be ignored
when it would condemn what they wanted to do. That men may
be protected in relying upon the law at the time they act is the
reason we find laws of retrospective operation unjust. But these
men cannot bring themselves within the reason of the rule which
in some systems of jurisprudence prohibits <span class='it'>ex post facto</span> laws.
They cannot show that they ever relied upon International Law
in any state or paid it the slightest regard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Third Count of the Indictment is based on the definition
of war crimes contained in the Charter. I have outlined to you
the systematic course of conduct toward civilian populations and
combat forces which violates international conventions to which
Germany was a party. Of the criminal nature of these acts at
least, the defendants had, as we shall show, clear knowledge.
Accordingly, they took pains to conceal their violations. It will
appear that the defendants Keitel and Jodl were informed by
official legal advisors that the orders to brand Russian prisoners
of war, to shackle British prisoners of war, and to execute commando
prisoners were clear violations of International Law.
Nevertheless, these orders were put into effect. The same is
true of orders issued for the assassination of General Giraud
and General Weygand, which failed to be executed only because
of a ruse on the part of Admiral Canaris, who was himself later
executed for his part in the plot to take Hitler’s life on July 20,
1944 (<span class='it'>Affidavit A</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fourth Count of the Indictment is based on crimes against
humanity. Chief among these are mass killings of countless
human beings in cold blood. Does it take these men by surprise
that murder is treated as a crime?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The First and Second Counts of the Indictment add to these
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
crimes the crime of plotting and waging wars of aggression and
wars in violation of nine treaties to which Germany was a party.
There was a time, in fact I think the time of the first World
War, when it could not have been said that war-inciting or war-making
was a crime in law, however reprehensible in morals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, it was under the law of all civilized peoples a crime
for one man with his bare knuckles to assault another. How did
it come that multiplying this crime by a million, and adding fire
arms to bare knuckles, made a legally innocent act? The doctrine
was that one could not be regarded as criminal for committing
the usual violent acts in the conduct of legitimate warfare. The
age of imperialistic expansion during the Eighteenth and Nineteenth
Centuries added the foul doctrine, contrary to the teachings
of early Christian and International Law scholars such as
Grotius, that all wars are to be regarded as legitimate wars. The
sum of these two doctrines was to give war-making a complete
immunity from accountability to law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was intolerable for an age that called itself civilized.
Plain people, with their earthly common sense, revolted at such
fictions and legalisms so contrary to ethical principles and demanded
checks on war immunity. Statesmen and international
lawyers at first cautiously responded by adopting rules of warfare
designed to make the conduct of war more civilized. The
effort was to set legal limits to the violence that could be done to
civilian populations and to combatants as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The common sense of men after the First World War demanded,
however, that the law’s condemnation of war reach
deeper, and that the law condemn not merely uncivilized ways of
waging war, but also the waging in any way of uncivilized wars—wars
of aggression. The world’s statesmen again went only
as far as they were forced to go. Their efforts were timid and
cautious and often less explicit than we might have hoped. But
the 1920’s did outlaw aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reestablishment of the principle that there are unjust wars
and that unjust wars are illegal is traceable in many steps. One
of the most significant is the Briand-Kellogg Pact of 1928, by
which Germany, Italy, and Japan, in common with practically
all the nations of the world, renounced war as an instrument of
national policy, bound themselves to seek the settlement of disputes
only by pacific means, and condemned recourse to war for
the solution of international controversies. This pact altered
the legal status of a war of aggression. As Mr. Stimson, the
United States Secretary of State put it in 1932, such a war “is
no longer to be the source and subject of rights. It is no longer
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
to be the principle around which the duties, the conduct, and
the rights of nations revolve. It is an illegal thing. * * * By
that very act, we have made obsolete many legal precedents and
have given the legal profession the task of reexamining many of
its codes and treaties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Geneva Protocol of 1924 for the Pacific Settlement of International
Disputes, signed by the representatives of forty-eight
governments, declared that “a war of aggression constitutes
* * * an international crime.” The Eighth Assembly of the
League of Nations in 1927, on unanimous resolution of the representatives
of forty-eight member nations, including Germany,
declared that a war of aggression constitutes an international
crime. At the Sixth Pan-American Conference of 1928, the
twenty-one American Republics unanimously adopted a resolution
stating that “war of aggression constitutes an international crime
against the human species.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A failure of these Nazis to heed, or to understand the force and
meaning of this evolution in the legal thought of the world is not
a defense or a mitigation. If anything, it aggravates their offense
and makes it the more mandatory that the law they have
flouted be vindicated by juridical application to their lawless
conduct. Indeed, by their own law—had they heeded any law—these
principles were binding on these defendants. Article 4 of
the Weimar Constitution provided that “The generally accepted
rules of international law are to be considered as binding integral
parts of the law of the German Reich.” (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>). Can there be
any doubt that the outlawry of aggressive war was one of the
“generally accepted rules of international law” in 1939?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any resort to war—to any kind of a war—is a resort to means
that are inherently criminal. War inevitably is a course of killings,
assaults, deprivations of liberty, and destruction of property.
An honestly defensive war is, of course, legal and saves
those lawfully conducting it from criminality. But inherently
criminal acts cannot be defended by showing that those who committed
them were engaged in a war, when war itself is illegal.
The very minimum legal consequence of the treaties making aggressive
wars illegal is to strip those who incite or wage them of
every defense the law ever gave, and to leave warmakers subject
to judgment by the usually accepted principles of the law of
crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if it be thought that the Charter, whose declarations concededly
bind us all, does contain new law I still do not shrink
from demanding its strict application by this Tribunal. The rule
of law in the world, flouted by the lawlessness incited by these
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
defendants, had to be restored at the cost to my country of over
a million casualties, not to mention those of other nations. I cannot
subscribe to the perverted reasoning that society may advance
and strengthen the rule of law by the expenditure of
morally innocent lives but that progress in the law may never be
made at the price of morally guilty lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is true, of course, that we have no judicial precedent for the
Charter. But International Law is more than a scholarly collection
of abstract and immutable principles. It is an outgrowth of
treaties and agreements between nations and of accepted customs.
Yet every custom has its origin in some single act, and
every agreement has to be initiated by the action of some state.
Unless we are prepared to abandon every principle of growth for
International Law, we cannot deny that our own day has the
right to institute customs and to conclude agreements that will
themselves become sources of a newer and strengthened International
Law. International Law is not capable of development
by the normal processes of legislation for there is no continuing
international legislative authority. Innovations and revisions in
International Law are brought about by the action of governments
designed to meet a change in circumstances. It grows, as
did the Common Law, through decisions reached from time to
time in adapting settled principles to new situations. The fact is
that when the law evolves by the case method, as did the Common
Law and as International Law must do if it is to advance
at all, it advances at the expense of those who wrongly guessed
the law and learned too late their error. The law, so far as International
Law can be decreed, had been clearly pronounced when
these acts took place. Hence, I am not disturbed by the lack of
judicial precedent for the inquiry we propose to conduct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The events I have earlier recited clearly fall within the standards
of crimes, set out in the Charter, whose perpetrators this
Tribunal is convened to judge and punish fittingly. The standards
for war crimes and crimes against humanity are too familiar
to need comment. There are, however, certain novel problems in
applying other precepts of the Charter which I should call to your
attention.</p>

<h4>THE CRIME AGAINST PEACE</h4>

<p class='pindent'>A basic provision of the Charter is that to plan, prepare, initiate,
or wage a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international
treaties, agreements, and assurances, or to conspire or
participate in a common plan to do so is a crime.
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is perhaps a weakness in this Charter that it fails itself to
define a war of aggression. Abstractly, the subject is full of difficulty
and all kinds of troublesome hypothetical cases can be conjured
up. It is a subject which, if the defense should be permitted
to go afield beyond the very narrow charge in the Indictment,
would prolong the trial and involve the Tribunal in insoluble
political issues. But so far as the question can properly
be involved in this case, the issue is one of no novelty and is one
on which legal opinion has well crystalized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most authoritative sources of International Law on
this subject is the Convention for the Definition of Aggression
signed at London on July 3, 1933 by Rumania, Estonia, Latvia,
Poland, Turkey, The Soviet Union, Persia, and Afghanistan. The
subject has also been considered by international committees and
by commentators whose views are entitled to the greatest respect.
It had been little discussed prior to the First World War
but has received much attention as International Law has evolved
its outlawry of aggressive war. In the light of these materials
of International Law, and so far as relevant to the evidence in this
case, I suggest that an “aggressor” is generally held to be that
state which is the first to commit any of the following actions:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Declaration of war upon another State;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) Invasion by its armed forces, with or without a declaration
war, of the territory of another State;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) Attack by its land, naval, or air forces, with or without
a declaration of war, on the territory, vessels, or aircraft of
another State;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) Provision of support to armed bands formed in the
territory of another State, or refusal, notwithstanding the
request of the invaded State, to take in its own territory, all
the measures in its power to deprive those bands of all assistance
or protection.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And I further suggest that it is the general view that no political,
military, economic or other considerations shall serve as an excuse
or justification for such actions; but exercise of the right of
legitimate self-defense, that is to say, resistance to an act of
aggression, or action to assist a State which has been subjected
to aggression, shall not constitute a war of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is upon such an understanding of the law that our evidence
of a conspiracy to provoke and wage an aggressive war is prepared
and presented. By this test each of the series of wars begun
by these Nazi leaders was unambiguously aggressive.
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is important to the duration and scope of this trial that we
bear in mind the difference between our charge that this war
was one of aggression and a position that Germany had no
grievances. We are not inquiring into the conditions which contributed
to causing this war. They are for history to unravel. It
is no part of our task to vindicate the European <span class='it'>status quo</span> as of
1933, or as of any other date. The United States does not desire
to enter into discussion of the complicated pre-war currents of
European politics, and it hopes this trial will not be protracted
by their consideration. The remote causations avowed are too
insincere and inconsistent, too complicated and doctrinaire to be
the subject of profitable inquiry in this trial. A familiar example
is to be found in the <span class='it'>Lebensraum</span> slogan, which summarized the
contention that Germany needed more living space as a justification
for expansion. At the same time that the Nazis were demanding
more space for the German people, they were demanding
more German people to occupy space. Every known
means to increase the birth rate, legitimate and illegitimate, was
utilized. <span class='it'>Lebensraum</span> represented a vicious circle of demand—from
neighbors more space, and from Germans more progeny.
We do not need to investigate the verity of doctrines which led
to constantly expanding circles of aggression. It is the plot and
the act of aggression which we charge to be crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our position is that whatever grievances a nation may have,
however objectionable it finds the <span class='it'>status quo</span>, aggressive warfare
is an illegal means for settling those grievances or for altering
those conditions. It may be that the Germany of the 1920’s and
1930’s faced desperate problems, problems that would have warranted
the boldest measures short of war. All other methods—persuasion,
propaganda, economic competition, diplomacy—were
open to an aggrieved country, but aggressive warfare was outlawed.
These defendants did make aggressive war, a war in
violation of treaties. They did attack and invade their neighbors
in order to effectuate a foreign policy which they knew could not
be accomplished by measures short of war. And that is as far as
we accuse or propose to inquire.</p>

<h4>THE LAW OF INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY</h4>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter also recognizes individual responsibility on the
part of those who commit acts defined as crimes, or who incite
others to do so, or who join a common plan with other persons,
groups or organizations to bring about their commission. The
principle of individual responsibility for piracy and brigandage,
which have long been recognized as crimes punishable under International
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
Law, is old and well established. That is what illegal
warfare is. This principle of personal liability is a necessary as
well as logical one if International Law is to render real help to
the maintenance of peace. An International Law which operates
only on states can be enforced only by war because the most practicable
method of coercing a state is warfare. Those familiar with
American history know that one of the compelling reasons for
adoption of our Constitution was that the laws of the Confederation,
which operated only on constituent states, were found ineffective
to maintain order among them. The only answer to recalcitrance
was impotence or war. Only sanctions which reach
individuals can peacefully and effectively be enforced. Hence, the
principle of the criminality of aggressive war is implemented by
the Charter with the principle of personal responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, the idea that a state, any more than a corporation,
commits crimes is a fiction. Crimes always are committed only by
persons. While it is quite proper to employ the fiction of responsibility
of a state or corporation for the purpose of imposing a collective
liability, it is quite intolerable to let such a legalism become
the basis of personal immunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter recognizes that one who has committed criminal
acts may not take refuge in superior orders nor in the doctrine
that his crimes were acts of states. These twin principles working
together have heretofore resulted in immunity for practically
everyone concerned in the really great crimes against peace and
mankind. Those in lower ranks were protected against liability by
the orders of their superiors. The superiors were protected because
their orders were called acts of state. Under the Charter,
no defense based on either of these doctrines can be entertained.
Modern civilization puts unlimited weapons of destruction in the
hands of men. It cannot tolerate so vast an area of legal irresponsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the German Military Code provides that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“If the execution of a military order in the course of duty
violates the criminal law, then the superior officer giving the
order will bear the sole responsibility therefor. However, the
obeying subordinate will share the punishment of the participant:
(1) if he has exceeded the order given to him, or
(2) if it was within his knowledge that the order of his superior
officer concerned an act by which it was intended to
commit a civil or military crime or transgression.” (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
1926, No. 37, p. 278, Art. 47).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, we do not argue that the circumstances under which
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
one commits an act should be disregarded in judging its legal effect.
A conscripted private on a firing squad cannot expect to hold
an inquest on the validity of the execution. The Charter implies
common sense limits to liability just as it places common sense
limits upon immunity. But none of these men before you acted in
minor parts. Each of them was entrusted with broad discretion
and exercised great power. Their responsibility is correspondingly
great and may not be shifted to that fictional being, “the
State”, which can not be produced for trial, can not testify, and
can not be sentenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter also recognized a vicarious liability, which responsibility
is recognized by most modern systems of law, for acts
committed by others in carrying out a common plan or conspiracy
to which a defendant has become a party. I need not discuss
the familiar principles of such liability. Every day in the
courts of countries associated in this, prosecution, men are convicted
for acts that they did not personally commit but for which
they were held responsible because of membership in illegal combinations
or plans or conspiracies.</p>

<h4>THE POLITICAL, POLICE, AND MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS</h4>

<p class='pindent'>Accused before this Tribunal as criminal organizations are
certain political and police organizations which the evidence will
show to have been instruments of cohesion in planning and executing
the crimes I have detailed. Perhaps the worst of the movement
were the Leadership Corps of the NSDAP, the Schutzstaffeln
or “SS”, and the Sturmabteilungen or “SA”, and the
subsidiary formations which these include. These were the Nazi
Party leadership, espionage, and policing groups. They were the
real government, above and outside of any law. Also accused as
organizations are the Reich Cabinet and the Secret State Police
or Gestapo, which were fixtures of the Government but animated
solely by the Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except for a late period when some compulsory recruiting was
done in the SS, membership in all these militarized formations
was voluntary. The police organizations were recruited from ardent
partisans who enlisted blindly to do the dirty work the leaders
planned. The Reich Cabinet was the governmental facade
for Nazi Party Government and in its members legal as well as
actual responsibility was vested for the entire program. Collectively
they were responsible for the program in general, individually
they were especially responsible for segments of it. The
finding which we ask you to make, that these are criminal organizations,
will subject members to punishment to be hereafter
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
determined by appropriate tribunals, unless some personal defense—such
as becoming a member under threat to person, to
family, or inducement by false representation, or the like—be
established. Every member will have a chance to be heard in the
subsequent forum on his personal relation to the organization,
but your finding in this trial will conclusively establish the criminal
character of the organization as a whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have also accused as criminal organizations the High Command
and the General Staff of the German Armed Forces. We
recognize that to plan warfare is the business of professional
soldiers in every country. But it is one thing to plan strategic
moves in the event war comes, and it is another thing to plot and
intrigue to bring on that war. We will prove the leaders of the
German General Staff and of the High Command to have been
guilty of just that. Military men are not before you because they
served their country. They are here because they mastered it,
along with these others, and drove it to war. They are not here
because they lost the war but because they started it. Politicians
may have thought of them as soldiers, but soldiers know they
were politicians. We ask that the General Staff and the High
Command, as defined in the Indictment, be condemned as a
criminal group whose existence and tradition constitute a standing
menace to the peace of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These individual defendants did not stand alone in crime and
will not stand alone in punishment. Your verdict of “guilty”
against these organizations will render <span class='it'>prima facie</span> guilty, as
nearly as we can learn, thousands upon thousands of members
now in custody of United States forces and of other Armies.</p>

<h4>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS TRIBUNAL</h4>

<p class='pindent'>To apply the sanctions of the law to those whose conduct is
found criminal by the standards I have outlined, is the responsibility
committed to this Tribunal. It is the first court ever to
undertake the difficult task of overcoming the confusion of many
tongues and the conflicting concepts of just procedure among divers
systems of law, so as to reach a common judgment. The
tasks of all of us are such as to make heavy demands on patience
and good will. Although the need for prompt action has admittedly
resulted in imperfect work on the part of the prosecution,
four great nations bring you their hurriedly assembled contributions
of evidence. What remains undiscovered we can only
guess. We could, with witnesses’ testimony, prolong the recitals
of crime for years—but to what avail? We shall rest the case
when we have offered what seems convincing and adequate proof
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
of the crimes charged without unnecessary cumulation of evidence.
We doubt very much whether it will be seriously denied
that the crimes I have outlined took place. The effort will undoubtedly
be to mitigate or escape personal responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the nations which unite in accusing these defendants
the United States is perhaps in a position to be the most dispassionate,
for, having sustained the least injury, it is perhaps the
least animated by vengeance. Our American cities have not been
bombed by day and night, by humans and by robots. It is not
our temples that have been laid in ruins. Our countrymen have
not had their homes destroyed over their heads. The menace of
Nazi aggression, except to those in actual service, has seemed
less personal and immediate to us than to European peoples. But
while the United States is not first in rancor, it is not second in
determination that the forces of law and order be made equal
to the task of dealing with such international lawlessness as I
have recited here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twice in my lifetime, the United States has sent its young
manhood across the Atlantic, drained its resources, and burdened
itself with debt to help defeat Germany. But the real hope and
faith that has sustained the American people in these great efforts
was that victory for ourselves and our Allies would lay the
basis for an ordered international relationship in Europe and
would end the centuries of strife on this embattled continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twice we have held back in the early stages of European conflict
in the belief that it might be confined to a purely European
affair. In the United States, we have tried to build an economy
without armament, a system of government without militarism,
and a society where men are not regimented for war. This purpose,
we know now, can never be realized if the world periodically
is to be embroiled in war. The United States cannot, generation
after generation, throw its youth or its resources onto the
battlefields of Europe to redress the lack of balance between Germany’s
strength and that of her enemies, and to keep the battles
from our shores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American dream of a peace and plenty economy, as well as
the hopes of other nations, can never be fulfilled if those nations
are involved in a war every generation so vast and devastating
as to crush the generation that fights and burden the generation
that follows. But experience has shown that wars are no longer
local. All modern wars become world wars eventually. And none
of the big nations at least can stay out. If we cannot stay out
of wars, our only hope is to prevent wars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am too well aware of the weaknesses of juridical action alone
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
to contend that in itself your decision under this Charter can prevent
future wars. Judicial action always comes after the event.
Wars are started only on the theory and in the confidence that
they can be won. Personal punishment, to be suffered only in
the event the war is lost, will probably not be a sufficient deterrent
to prevent a war where the warmakers feel the chances of defeat
to be negligible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the ultimate step in avoiding periodic wars, which are inevitable
in a system of international lawlessness, is to make
statesmen responsible to law. And let me make clear that while
this law is first applied against German aggressors, the law includes,
and if it is to serve a useful purpose it must condemn aggression
by any other nations, including those which sit here now
in judgment. We are able to do away with domestic tyranny and
violence and aggression by those in power against the rights of
their own people only when we make all men answerable to the
law. This trial represents mankind’s desperate effort to apply
the discipline of the law to statesmen who have used their powers
of state to attack the foundations of the world’s peace and to
commit aggressions against the rights of their neighbors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The usefulness of this effort to do justice is not to be measured
by considering the law or your judgment in isolation. This trial
is part of the great effort to make the peace more secure. One
step in this direction is the United Nations organization, which
may take joint political action to prevent war if possible, and
joint military action to insure that any nation which starts a war
will lose it. This Charter and this trial, implementing the Kellogg-Briand
Pact, constitute another step in the same direction—juridical
action of a kind to ensure that those who start a war
will pay for it personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the defendants and the prosecutors stand before you as
individuals, it is not the triumph of either group alone that is
committed to your judgment. Above all personalities there are
anonymous and impersonal forces whose conflict makes up much
of human history. It is yours to throw the strength of the law
back of either the one or the other of these forces for at least
another generation. What are the real forces that are contending
before you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>No charity can disguise the fact that the forces, which these
defendants represent, the forces that would advantage and delight
in their acquittal, are the darkest and most sinister forces
in society—dictatorship and oppression, malevolence and passion,
militarism and lawlessness. By their fruits we best know them.
Their acts have bathed the world in blood and set civilization
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
back a century. They have subjected their European neighbors
to every outrage and torture, every spoliation and deprivation
that insolence, cruelty, and greed could inflict. They have brought
the German people to the lowest pitch of wretchedness, from
which they can entertain no hope of early deliverance. They
have stirred hatreds and incited domestic violence on every continent.
These are the things that stand in the dock shoulder to
shoulder with these prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The real complaining party at your bar is Civilization. In all
our countries it is still a struggling and imperfect thing. It does
not plead that the United States, or any other country, has been
blameless of the conditions which made the German people easy
victims to the blandishments and intimidations of the Nazi conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it points to the dreadful sequence of aggressions and
crimes I have recited, it points to the weariness of flesh, the
exhaustion of resources, and the destruction of all that was beautiful
or useful in so much of the world, and to greater potentialities
for destruction in the days to come. It is not necessary
among the ruins of this ancient and beautiful city, with untold
members of its civilian inhabitants still buried in its rubble,
to argue the proposition that to start or wage an aggressive war
has the moral qualities of the worst of crimes. The refuge of
the defendants can be only their hope that International Law
will lag so far behind the moral sense of mankind that conduct
which is crime in the moral sense must be regarded as innocent
in law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Civilization asks whether law is so laggard as to be utterly
helpless to deal with crimes of this magnitude by criminals of
this order of importance. It does not expect that you can make
war impossible. It does expect that your juridical action will
put the forces of International Law, its precepts, its prohibitions
and, most of all, its sanctions, on the side of peace, so that
men and women of good will in all countries may have “leave to
live by no man’s leave, underneath the law.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'>I. THE NAZI PARTY</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the opinion of the prosecution, some preliminary references
must be made to the National Socialist German Labor Party,
the NSDAP (<span class='it'>Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</span>)
which is not itself one of the defendant organizations in this proceeding,
but which is represented among the defendant organizations
by its most important formations, viz., the Leadership Corps
of the Nazi Party (<span class='it'>Das Korps der Politischen Leiter der
NSDAP</span>), the SS (<span class='it'>Die Schutzstaffeln der NSDAP</span>), and the SA
(<span class='it'>Die Sturmabteilungen der NSDAP</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prosecution has prepared a chart (<span class='it'>Chart No. 1</span>) showing
the structure and organization of the NSDAP substantially as it
existed at the peak of its development in March 1945. This chart
has been prepared on the basis of information contained in important
publications of the National Socialist Party, with which
the defendants must be presumed to have been well acquainted.
Particular reference is made to the Organization Book of the
Party (<span class='it'>Das Organisationsbuch der NSDAP</span>) and to the National
Socialist Year Book (<span class='it'>Nationalsozialistisches Jahrbuch</span>), of both
of which Robert Ley was publisher. Both books were printed
in many editions and appeared in hundreds of thousands of
copies, throughout the period when the National Socialist party
was in control of the German Reich and of the German people.
This chart has been certified on its face as correct by a high
official of the Nazi party, viz. Franz Xaver Schwarz, its Treasurer
(<span class='it'>Reichsschatzmeister der NSDAP</span>), and its official in charge
of party administration, whose affidavit is submitted with the
chart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certain explanatory remarks concerning the organization of
the National Socialist party may be useful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Leadership Corps of the NSDAP</span>, named as a defendant
organization, comprised the sum of the officials of the Nazi party.
It was divided into seven categories:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Fuehrer</span> was the supreme and only leader who stood at the
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
top of the party hierarchy. His successor designate was first,
Hermann Goering, and second, Rudolf Hess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>, of whom 16 are shown on the chart, made up
the Party Directorate (<span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span>). Through them, coordination
of party and state machinery was assured. A number
of these <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>, each of whom, at some time, was in charge
of at least one office within the Party Directorate, were also the
heads of party formations and of affiliated or supervised organizations
of the party, or of agencies of the state, or even held
ministerial positions. The <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> may be said to have
represented the horizontal organization of the party according
to functions, within which all threads controlling the varied life
of the German people met. Each office within the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span>
of the NSDAP executed definite tasks assigned to it by the
Fuehrer, or by the leader of the Party Chancellory (<span class='it'>Chef der
Parteikanzlei</span>), who in 1945 was Martin Bormann and before
him, Rudolph Hess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the duty of the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> to make certain these
tasks were carried out so that the will of the Fuehrer was
quickly communicated to the lowliest <span class='it'>Zelle</span> or <span class='it'>Block</span>. The individual
offices of the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> had the mission to remain in
constant and closest contact with the life of the people through
the subdivisions of the party organization, in the <span class='it'>Gaue</span>, <span class='it'>Kreisen</span>,
and <span class='it'>Ortsgruppen</span>. These leaders had been taught that the right
to organize human beings accrued through appreciation of the
fact that a people must be educated ideologically (<span class='it'>weltanschaulich</span>),
that is to say, according to the philosophy of National Socialism.
Among the former <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> on trial in this cause are
the following defendants:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Alfred Rosenberg</span>—The delegate to the Fuehrer for Ideological
Training and Education of the Party. (<span class='it'>Der Beauftragte
des Fuehrer’s fuer die Ueberwachung der gesammten
geistigen und weltanschaulichen Schulung und Erziehung
der NSDAP</span>).</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Hans Frank</span>—At one time head of the Legal Office of the
party (<span class='it'>Reichsleiter des Reichsrechtsamtes</span>).</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Baldur von Schirach</span>—Leader of Youth Education (<span class='it'>Leiter
fuer die Jugenderziehung</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and the late</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Robert Ley</span>—Leader of the Party Organization
(<span class='it'>Reichsorganisationsleiter der NSDAP</span>)
and Leader of the German Labor Front
(<span class='it'>Leiter der Deutschen Arbeitsfront</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The next categories to be considered are the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>,
the “bearers of sovereignty.” To them was assigned political sovereignty
over specially designated subdivisions of the state of
which they were the appointed leaders. The <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> may
be said to represent the vertical organization of the party. These
leaders included all:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>a. Gauleiter</span>, of which there were 42 within the Reich in 1945.
A <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> was the political leader of the largest subdivision of
the State. He was charged by the Fuehrer with political, cultural,
and economic control over the life of the people, which he was
to coordinate with the National Socialist ideology. A number of
the defendants before the bar of the Tribunal were former
<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> of the NSDAP. Among them are Julius Streicher
(Franconia) whose seat was in Nurnberg, Baldur von Schirach
(Vienna), and Fritz Sauckel (Thuringia).</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>b. Kreisleiter</span>, the political leaders of the largest subdivision
of a <span class='it'>Gau</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>c. Ortsgruppenleiter</span>, the political leaders of the largest subdivision
of a <span class='it'>Kreis</span> consisting of several towns or villages, or of
a part of a larger city, and including from 1500 to 3000 households.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>d. Zellenleiter</span>, the political leaders of a group of from 4 to 8
city blocks or of a corresponding grouping of households in the
country.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>e. Blockleiter</span>, the political leaders of from 40 to 60 households.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Each of these <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>, or “bearers of sovereignty,” was
directly responsible to the next highest leader in the Nazi hierarchy.
The <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> was directly subordinate to the <span class='it'>Fuehrer</span>
himself, the <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span> was directly subordinate to the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>,
the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span> to the <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>, and so on. The <span class='it'>Fuehrer</span>
himself appointed all <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> and <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>, all <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>,
and all other political leaders within the Party Directorate
(<span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span>) down to the grade of <span class='it'>Gauamtsleiter</span>, the head of a
subdivision of the party organization within a <span class='it'>Gau</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> and <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> together constituted the
all-powerful group of leaders by means of which the Nazi party
reached into the lives of the people, consolidated its control over
them, and compelled them to conform to the National Socialist
pattern. For this purpose, broad powers were given them, including
the right to call upon all party machinery to effectuate
their plans. They could requisition the services of the SA and of
the SS, as well as of the HJ and the NSKK.
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The controlled party organizations (<span class='it'>Gliederungen der NSDAP</span>)
actually constituted the party itself, and substantially the entire
party membership was contained within these organizations,
viz.:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'>SA—NS Storm Troops (<span class='it'>Sturmabteilungen</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were additional affiliated organizations (<span class='it'>Angeschlossene

</div>

<h4>2. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE THIRD REICH</h4>

<p class='pindent'>The prosecution has prepared another chart (<span class='it'>Chart No. 18</span>)
delineating substantially the organizational structure of the government
of the Third Reich, as it existed in March 1945, and
“the chief leadership personnel of the Reich Government and the
Reich Administration during said years.” This chart has been
prepared on the basis of information contained in two well known
official publications: The <span class='it'>Taschenbuch fuer Verwaltungsbeamte</span>,
and the <span class='it'>Nationalsozialistischer Jahrbuch</span>, above-mentioned, of
which Robert Ley was publisher. The chart has been examined,
corrected, and certified by Wilhelm Frick, whose affidavit is submitted
with it. It seems plain that Frick, a former Minister of
Interior of the Reich from January 1933 to August 1943, was well
qualified, by reason of his position and long service in public office
during the National Socialist regime, to certify to the substantial
accuracy of the facts disclosed in this chart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be useful to commence with consideration of the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>,
a word which may not be translated literally as “government
of the Reich.” The word <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> was a word of
art applied collectively to the ministers who composed the German
cabinet. The <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>, which has been named as a
defendant group in this proceeding, includes the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>a.</span> Members of the ordinary cabinet after 30 January 1933,
i.e. Reich ministers with and without portfolio and all other officials
entitled to participate in the meetings of this cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>b.</span> Members of the Council of Ministers for the Defense of the
Reich (<span class='it'>Ministerrat fuer die Reichsverteidigung</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>c.</span> Members of the Secret Cabinet Council (<span class='it'>Geheimer Kabinettsrat</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Unlike the cabinets and ministerial councils in countries not
within the orbit of the former Axis, the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>, after
30 January 1933 when Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of the
German Republic, did not remain merely the executive branch of
the government. In short order it also came to possess, and it
exercised, legislative and other functions in the governmental
system developed under the domination of the National Socialist
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is proper to observe here that, unlike such NS party organizations
as the SS and the SA, the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> before 1933
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
was not a body created exclusively or predominantly for the purpose
of committing illegal acts. The <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> was an instrument
of government provided for by the Weimar Constitution.
Under the Nazi regime, however, the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>
gradually became a primary agent of the party with functions
formulated in accordance with the objectives and methods of
the party. The party was intended to be a <span class='it'>Fuehrerorden</span>, an order
of <span class='it'>Fuehrers</span>, a pool of political leaders; and whole the party
was—in the words of a German law—“the bearer of the concept
of the German State,” it was not identical with the State. Hence,
in order to realize its ideological and political objectives and to
reach the German people, the party had to avail itself of official
state channels. The <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>, and the agencies and offices
established by it, were the chosen instruments by means of
which party policies were converted into legislative and administrative
acts binding upon the German people as a whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to accomplish this result, the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> was
thoroughly remodelled so as to coordinate party and state machinery,
in order to impose the will of the <span class='it'>Fuehrer</span> on the German
people. On 30 January 1933 the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> contained
but few National Socialists. But as the power of the party in
the Reich grew, the composition of the cabinet came to include
an ever-increasing number of Nazis until, by January 1937, no
non-party member remained in the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>. New cabinet
posts were created and Nazis appointed to fill them. Many
of these cabinet members were also in the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> of the
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To give a few examples: Rosenberg, the Delegate of the <span class='it'>Fuehrer</span>
for Ideological Training and Education of the Party, was a
member of the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> as Minister for the Occupied
Eastern Territories (<span class='it'>Reichsminister f. d. b. Ostgebiete</span>). Frick,
the leader of the National Socialist faction in the Reichstag, was
also Minister of the Interior (<span class='it'>Reichsinnenminister</span>). Goebbels,
the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> for Propaganda, also sat in the cabinet as Minister
for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda (<span class='it'>Reichsminister
fuer Volksaufklaerung und Propaganda</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>After 25 July 1934, party participation in the work of the
cabinet was at all times attained through Rudolf Hess, the Deputy
of the <span class='it'>Feuhrer</span>. By a decree of the <span class='it'>Fuehrer</span>, Hess was invested
with power to take part in the editing of bills dealing with all
departments of the Reich. Later this power of the Fuehrer’s
Deputy was expanded to include all executive decisions and orders
published in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>. After Hess’ flight to
England in 1941, Martin Bormann took over, as his successor,
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
the same function and, in addition, was given the authority of a
Reich minister and made a member of the cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 January 1937 Hitler accepted into the party those last
few members of the cabinet who were not then party members.
Only one cabinet member had the strength of character to reject
membership in the party; he was the Minister of Ports and of
Transportation, von Eltz-Ruebenach, who stated at the time that
he was unable to reconcile membership in the NSDAP with his
beliefs in Christianity. But such was not the case with Constantin
von Neurath. He did not reject party membership. Nor
did Erich Raeder reject party membership. And if Hjalmar
Schacht was not already a party member at that time, then he
too did not reject membership on 30 January 1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chart shows many other instances where party members
on the highest as well as on subordinate levels occupied corresponding
or other positions in the organization of the state.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>a.</span> Hitler himself, the <span class='it'>Fuehrer</span> of the NSDAP, was also the
Chancellor of the Reich, with which office the office of President
of the German Republic was united after the death of President
von Hindenburg in 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>b.</span> Goering, the successor designate of Hitler as Fuehrer of the
NSDAP, was a member of the cabinet as Minister for Air (<span class='it'>Luftfahrtminister</span>),
and he also held many other important positions,
including that of Commander in Chief of the <span class='it'>Luftwaffe</span>, the German
air force, and Delegate for the Four Year Plan (<span class='it'>Beauftragter
f. d. Vierjahresplan</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>c.</span> Heinrich Himmler, the notorious head of the SS (<span class='it'>Reichsfuehrer
SS</span>), was also Chief of the German Police, reporting to
Frick. He himself later became Minister of the Interior after the
attempted assassination of Hitler on 20 June 1944, which event
also catapulted him into the position of Commander in Chief of
the German Reserve Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Reichstag</span>, which was the German parliament, presents an
anomaly in this picture. Under the Republic it had been the supreme
law-making body of the Reich, subject only to a limited
check by the <span class='it'>Reichsrat</span> (Council of the Reich), the President, and
the German people themselves, by way of initiative and referendum.
Putting their opposition to all forms of parliamentarism
at once into effect, the Nazis proceeded to curtail these legislative
powers of the <span class='it'>Reichstag</span>, the <span class='it'>Reichsrat</span>, and the <span class='it'>Reichspraesident</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the Act of 24 March 1933 the cabinet was given unlimited
legislative powers, including the right to deviate from the constitution.
Subsequently the <span class='it'>Reichsrat</span> was abolished; and later,
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
upon the death of President von Hindenburg in 1934, the posts
of Chancellor and President were merged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The development of the <span class='it'>Reichstag</span> into an emasculated legislative
body was an intermediate step on the road to rule by Fuehrer
decree, the ultimate goal of the National Socialist party—and one
which it achieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis then proceeded to delegate some of the functions of
the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> to various newly-created agencies. Cabinet
functions were delegated:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. To the <span class='it'>Reichsverteidigungsrat</span>, the Reich Defense Council,
possibly as early as 4 April 1933 but certainly not later than May
1935. This was a large war-planning group of which Hitler was
chairman and Goering alternate. The group included many
cabinet members, and a working committee, presided over by
Fieldmarshal Wilhelm Keitel, was also composed of cabinet members
and Reich defense officials, the majority of whom were appointed
by cabinet members and subordinate to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. To the Plenipotentiary for War Economy (<span class='it'>Generalbevollmaechtigter
f. d. Kriegswirtschaft</span>), Hjalmar Schacht (and
later Walter Funk), who by the Secret Reich Defense Law of
May 1935 was authorized to “begin his work already in peacetime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. To the Plenipotentiary for Administration (<span class='it'>Generalbevollmaechtigter
f. d. Reichsverwaltung</span>), Wilhelm Frick, whose
deputy, Himmler, later succeeded him, and who was appointed
by a Secret Reich Defense Law. Subordinate to Frick as Plenipotentiary
were the ministries of the Interior, Justice, Education,
Church Affairs and <span class='it'>Raumordnung</span> (Spatial Planning).</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. To the Delegate for the Four Year Plan (<span class='it'>Beauftragter f. d.
Vierjahresplan</span>), Goering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. To the <span class='it'>Dreierkollegium</span>, the College of Three, consisting of
the two Plenipotentiaries for War Economy and Administration,
and Fieldmarshal Keitel as chief of the OKW. The duties of this
<span class='it'>Dreierkollegium</span> appear to have included the drafting of decrees
in preparation of and for use during the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>6. To the <span class='it'>Geheime Kabinettsrat</span>, the Secret Cabinet Council,
created by Fuehrer decree in February 1938, of which von
Neurath was president; and</p>

<p class='pindent'>7. To the <span class='it'>Ministerrat f. d. Reichsverteidigung</span>, the Council of
Ministers for the Defense of the Reich, established by <span class='it'>Fuehrer</span>
decree on 30 August 1939 and responsible to him alone. Its membership
was taken from the Reich Defense Council. It had broad
powers to issue decrees with force of law insofar as the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>
itself had not legislated on the subject.
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It should be stressed that this delegation of cabinet functions
and authority to various secret and semi-secret groups composed
largely of its own members, helped to conceal some of the
most important policies of the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>, particularly those
relating to preparation for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, step by step, the National Socialist party succeeded in
putting its policies into effect through the machinery of the state,
the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>, in its revised form.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg184b'>I. COMMON OBJECTIVES, METHODS, AND DOCTRINES OF<br/> THE CONSPIRACY</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In 1921 Adolf Hitler became the supreme leader or <span class='it'>Fuehrer</span> of
the <span class='it'>Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</span> (National Socialist
German Workers Party), also known as the Nazi Party,
which had been founded in Germany in 1920. He continued as
such throughout the period covered by the Indictment. As will
be shown, the Nazi Party, together with certain of its subsidiary
organizations, became the instrument of cohesion among, the defendants
and their co-conspirators and an instrument for the carrying
out of the aims and purposes of the conspiracy. And as
will also be shown, each defendant became a member of the Nazi
Party and of the conspiracy, with knowledge of their aims, and
purposes, or, with such knowledge, became an accessory to their
aims and purposes at some stage of the development of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Aims, and Purposes.</span> The aims and purposes of the Nazi
conspirators were:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>To abrogate and overthrow the Treaty of Versailles and
its restrictions upon the military armament and activity of Germany.</span>
The first major public meeting of the NSDAP took place
in Munich on 24 February 1920. At that meeting Hitler publicly
announced the Program of the Party. That program, consisting
of 25 points (annually reprinted in the National Socialist Yearbook),
was referred to as “The political foundation of the NSDAP
and therewith the fundamental political law of the state,” and
“has remained unaltered” since the date of its promulgation. Section
2 of the Program provided as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We demand equality of rights for the German people with
respect to other nations, and abolition of the Peace Treaties
of Versailles and St. Germain.” (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech at Munich on 13 April 1923, Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It was no Peace Treaty which they have signed, but a betrayal
of Peace. So long as this Treaty stands there can be
no resurrection of the German people: no social reform of any
kind is possible. The Treaty was made in order to bring 20
million Germans to their deaths and to ruin the German nation.
But those who made the Treaty cannot set it aside. At
its foundation our movement formulated three demands:
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span></p>
<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'>1. Setting aside of the Peace Treaty</p>

<p class='hang'>2. Unification of all Germans</p>

<p class='hang'>3. Land and soil (<span class='it'>Grund und Boden</span>) to feed our nation.”
(<span class='it'>2405-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On August 1, 1923 Hitler declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The day must come when a German government shall summon
up the courage to declare to the foreign powers: ‘The
Treaty of Versailles is founded on a monstrous lie.’ We fulfill
nothing more. Do what you will! If you want battle,
look for it! Then we shall see whether you can turn 70 million
Germans into serfs and slaves!” (<span class='it'>2405-PS</span>; see also
additional statements of Hitler contained in <span class='it'>2405-PS</span> castigating
those Germans who shared responsibility for the
Treaty of Versailles, viz; the “November criminals.”)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his speech of 30 January 1941 Hitler alluded to the consistency
of his record concerning the aims of National Socialist foreign
policy:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“My foreign policy had identical aims. My program was to
abolish the Treaty of Versailles. It is futile nonsense for the
rest of the world to pretend today that I did not reveal this
program until 1933 or 1935 or 1937. Instead of listening to
the foolish chatter of emigrés, these gentlemen would have
been wiser to read what I have written thousands of times.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“No human being has declared or recorded what he wanted
more than I. Again and again I wrote these words: ‘The
abolition of the Treaty of Versailles’. * * *” (<span class='it'>2541-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Similar views were expressed by other Nazi conspirators.
Rosenberg stated that the lie of Germany’s war guilt was the basis
of the Treaties of Versailles and St. Germain. He rejected
the idea of a “revision” of those Treaties and demanded outright
cancellation. (<span class='it'>2433-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess, in advocating rearmament in violation of treaty restrictions,
stated in 1986 that “guns instead of butter” were necessary
lest “one day our last butter be taken from us.” (<span class='it'>2426-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>To acquire the territories lost by Germany as the result of
the World War of 1914-1918, and other territories in Europe asserted
to be occupied by so-called “racial Germans.”</span> Section I of
the Nazi Party Platform gave advance notice of the intentions of
the Nazi conspirators to claim territories occupied by so-called
racial Germans. It provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We demand the unification of all Germans in the Greater
Germany on the basis of the right of self-determination of
people.” (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>While Rosenberg pointed out in 1922 that it was not possible
at that time to designate “such European and non European territories
which would be taken into consideration for colonization”
he nevertheless stated that the following could be laid down as a
basic objective, namely that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * German Foreign Policy must make its most important
primary goal the consolidation of all Germans living
closely together in Europe in one state and to secure the territory
of what today is the Polish-Czech East.” (<span class='it'>2433-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his Reichstag speech of 20 February 1928 Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The claim, therefore, for German colonial possession will be
voiced from year to year with increasing vigor, possessions
which Germany did not take away from other countries, and
which today are virtually of no value to these powers, but
appear indispensable for our own people.” (<span class='it'>2772-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again, in his Reichstag speech of 30 January 1939 Hitler declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The theft of the German colonies was morally unjustified.
Economically, it was utter insanity. The political motives
advanced were so mean that one is tempted to call them silly.
In 1918, after the end of the war, the victorious Powers really
would have had the authority to bring about a reasonable
settlement of international problems. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The great German colonial possessions, which the Reich
once acquired peacefully by treaties and by paying for them,
have been stolen—contrary indeed to the solemn assurance
given by President Wilson, which was the basic condition on
which Germany laid down her arms. The objection that
these colonial possessions are of no importance in any case
should only lead to their being returned to us with an easy
mind.” (<span class='it'>2773-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>To acquire further territories in colonial Europe and elsewhere
claimed to be required by “racial Germans” as “Lebensraum”
or living space, at the expense of neighboring and other
countries.</span> Hitler made it clear that the two objectives of the
Nazi conspirators set forth above were only preliminary steps in
a more ambitious plan of territorial aggrandizement. Thus he
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“One must take the point of view, coolly and soberly, that it
certainly cannot be the intention of Heaven to give one people
fifty times as much space (<span class='it'>Grund und Boden</span>) on this earth
as to another. One should not permit himself to be diverted
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
in this case by political boundaries from the boundaries of
eternal justice.</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The boundaries of 1914 do not mean anything for the future
of the German nation. They did not represent either a
defense of the past nor would they represent a power in the
future. The German people will not obtain either its inner
compactness by them, nor will its nutrition be secured by
them, nor do these boundaries appear from a military standpoint
as appropriate or even satisfactory. * * *” (<span class='it'>2760-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>While the precise limits of German expansion were only vaguely
defined by the Nazi conspirators, they clearly indicated that the
<span class='it'>lebensraum</span> to which they felt they were entitled would be acquired
primarily in the East. Rosenberg was particularly insistent
in his declarations that Russia would have to “move over” to
make way for German living space. He underlined this demand as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The understanding that the German nation, if it is not to
perish in the truest sense of the word, needs ground and soil
for itself and its future generations, and the second sober
perception that this soil can no more be conquered in Africa,
but in Europe and first of all in the East—these organically
determine the German foreign policy for centuries. (<span class='it'>2777-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Russians * * * will have to confine themselves so
as to remove their center of gravity to Asia.” (<span class='it'>2426-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A similar view was expressed by Hitler in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If one wanted territory in Europe, this could be done on
the whole at the expense of Russia, and the new Reich would
have to set out to march over the road of the former Knights,
in order to give soil to the German plow by means of the
German sword, and to give daily bread to the nation.”
(<span class='it'>2760-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> Hitler threatened war as a means of attaining
additional space:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If this earth really has space (<span class='it'>Raum</span>) for all to live in, then
we should be given the territory necessary. Of course, one
will not do that gladly. Then, however, the right of self-preservation
comes into force; that which is denied to kindness,
the fist will have to take. If our forefathers had made
their decisions dependent on the same pacifistic nonsense
as the present, then we would possess only a third of our
present territory.</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“In contrast, we, National Socialists, have to hold on steadily
to our foreign political goals, namely, <span class='it'>to secure on this earth
the territory due to the German people</span>. And this action is
the only one which will make bloody sacrifice before God and
our German posterity appear justified.” (<span class='it'>2760-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Methods. The Nazi conspirators advocated the accomplishment
of the foregoing aims and purposes by any means deemed
opportune, including illegal means and resort to threat of force,
force, and aggressive war.</span> The use of force was distinctly sanctioned,
in fact guaranteed, by official statements and directives
of the conspirators which made activism and aggressiveness a
political quality obligatory for Party members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler stated in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The lack of a great creative idea means at all
times an impairment of the fighting spirit. The conviction
that it is right to use even the most brutal weapons is always
connected with the existence of a fanatical belief that it is
necessary that a revolutionary new order of this earth should
become victorious. A movement which does not fight for
these highest aims and ideals will therefore never resort to
the ultimate weapon.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * It is not possible to undertake a task half-heartedly
or hesitatingly if its execution seems to be feasible only
by expending the very last ounce of energy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One had to
become clear in one’s mind that this goal [i.e. acquisition of
new territory in Europe] could be achieved by fight alone
and then had to face this armed conflict with calmness and
composure.” (<span class='it'>2760-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In 1934 Hitler set out the duties of Party members in the following
terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Only a part of the people will be really active fighters. But
they were the fighters of the National Socialist struggle.
They were the fighters for the National Socialist revolution,
and they are the millions of the rest of the population. For
them it is not sufficient to confess: ‘I believe,’ but to swear:
‘<span class='it'>I fight</span>’.” (<span class='it'>2775-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This same theme is expressed in the Party Organization Book:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Party includes <span class='it'>only fighters</span> who are ready to accept
and sacrifice everything in order to carry through the National
Socialist ideology.” (<span class='it'>2774-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the trial of <span class='it'>Reichswehr</span> officers at Leipzig in September
1930 Hitler testified:
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany is being strangled by Peace Treaties. * * *
The National Socialists do not regard the Treaty as a law, but
as something forced upon us. We do not want future generations,
who are completely innocent, to be burdened by
this. When we fight this with all means at our disposal,
then we are on the way to a revolution.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>President of the Court: ‘Even by illegal means?’</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>Hitler: “I will declare here and now, that when we have
become powerful (<span class='it'>gesiegt haben</span>), then we shall fight against
the Treaty with all the means at our disposal, even from the
point of view of the world, with illegal means.” (<span class='it'>2512-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, Hitler stated the true reason for rearmament as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is impossible to build up an army and give it a sense of
worth if the object of its existence is not the preparation for
war. Armies for the preservation of peace do not exist;
they exist only for the triumphant exertion of war.” (<span class='it'>2541-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Doctrines. The Nazi conspirators adopted and published
the following doctrines:</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>That persons of so-called “German blood” were a master
race and were accordingly entitled to subjugate, dominate, or exterminate
other “races” and “peoples.”</span> The Nazi doctrine of
racial supremacy was incorporated as Point 4 in the Party Program
of 24 February 1920, which provided as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Only a member of the race can be a citizen. A member of
the race can only be one who is of German blood, without
consideration of creed. Consequently no Jew can be a member
of the race.” (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators’ dogma of the racial supremacy of the
Germanic peoples was fully elucidated in the writings of Rosenberg:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The meaning of world history has radiated out from the
north over the whole world, borne by a blue-eyed blond race
which in several great waves determined the spiritual face
of the world * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We stand today before a definitive decision. Either through
a new experience and cultivation of the old blood, coupled
with an enhanced fighting will, we will rise to a purificatory
action, or the last Germanic-western values of morality and
state-culture shall sink away in the filthy human masses of
the big cities, become stunted on the sterile burning asphalt
of a bestialized inhumanity, or trickle away as a morbific
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
agent in the form of emigrants bastardizing themselves in
South America, China, Dutch East India, Africa.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A new faith is arising today: the myth of the blood, the
faith, to defend with the blood the divine essence of man.
The faith, embodied in clearest knowledge that the Nordic
blood represents that mysterium which has replaced and
overcome the old sacraments.” (<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the Nazi conspirators acclaimed the “master race” doctrine
as a new religion—the faith of the blood—superseding in
individual allegiance all other religions and institutions. According
to Rosenberg:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The new thought puts folk and race higher than the state
and its forms. It declares protection of the folk more important
than protection of a religious denomination, a class,
the monarchy, or the republic; it sees in treason against the
folk a greater crime than treason against the state.” (<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>;
see also further excerpts from Rosenberg’s writings
contained in <span class='it'>2405-PS</span>.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Illustrative of the Nazi conspirators’ continued espousal and
exploitation of racial dogmas following their accession to power
was the discriminatory legislation which they caused to be enacted.
These laws, with particular reference to Jews, are set
forth in Section 7 of this Chapter on the Program for Persecution
of Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The logical consequence of the “master race” dogma, in its
bearing on the right of Germany to dominate other “inferior”
peoples and to acquire such of their territory as was considered
necessary for German living space, was disclosed by the Nazi
conspirators. In a speech concluding the <span class='it'>Reichsparteitag</span> at
Nurnberg on 3 September 1933 Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“But long ago man has proceeded in the same way with his
fellowman. The higher race—at first ‘higher’ in the sense
of possessing a greater gift for organization—subjects to
itself a lower race and thus constitutes a relationship which
now embraces races of unequal value. Thus there results
the subjection of a number of people under the will often
of only a few persons, a subjection based simply on the
right of the stronger, a right which, as we see it in Nature,
can be regarded as the sole conceivable right because
founded on reason. The wild mustang does not take upon
itself the yoke imposed by man either voluntarily or joyfully;
neither does one people welcome the violence of another.”

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Essential elements.</span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>1. Complete and total authority is vested in the Fuehrer.</span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer Principle requires a pyramidal organization
structure in its details as well as in its entirety.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer is at the top.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“He nominates the necessary leaders for the various
spheres of work of the Reich’s direction, the Party
apparatus and the State administration.” (<span class='it'>1814-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“He shapes the collective will of the people within himself
and he enjoys the political unity and entirety of
the people in opposition to individual interests.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer unites in himself all the sovereign authority
of the Reich; all public authority in the state
as well as in the movement is derived from the authority
of the Fuehrer. We must speak not of the state’s
authority but of the Fuehrer’s authority if we wish
to designate the character of the political authority
within the Reich correctly. The state does not hold
political authority as an impersonal unit but receives
it from the Fuehrer as the executor of the national
will. The authority of the Fuehrer is complete and all-embracing;
it unites in itself all the means of political
direction; it extends into all fields of national life; it
embraces the entire people, which is bound to the Fuehrer
in loyalty and obedience. The authority of the
Fuehrer is not limited by checks and controls, by
special autonomous bodies or individual rights, but it
is free and independent, all-inclusive and unlimited.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer-Reich of the (German) people is
founded on the recognition that the true will of the
people cannot be disclosed through parliamentary
votes and plebiscites but that the will of the people in
its pure and uncorrupted form can only be expressed
through the Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Thus at the head of the Reich, stands a single Fuehrer,
who in his personality embodies the idea which
sustains all and whose spirit and will therefore animate
the entire community.” (<span class='it'>2780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As stated in the Organization Book of the Nazi Party:
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The will of the Fuehrer is the Party’s law.”
(<span class='it'>1814-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The first commandment for the Party members declares:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer is always right.” (<span class='it'>1814-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“He (the Fuehrer) is responsible only to his conscience
and the German people.” (<span class='it'>1814-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hess, in a speech broadcast at Cologne on 25 June 1934,
characterized the position of the Fuehrer as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is with pride that we see that one man is kept above
all criticism—that is the Fuehrer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The reason is that everyone feels and knows: he was
always right and will always be right. The National
Socialism of us all is anchored in the uncritical loyalty,
in the devotion to the Fuehrer that does not ask for
the wherefore in the individual case, in the tacit performance
of his commands. We believe that the Fuehrer
is fulfilling a divine mission to German destiny!
This belief is beyond challenge.” (<span class='it'>2426-PS</span>; see also
additional statements of the Nazi conspirators designed
to condition the German people to blind acceptance
of the decisions of the Fuehrer and his co-conspirators,
as translated in <span class='it'>2373-PS</span>.)</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>2. The Fuehrer’s power descends to sub-leaders in a hierarchial
order.</span> In the words of the Organization Book
of the NSDAP:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Party is the order of fuehrers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All political directors (<span class='it'>Politische Leiter</span>) stand as
appointed by the Fuehrer and are responsible to him.
They possess full authority towards the lower echelons.
(<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“He (The Fuehrer) nominates the necessary leaders
for the various spheres of work of the Reichs’ direction,
the Party apparatus, and the State administration.”
(<span class='it'>1814-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The effect of this was aptly expressed by Hitler in 1933:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When our opponents said, ‘It is easy for you: you
are a dictator’—We answer them, ‘No, gentlemen, you
are wrong; there is no single dictator, but ten thousand,
each in his own place.’ And even the highest
authority in the hierarchy has itself only one wish,
never to transgress against the supreme authority to
which it, too, is responsible.” (<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span></p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>3. Each subleader is bound to unconditional obedience to
his immediate superior and to the Fuehrer.</span> As Hitler
said,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We have in our movement developed this loyalty in
following the leader, this blind obedience of which
all the others know nothing and which gave to us the
power to surmount everything.” (<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The duty of obedience is so fundamental that it is incorporated
as the second of the NSDAP commandments
for party members:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Never go against discipline!” (<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As Ley said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Our conscience is clearly and exactly defined. Only
what Adolf Hitler, our Fuehrer, commands, allows,
or does not allow is our conscience.” (<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The obedience required was not the loyalty of a soldier
to the Fatherland, as was the case prior to the Nazi
regime. On the contrary, the obedience exacted was unconditional
and absolute, regardless of the legality or illegality
of the order. The oath taken by political leaders
(<span class='it'>Politische Leiter</span>) yearly was as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I pledge eternal allegiance to Adolf Hitler. I pledge
unconditional obedience to him and the Fuehrers appointed
by him.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>4. Each subleader is absolute in his own sphere of jurisdiction.</span>
The Nazi Party Organization Book lays down
the same principle with respect to the successive tiers of
its leaders:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer Principle represented by the Party imposes
complete responsibility on all party leaders for
their respective spheres of activity * * * The
responsibility for all tasks within a major sphere of
jurisdiction rests with the respective leader of the
NSDAP: i.e., with the Fuehrer for the territory of
the Reich, the Gauleiter for the territory of the Gau,
the district leader for the territory of the district, the
local leader for the territory of the local group, etc.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Party leader has responsibility for the entire
territory under his jurisdiction on the one hand, and
on the other hand, his own political fields of activity
appertaining thereto.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This responsibility for the complete or partial performance
of task entails a relationship of subordination
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
of the leaders among themselves, corresponding
to the fuehrer principle.” (<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Glorification of War as a noble and necessary activity of
Germans.</span> The Nazi conspirators disseminated dogmas designed
to engender in the masses a deep reverence for the vocation of
the warrior and to induce acceptance of the postulate that the
waging of war was good and desirable <span class='it'>per se</span>. The motive underlying
the concerted program of the Nazis to glorify war was
disclosed by Hitler in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Thus the question of how to regain German power is not:
How shall we manufacture arms?, but: How do we create
the spirit which enables a nation to bear arms? If this
spirit governs a people, the will finds thousands of ways,
each of which ends with a weapon!”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Oppressed countries are led back into the lap of
a common Reich by a mighty sword and not by flaming protests.
It is the task of the inner political leaders of a people
to forge this sword; to safeguard the work of the smith and
to seek comrades in arms in the task of the foreign policy.”
(<span class='it'>2760-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s writings and public utterances are full of declarations
rationalizing the use of force and glorifying war. The following
are typical:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Always before God and the world, the stronger has the
right to carry through his will. History proves it: He who
has no might, has no use for might. (<span class='it'>2405-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The political testament of the German People for its foreign
policy should and must always follow this line of thought:
Never tolerate the rise of two continental powers in Europe.
See in every attempt to organize a second military power,
* * * an attack against Germany and take therefrom
not only the right but the duty to prevent by all means, including
the use of arms, the rise of such a state, respectively
to destroy such a state if it has already arisen. Take care
that the strength of our people should have its foundation
not in colonies but in the soil of the home country in Europe.
Never consider the Reich as secured as long as it cannot give
to every descendant of our people his own bit of soil for
centuries to come; never forget that the most sacred right
on this earth is the right to own the soil which one wants to
cultivate and the most sacred sacrifice, the blood which is
shed for this soil.” (<span class='it'>2760-A-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>The leadership of the Nazi Party.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>The Nazi Party leadership was the sole bearer of the doctrines
of the Nazi Party.</span> The Party Organization Book declares:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Party as an instrument of ideological education, must
grow to be the Leader Corps (<span class='it'>Fuehrer Korps</span>) of the German
Nation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This Leader Corps is responsible for the complete penetration
of the German Nation with the National Socialist
spirit * * *” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Party is the order of fuehrers. It is furthermore responsible
for the spiritual ideological National Socialist
direction of the German people.” (<span class='it'>1814-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Referring to the mission of the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span> (local chapter
leader) of the NSDAP, the Party Organization Book states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As Hoeheitstraeger (bearer of sovereignty) all expressions
of the party will emanate from him; he is responsible for
the political and ideological leadership and organization
within his zone of sovereignty.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Similar statements are made with regard to the <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>
(county leader) and the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> (Gau leader) and the Reich Directorate
(1893-PS).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>The Nazi Party leadership was entitled to control and dominate
the German state and all related institutions and all individuals
therein.</span> Hitler said at the 1935 Nurnberg Party Congress:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is not the State which gives orders to us, it is we who
give orders to the State.” (<span class='it'>2775-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Frick declared in a similar vein:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In National Socialist Germany, leadership is in the hands
of an organized community, the National Socialist Party; and
as the latter represents the will of the nation, the policy
adopted by it in harmony with the vital interests of the nation
is at the same time the policy adopted by the country.
* * *” (<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goebbels declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Party must always continue to represent the hierarchy
of National Socialist leadership. This minority must always
insist upon its prerogative to control the state. * * * It
is responsible for the leadership of the state and it solemnly
relieves the people of this responsibility.” (<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hess remarked that the Party was a “necessity” in the German
state and constituted the cohesive mechanism with which to “organize
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
and direct offensively and defensively the spiritual and political
strength of the people.” (<span class='it'>2426-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nazi interpreters of constitutional law expressed the same idea:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The NSDAP is not a structure which stands under direct
state control, to which single tasks of public administration
are entrusted by the state, but it holds and maintains its
claim to totality as the ‘bearer of the German state-idea’ in
all fields relating to the community—regardless of how various
single functions are divided between the organization of
the Party and the organization of the State.” (<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This doctrine was incorporated into laws which established the
NSDAP as “the only political party in Germany” and declared
the NSDAP “The bearer of the German state-idea” and “indissolubly
linked to the state.” (<span class='it'>1388-A-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1395-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>The Nazi Party leadership was entitled to destroy
all opponents.</span> Reference is made generally to Sections2 and 3 on
the Acquisition and Consolidation of Political Control of Germany for
proof of this allegation.

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg199a'>2. ACQUISITION OF TOTALITARIAN POLITICAL CONTROL</h2>

<p class='noindent'>A. <span class='it'>First Steps in Acquiring Control of State Machinery.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators first sought control of State machinery
by force. The Munich Putsch of 1923, aimed at the overthrow
of the Weimar Republic by direct action, failed.</span> On 8 November
1923 the so-called Munich Putsch occurred. During the evening,
von Kahr, State Commissioner General of Bavaria, was speaking
at the <span class='it'>Buergerbraeukeller</span> in Munich. Hitler and other Nazi leaders
appeared, supported by the <span class='it'>Sturmabteilungen</span> (Storm Troops)
and other fighting groups. Hitler fired a shot and announced that
a Nationalist Revolution setting up a dictatorship had taken
place. There followed a conference after which von Kahr, von
Lossow, and Colonel of Police von Seisser, announced they would
cooperate with Hitler and that a “Provisional National Government”
was established, as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It was also announced that Kahr would be State Administrator
for Bavaria, Poehner would be Bavarian Prime Minister, and
Frick would be Munich Police President. Kahr, Lossow and Seisser
then departed. During the night the latter group alerted the
police, brought troops to Munich, and announced that their consent
to the Putsch had been obtained by force. On the afternoon
of the next day, Hitler, Ludendorff, and their supporters attempted
to march into the center of Munich. At the <span class='it'>Feldherrnhalle</span>
the procession met a patrol of police, shots were exchanged,
and men on both sides were killed. Hermann Goering was
wounded, the Putsch was broken up, the Party and its organization
were declared illegal, and its leaders, including Hitler, Frick,
and Streicher were arrested. Rosenberg, together with Amann
and Drexler, tried to keep the Party together after it had been
forbidden. Hitler and others later were tried for high treason.
At the trial Hitler admitted his participation in the foregoing attempt
to seize control of the State by force. He was convicted
and sentenced to imprisonment. (<span class='it'>2532-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2404-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Nazi Conspirators then set out through the Nazi Party
to undermine and capture the German Government by “legal”
forms supported by terrorism.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>In 1925, the conspirators reorganized the Nazi Party and
began a campaign to secure support from Germany voters
throughout the nation.</span> On 26 February 1925, the <span class='it'>Voelkischer
Beobachter</span>, the official newspaper of the National Socialist
German Workers’ Party (NSDAP) appeared for the first time
after the Munich Putsch, and on the following day Hitler made
his first speech after his release from prison. He then began to
rebuild the Party organization. The conspirators, through the
Nazi Party, participated in election campaigns and other political
activity throughout Germany and secured the election of members
of the Reichstag. (<span class='it'>2532-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a reflection of this activity the Nazi Party in May 1928, received
2.6% of the total vote and obtained 12 out of 491 seats in
the Reichstag. In September 1930, the Nazi Party polled 18.3%
of the total vote and won 107 out of 577 seats in the Reichstag.
In July 1932, it received 37.3% of the total vote east and won
230 out of 608 seats. In November 1932, it polled 33.1% of the
vote and won 196 out of 584 seats in the Reichstag. (<span class='it'>2514-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators asserted they sought power only by
legal forms.</span> In November 1934, Hitler, speaking of the Munich
Putsch of 1923 said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It gave me the opportunity to lay down the new tactics of
the Party and to pledge it to legality”. (<span class='it'>2741-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In September 1931, three officers of the <span class='it'>Reichswehr</span> were tried
at Leipzig for high treason. At the request of Hans Frank, Hitler
was invited to testify at this trial that the NSDAP was striving
to attain its goal by purely legal means. He was asked: “How
do you imagine the setting up of a Third Reich?” His reply was,
“This term only describes the basis of the struggle but not the
objective. We will enter the legal organizations and will make
our Party a decisive factor in this way. But when we do possess
constitutional rights then we will form the State in the manner
which we consider to be the right one.” The President then asked:
“This too by constitutional means?” Hitler replied: “Yes.”
(<span class='it'>2512-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>The purpose of the Nazi conspirators in participating in
elections and in the Reichstag was to undermine the parliamentary
system of the Republic and to replace it with a dictatorship
of their own.</span> This the Nazi conspirators themselves made
clear. Frick wrote in 1927:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“There is no National Socialist and no racialist who expects
any kind of manly German deed from that gossip club on the
Koenigsplatz and who is not convinced of the necessity for
direct action by the unbroken will of the German people to
bring about their spiritual and physical liberation. But there
is a long road ahead. After the failure of November, 1923,
there was no choice but to begin all over again and to strive
to bring about a change in the spirit and determination of the
most valuable of our racial comrades, as the indispensable
prerequisite for the success of the coming fight for freedom.
Our activities in parliament must be evaluated as merely
part of this propaganda work.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Our participation in the parliament does not indicate a support,
but rather an undermining of the parliamentarian system.
It does not indicate that we renounce our anti-parliamentarian
attitude, but that we are fighting the enemy with
his own weapons and that we are fighting for our National
Socialist goal from the parliamentary platform.” (<span class='it'>2742-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 April 1928, Goebbels wrote in his paper “<span class='it'>Der Angriff</span>”;</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We enter parliament in order to supply ourselves, in the arsenal
of democracy, with its own weapons. We become members
of the Reichstag in order to paralyze the Weimar sentiment
with its own assistance. If democracy is so stupid as
to give us free tickets and <span class='it'>per diem</span> for the this “blockade”
(<span class='it'>Barendienst</span>), that is its own affair.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Later in the same article he continued:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We do not come as friends, nor even as neutrals. We come
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
as enemies: As the wolf bursts into the flock, so we come.”
(<span class='it'>2500-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a pamphlet published in 1935, Goebbels said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When democracy granted democratic methods for us in the
times of opposition, this was bound to happen in a democratic
system. However, we National Socialists never asserted that
we represented a democratic point of view, but we have declared
openly that we used democratic methods only in order
to gain the power and that, after assuming the power, we
would deny to our adversaries without any consideration the
means which were granted to us in the times of opposition.
(<span class='it'>2412-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A leading Nazi writer on Constitutional Law, Ernst Rudolf Huber,
later wrote of this period:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The parliamentary battle of the NSDAP had the single purpose
of destroying the parliamentary system from within
through its own methods. It was necessary above all to make
formal use of the possibilities of the party-state system but
to refuse real cooperation and thereby to render the parliamentary
system, which is by nature dependent upon the responsible
cooperation of the opposition, incapable of action.”
(<span class='it'>2633-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi members of the Reichstag conducted themselves as
a storm troop unit. Whenever representatives of the government
or the democratic parties spoke, the Nazi members marched out
in a body in studied contempt of the speaker, or entered in a body
to interrupt the speaker, thus making it physically impossible for
the Reichstag President to maintain order. In the case of speakers
of opposition parties, the Nazi members constantly interrupted,
often resorting to lengthy and spurious parliamentary
maneuvers, with the result that the schedule of the session was
thrown out of order. The tactics finally culminated in physical
attacks by the Nazis upon members of the house as well as upon
visitors. (<span class='it'>L-83</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter of 24 August 1931 to Rosenberg, Hitler deplored an
article in “<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>” the effect of which was to
prevent undermining of support for the then existing form of
government, and said: “I myself am travelling all over Germany
to achieve exactly the opposite. (<span class='it'>047-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators supported their “legal” activities by
terrorism.</span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>1. The Nazi conspirators created and utilized as a Party
formation the Sturmabteilungen (SA) a semi-military
voluntary organization of young men trained for and committed
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
to the use of violence, whose mission was to make
the Party the master of the streets.</span> The SA was organized
in 1921. As indicated by its name, it was a voluntary
organization of young men trained for and committed to
the use of violence. To quote from a pamphlet compiled
on order of the Supreme SA Headquarters:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The SA was not founded as one forms just any sort
of club. It was born in midst of strife and received
from the Fuehrer himself the name “Storm Troops”
after that memorable hall battle in Hofbraeuhaus at
Munich on the 4th of November 1921. * * * Blood
and sacrifice were the most faithful companions of the
young SA on its hard path to power. The Storm Troops
were and still are today the fist and propaganda arm
of the movement”. (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was organized along semi-military lines from the beginning.
To quote again from the same official pamphlet:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is one of the greatest historical services of the SA
that at the time when the German People’s Army had
to undergo a dissolution, it held high those virtues
which marked the German soldier: personal courage,
idealism, willingness to sacrifice, consciousness of responsibility,
power to decide, and leadership. Thus,
the SA became among the people the messenger and
bearer of German armed strength and German armed
spirit.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The 4th of November 1921 was not only the birth
hour of the SA by itself, but was the day from which
the young fighting troop of the Movement took its
stand at the focal point of political events. With the
clear recognition that now the unity (<span class='it'>Geschlossenheit</span>)
of a troop led to victory, the SA was systematically
reorganized and so-called “Centuries” (<span class='it'>Hundertschaften</span>)
were established * * *” (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In March 1928, Goering took command of the entire SA.
In November 1923, SA units were used in the Munich
Putsch. When the Party was reorganized in 1925, the SA
continued to be the fighting organization of the Party.
Again to quote the official pamphlet on the SA:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“And now a fight for Germany began of such a sort
as was never before fought. What are names, what
are words or figures which are not indeed able to express
the magnitude of belief and of idealism on one
side and the magnitude of hate on the other side.
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
1925: the Party lives again, and its iron spearhead is
the SA. With it the power and meaning of the National
Socialist movement grows. Around the central
events of the whole Movement, the Reich Party Days,
dates, decisions, fights and victory roll themselves into
a long list of German men of undenying willingness to
sacrifice.” (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mastery of the streets was at all times the mission of
the SA. While discussing his ideas as to the part which
this organization should play in the political activity of
his Party, Hitler stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“What we needed and still need were and are not a
hundred or two hundred reckless conspirators, but a
hundred thousand and a second hundred thousand
fighters for our philosophy of life. We should not work
in secret conventicles, but in mighty mass demonstrations,
and it is not by dagger and poison or pistol that
the road can be cleared for the movement but by the
conquest of the streets. We must teach the Marxists
that the future master of the streets is National Socialism,
just as it will some day be the master of the
state.” (<span class='it'>404-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To quote again from the official SA pamphlet:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Possession of the streets is the key to power in the
state—for this reason the SA marched and fought.
The public would have never received knowledge from
the agitative speeches of the little Reichstag faction
and its propaganda or from the desires and aims of
the Party, if the martial tread and battle song of the
SA companies had not beat the measure for the truth
of a relentless criticism of the state of affairs in the
governmental system. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The SA conquered for itself a place in public opinion
and the leadership of the National Socialist Movement
dictated to its opponents the law for quarrels. The SA
was already a state within a state; a part of the future
in a sad present.” (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>; for further material
concerning the SA, see Section 4 of Chapter XV.)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>2. The Nazi conspirators constantly used physical violence
and terror to break up meetings of political opponents, and
to suppress opposition in their own meetings.</span> The following
facts are indicative of the methods constantly used by
the Nazi conspirators during this period: On numerous
occasions meetings of the <span class='it'>Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft</span>
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
(Peace Society) were broken up and terrorized by shock
troops and SA units. Groups of National Socialists invaded
meetings of the society, interrupted the speaker, attempted
to attack him, and endeavored to make sufficient disturbance
so that the meetings would have to be cancelled.
(<span class='it'>L-83</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>To quote once again from the official SA pamphlet:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * As an example of a seemingly impossible
deed, the 11th of February 1927 should be firmly preserved.
It is the day on which the SA broke the Red
Terror, with heavy sacrifice, in the hall battle at the
Pharoah’s Hall (<span class='it'>Pharussaelen</span>) in Berlin, the stronghold
of the Communists, and thereby established itself
decisively in the capitol city of the Reich. In considering
the badly wounded SA men, Dr. Goebbels coined
the phrase “unknown SA Man”, who silently fights
and bleeds, obeying only his duty.” (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Berlin, under the leadership of Goebbels, so-called
<span class='it'>Rollkommandos</span>, were organized for the purpose of disrupting
political meetings of all non-Nazi groups. These <span class='it'>Rollkommandos</span>
were charged with interrupting, making noise,
and unnerving the speaker. Finally the Nazis broke up
meetings by <span class='it'>Rollkommando</span> raids. In many cases, fights
resulted, during which furniture was destroyed and a number
of persons hurt. The Nazis armed themselves with
blackjacks, brass knuckles, rubber truncheons, walking
sticks, and beer bottles. After the Reichstag election of
1930, Nazi terrorism became more overt, and from then on
scarcely a day went by when the Chief of the Security Police
in Berlin did not receive a minimum of five to ten reports,
and often more, of riots instigated by Nazis.
(<span class='it'>2955-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the campaign for the Reichstag election of 14
September 1930, Nazi conspirators made it a practice to
send speakers accompanied by many Storm Troopers to
meetings of other political parties, often physically taking
over the meetings. On one such occasion a large detachment
of Storm Troopers, some of whom were armed with
pistols and clubs, attended a meeting called by the Social
Democratic Party, succeeded in forcibly excluding everybody
not in sympathy with their views, and concluded the
meeting as their own. Such violent tactics, repeated many
times, were an integral part of the political creed of the
Nazi. (<span class='it'>L-83</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Ultimately, in Berlin, just before the Nazis seized power,
it was necessary to devote the entire Police Force to the
job of fighting the Nazis, thus leaving little time for other
Police duties. (<span class='it'>2955-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>3. The Nazi conspirators constantly threatened their opponents
with organized reprisals and terror.</span> During the
course of the trial of three officers of the <span class='it'>Reichswehr</span> for
high treason in Leipzig in September 1931, Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“But I may assure you that if the Nazi movement’s
struggle is successful, then there will be a Nazi Court
of Law too, the November 1918 revolution will be
atoned, and there’ll be some heads chopped off.” (<span class='it'>2512-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Frick wrote in the National Socialist Yearbook for 1930:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“No wonder that as the situation of the entire German
people, as well as that of the individual racial comrade,
grows rapidly worse, increased numbers are realizing
the incompetence of the parliamentarian system, and
no wonder that even some who are responsible for the
present system desperately cry for a dictatorship. This
however, will not save them from their fate of one day
being called to account before a German State Tribunal.”
(<span class='it'>2743-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 7 October 1929, the National Socialist District leader
Terboven said in a meeting in Essen:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“This weakness is especially known to Severing, who
symbolizes the present State, and he intends to render
a service to the State, which is breathing its last; but
this too will no longer save the present corrupt parliamentarian
system. * * * But I give such a dictatorship
only four weeks. Then the people will
awaken, then the National Socialists will come to
power, and then there will not be enough lamp posts
in Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The National Socialists will march into the new
Reichstag with thirty members; then there will be
black eyes every day in this Reichstag; thus this corrupt
parliamentarian system will be further discredited;
disorder and chaos will set in, and then the National
Socialists will judge the moment to have arrived

<p class='noindent'>“This fateful struggle will first be taken up with the
ballot, but this cannot continue indefinitely, for history
has taught us that in a battle, blood must be shed, and
iron broken. The ballot is the beginning of this fateful
struggle. We are determined to promulgate by
force that which we preach. Just as Mussolini exterminated
the Marxists in Italy, so must we also succeed
in accomplishing the same through dictatorship and
terror.” (<span class='it'>2513-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In December 1932, Frick, at that time Chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee of the Reichstag, stated to a
fellow member of that committee:</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>4. The Nazi conspirators openly approved acts of terrorist
committed by their subordinates.</span> On 22 August 1932, five
National Socialists were condemned to death for a murder
in the town of Potempa. Hitler wired to the condemned
men:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“My Comrades! Faced with this terrible blood sentence,
I feel myself bound to you in unlimited faithfulness.
Your liberty is from this moment a question
of our honor. To fight against a Government under
which such a thing could happen is our duty.”
(<span class='it'>2532-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2511-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering, two days later sent the following telegram to
the condemned men:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In nameless embitterment and rage against the terror
sentence which has struck you, I promise you, My
Comrades, that our whole fight from now on will be
for your freedom. You are no murderers. You have
defended the life and the honor of your Comrades. I
send to your families today 1,000 Marks which I have
received from your friends. Be courageous. More than
14,000,000 of the best Germans have made your interest
their own.” (<span class='it'>2634-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 2 September 1932, the death sentences were commuted
to imprisonment for life. In 1933, after the Nazis
came into power, the five were set free. (<span class='it'>2532-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after coming to power the Nazi conspirators took
steps to grant a general amnesty for all unlawful acts, including
acts of violence, committed by their adherents in
the course of their struggle for power. On 21 March 1933
a decree was promulgated, signed by von Hindenburg,
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
Hitler, Frick, and von Papen granting amnesty “For
penal acts committed in the national revolution of the
German People, in its preparation or in the fight for the
German soil”. (<span class='it'>2059-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>On 30 January 1933, Hitler became Chancellor of the German
Republic.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>After the Reichstag fire of 28 February 1933, clauses of
the Weimar Constitution guaranteeing personal liberty and freedom
of speech, of the press, of association and assembly, were
suspended.</span> The Weimar Constitution contained certain guarantees
as to personal freedom (Article 114), as to inviolability of
the home (Article 115), and as to the secrecy of letters and other
communications (Article 117). It also had provisions safeguarding
freedom of speech and of the press (Article 118), and of
assembly (Article 123), and of association (Article 124). The
Reich President was authorized, “if public safety and order in
the German Reich are considerably disturbed or endangered,” to
take steps to suspend “the Fundamental Rights” established in
Articles 114, 115, 117, 118, 123, 124, and 153. (Article 48 (2) ).
(<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 28 February 1933, the Nazi conspirators, taking as their
excuse a fire which had just destroyed the Reichstag building,
caused to be promulgated a Decree of the Reich President suspending
the constitutional guarantees of freedom. This decree,
which purported to be an exercise of the powers of the Reich
President under Article 48 (2) of the Constitution, and which
was signed by the Reich President, Hindenburg, the Reich Chancellor,
Hitler, the Reich Minister of the Interior, Frick, and the
Reich Minister of Justice, Guertner, provided in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Sections 114, 115, 117, 118, 123, 124, and 153 of the Constitution
of the German Reich are suspended until further
notice. Thus, restrictions on personal liberty, on the right
of free expression of opinion, including freedom of the press,
on the right of assembly and the right of association, and
violations of the privacy of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic
communications, and warrants for house-searchers,
orders for confiscations as well as restrictions on property,
are also permissible beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed.”
(<span class='it'>1390-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators secured the passage by the Reichstag
of a “Law for the Protection of the People and the Reich”,
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
giving Hitler and the members of his then Cabinet plenary
powers of legislation.</span> At the first meeting of Hitler’s Cabinet on
30 January 1933, passage of an Enabling Law (<span class='it'>Ermaechtigungsgesetz</span>)
was discussed, and suppression of the Communist Party
was considered as a means for securing the majority requisite
for this and other purposes. (<span class='it'>351-PS</span>) Since such a law involved
a change in the Constitution it was governed by Article 76 of the
Weimar Constitution which provided: “The Constitution may be
amended by law. The acts of the Reichstag amending the Constitution
can only take effect if two-thirds of the regular number
of members are present and at least two-thirds of those present
consent.” (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>) At the first meeting of the Hitler Cabinet
on 30 January 1933, both Hitler and Goering favored early dissolution
of the Reichstag and new elections in an effort to achieve
a majority for the new Cabinet. (<span class='it'>351-PS</span>) This course was followed
and new elections for the Reichstag were held on 5 March
1933, at which 288 Nazi were elected out of 647 members (<span class='it'>2514-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking advantage of the Presidential decree of 28 February
1933 suspending constitutional guarantees of freedom, Goering
and other Nazi conspirators immediately caused a large number
of Communists, including party officials and Reichstag deputies,
and a smaller number of Social Democratic officials and deputies
to be placed in “protective custody”. (<span class='it'>2324-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2573-PS</span>; <span class='it'>L-83</span>)
Thus all Communist deputies and a number of Social Democratic
deputies were prevented from attending the new session of the
Reichstag. On 9 March 1933, Frick announced that the Communists
would be prevented from participating in the first session
of the Reichstag on March 21st, because of their being more usefully
occupied. (<span class='it'>2403-PS</span>) As Frick cynically stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When the Reichstag meets the 21st of March, the Communists
will be prevented by urgent labor elsewhere from
participating in the session. In concentration camps they
will be re-educated for productive work. We will know how
to render harmless permanently sub-humans who do not
want to be re-educated.” (<span class='it'>2651-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At a meeting of the Reich Cabinet on 15 March 1933, the problem
of securing the necessary two-thirds majority in favor of an
Enabling Act was again considered. Frick stated his belief that
the Act would have to be broadly-conceived, in a manner to allow
for any deviation from the clauses of the Constitution of the
Reich. Goering thought the two-thirds majority would be forthcoming
and that if necessary some of the Social Democrats could
be excluded from the room during the voting. (<span class='it'>2962-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At a meeting of the Cabinet on 20 March 1933, there was
further discussion of means for securing the majority and quorum
necessary to secure passage of the Act (<span class='it'>2963-PS</span>). On 23
March, Hitler spoke in favor of an Enabling Law proposed by
the Nazi conspirators and in the course of the debate said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Government insists on the passage of this law. It
expects a clear decision in any case. It offers to all the Parties
in the Reichstag the possibility of a peaceful development
and a possible conciliation in the future. But it is also
determined to consider a disapproval of this law as a declaration
of resistance. It is up to you, gentlemen, to make the
decision now. It will be either peace or war.” (<span class='it'>2652-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus subject to the full weight of Nazi pressure and terror,
the Reichstag passed the proposed law, 441 deputies voting in its
favor, and 94 Social Democrats being opposed (<span class='it'>2579-PS</span>). The
following day, the law was promulgated. It provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichstag has resolved the following law, which is,
with the approval of the Reichsrat, herewith promulgated,
after it has been established that the requirements have
been satisfied for legislation altering the Constitution.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“SECTION 1. Reich laws can be enacted by the Reich Cabinet
as well as in accordance with the Procedure established
in the Constitution. This applies also to the laws referred
to in article 85, paragraph 2, and in article 87 of the Constitution.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“SECTION 2. The national laws enacted by the Reich Cabinet
may deviate from the Constitution so far as they do
not affect the position of the Reichstag and the Reichsrat.
The powers of the President remain undisturbed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“SECTION 3. The national laws enacted by the Reich Cabinet
are prepared by the Chancellor and published in the
Reichsgesetzblatt. They come into effect, unless otherwise
specified, upon the day following their publication. Articles
68 to 77 of the Constitution do not apply to the laws enacted
by the Reich Cabinet.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“SECTION 4. Treaties of the Reich with foreign states
which concern matters of national legislation do not require
the consent of the bodies participating in legislation.
The Reich Cabinet is empowered to issue the necessary provisions
for the execution of these treaties.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“SECTION 5. This law becomes effective on the day of its
publication. It becomes invalid on April 1, 1937; it further
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
becomes invalid when the present Reich Cabinet is replaced
by another.” (<span class='it'>2001-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The time limit stated in the law was twice extended by action of
the Reichstag and once by decree of Hitler. (<span class='it'>2047-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2048-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2103-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 29 June 1933, Dr. Hugenberg resigned as Reich Minister
of Economy and as Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture
(<span class='it'>351-PS</span>). Thereafter, other members of the Cabinet resigned
from time to time, and new members were added. The Reich Cabinet
continued to exercise, on numerous occasions the plenary
powers conferred on it by the law of 24 March 1933. (See Section
3 of Chapter XV for further material on the Reich Cabinet.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators caused all political parties, except
the Nazi Party, to be prohibited.</span> After the Reichstag fire of 27
February 1933, the organization of the Communist Party was
destroyed. On 9 March 1933, the Reich Minister of the Interior,
Frick, announced that the Communists would be prevented from
taking part in the opening of the Reichstag on 21 March 1933,
because of their seditious activity. On 26 May 1933, a law was
promulgated, signed by Hitler and Frick, providing for the confiscation
of Communist property. (<span class='it'>2403-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1396-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>After suspension of the Constitutional guarantees of freedom
on 28 February 1933, numerous restraints were imposed on the
Social Democratic Party, including the arrest of a number of its
leaders and Reichstag deputies. The backbone of this Party was
broken by the occupation of the trade union buildings and the
smashing of free trade unions in May 1933. On 22 June 1933,
the Social Democratic Party was suppressed in Prussia (<span class='it'>2403-PS</span>).
On 7 July 1933 a Reich decree eliminated Social Democrats
from the Reichstag and from the governing bodies of Provinces
and Municipalities. (<span class='it'>2058-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 14 July 1933, provisions of the Law of 26 May 1933 confiscating
Communist property were made applicable to assets and
interests of the Social Democratic Party and its affiliated organizations,
“and also to assets and interests which are used or
destined to promote Marxist or other activities found by the
Reich Minister of the Interior to be subversive to people and
state.” (<span class='it'>1388-PS</span>) Faced with similar pressure, the other German
Parties either dissolved or combined with the Nazis (<span class='it'>2403-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators then promulgated a law declaring the
Nazi Party to be the only political party in Germany and making
it criminal to maintain any other political party or to form a new
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
political party. This law, which was signed by Hitler, Frick,
and Guertner, provided in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Art. 1</p>

<p class='noindent'>The National Socialist German Worker’s Party (<span class='it'>National-Sozialistische
Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</span>) constitutes the only
political party in Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Art. 2</p>

<p class='noindent'>Whoever undertakes to maintain the organizational structure
of another political party or to form a new political
party will be punished with penal servitude up to three years
or with imprisonment of from six months to three years, if
the deed is not subject to a greater penalty according to
other regulations.” (<span class='it'>1388-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In a speech on 6 July 1933 Hitler stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The political parties have finally been abolished. This is a
historical occurrence, the meaning and implication of which
one cannot yet be fully conscious of. Now, we must set aside
the last vestige of democracy, particularly the methods of
voting and making majority decisions which today are used
in local governments, in economic organizations and in labor
boards; in its place we must validate the responsibility of
the individual. The achievement of external power must be
followed by the inner-education of the people * * *”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Later in the same speech, Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Party has become the State. All power lies with the
Reich Authorities.” (<span class='it'>2632-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators caused the Nazi Party to be established
as a para-governmental organization with extensive and
extraordinary privileges.</span> On 1 December 1933 the Reich Cabinet
promulgated a law designed for “Securing the Unity of Party
and State”. It was signed by Hitler and Frick, and provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Art. 1</p>

<p class='noindent'>1. After the victory of the National Socialistic Revolution,
the National Socialistic German Labor Party is the bearer
of the concept of the German State and is inseparably the
state.</p>

<p class='noindent'>2. It will be a part of the public law. Its organization
will be determined by the Fuehrer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Art. 2</p>

<p class='noindent'>The deputy of the Fuehrer and the Chief of Staff of the SA
will become members of the Reichs government in order to
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
insure close cooperation of the offices of the party and SA
with the public authorities.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Art. 3</p>

<p class='noindent'>1. The members of the National Socialistic German Labor
Party and the SA (including their subordinate organizations)
as the leading and driving force of the National Socialist
State will bear greater responsibility toward Fuehrer,
people and state.</p>

<p class='noindent'>2. In case they violate these duties, they will be subject to
special jurisdiction by party and state.</p>

<p class='noindent'>3. The Fuehrer may extend these regulations in order to
include members of other organizations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Art. 4</p>

<p class='noindent'>Every action or neglect on the part of members of the SA
(including their subordinate organizations) attacking or endangering
the existence, organization, activity or reputation
of the National Socialistic German Labor Party, in particular
any infraction against discipline and order, will be
regarded as a violation of duty.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Art. 5</p>

<p class='noindent'>Custody and arrest may be inflicted in addition to the usual
penalties.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Art. 6</p>

<p class='noindent'>The public authorities have to grant legal and administrative
assistance to the offices of the Party and the SA which are
entrusted with the execution of the jurisdiction of the Party
and SA.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Art. 7</p>

<p class='noindent'>The law regarding the authority to inflict penalties on members
of the SA and SS, of the 28 April 1933 (RGBl, p. 230),
will be invalidated.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Art. 8</p>

<p class='noindent'>The Reichs Chancellor, as Fuehrer of the National Socialistic
German Labor Party and as the supreme commander of SA
will issue the regulation necessary for the execution and augmentation
of this law, particularly with respect to the organization
and procedure of the Jurisdiction of the Party and
SA. He will determine the time at which the regulations
concerning this jurisdiction will be effective.” (<span class='it'>1395-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus the Nazi Party became a para-governmental organization
in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators granted the Nazi Party and its components
extensive and extraordinary privileges. On 19 May 1933,
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
they passed a law to protect and insure respect for Party symbols
(<span class='it'>2759-PS</span>). On 20 December 1934 the Nazi conspirators
caused a law to be promulgated, signed by Hitler, Guertner, Hess,
and Frick, making it a crime to make false or grievous statements
to injure the prestige of the Government of the Reich, the
NSDAP, or its agencies. This law also declared it to be a crime
to wear the uniform or the insignia of the NSDAP without authority
to do so, and controlled the manufacture and sale of Party
uniforms, flags, and insignia (<span class='it'>1393-PS</span>). A decree of 29 March
1935, defining the legal status of the NSDAP and of its components
and affiliated organizations, is a further indication of the
extraordinary privileges enjoyed by the Nazi Party. (<span class='it'>1725-PS</span>)</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg218a'>3. CONSOLIDATION OF TOTALITARIAN POLITICAL CONTROL</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Between the Accession to Power (early 1933) and the Outbreak
of the War (late 1939) the Nazi Conspirators Consolidated
Their Control of Germany by Utilizing and Molding Its Political
Machinery to Their Own Ends.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators reduced the Reichstag to an impotent
body of their own appointees.</span> Under the Weimar Constitution
of the German Reich, adopted by the German people on 11
August 1919, the Reichstag was a representative parliamentary
body with broad legislative powers. Article 20 provided that
the Reichstag should be “composed of the delegates of the German
people.” Article 68 of the Chapter on Legislation provided
that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Bills are introduced by the government of the Reich or by
members of the Reichstag. Reich laws shall be enacted by
the Reichstag.” (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> Hitler stated the conspirators’ purpose to undermine
the Reichstag:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Our young movement in essence and structure is anti-parliamentarian,
i.e., it rejects majority voting as a matter of
principle as well as in its own organization * * * Its
participation in the activities of a parliament has only the
purpose to contribute to its destruction, to the elimination
of an institution which we consider as one of the gravest
symptoms of decay of mankind * * *” (<span class='it'>2883-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>With the passage of the Law for the Protection of the People
and the Reich (also known as the Enabling Act) the Nazi succeeded,
in effect, in depriving the Reichstag of its legislative
functions. The legislative as well as the executive powers of the
government were concentrated in Hitler and the Cabinet (<span class='it'>2001-PS</span>;
the legislative activities of the Cabinet (<span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>)
and its power to contravene constitutional limitations are treated
in Section 3 of Chapter XV).</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the period from March 1933 until the beginning of 1937,
the Reichstag enacted only four laws: The Reconstruction Law of
30 January 1934 and the three Nurnberg laws of 15 September
1935. The Reichstag was retained chiefly as a sounding board
for Hitler’s speeches. All other legislation was enacted by the
Cabinet, by the Cabinet ministers, or by decree of the Fuehrer
(<span class='it'>2481-PS</span>). Hess has admitted the lack of importance of the
Reichstag in the legislative process after 1933. (<span class='it'>2426-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler indicated in a 1939 decree that the Reichstag would be
permitted to enact only such laws as he, in his own judgment,
might deem appropriate for Reichstag legislation. (<span class='it'>2018-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after the Nazis acquired the control of the central
government they proceeded systematically to eliminate their opponents.
First they forced all other political parties to dissolve,
and on 14 July 1933 issued a decree making illegal the existence
of any political party except the Nazi Party. (<span class='it'>1388-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In early 1935 there were 661 delegates in the Reichstag. Of
this number 641 were officially registered as Nazi party members
and the remaining 20 were classified as “guests” (<span class='it'>Gaeste</span>). (<span class='it'>2384-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2380-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators curtailed the freedom of popular
elections throughout Germany.</span> Under the Weimar Republic there
existed constitutional and legislative guarantees of free popular
elections. The Weimar Constitution guaranteed the universal,
equal and secret ballot and proportional representation. (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>)
These general principles were implemented by the provisions
of the Reich Election Law of 1924, particularly with respect to
the multiple party system and the functioning of proportional
representation. (<span class='it'>2382-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> Hitler stated the conspirators’ purpose to subvert
the system of popular election:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Majority can never replace men. * * * The political
understanding of the masses is not sufficiently developed to
produce independently specific political convictions and to
select persons to represent them.” (<span class='it'>2883-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The occasional national elections after 1933 were formalities
devoid of freedom of choice. Bona fide elections could not take
place under the Nazi system. The basic ideological doctrine of
the <span class='it'>Fuehrerprinzip</span> (Leadership Principle) dictated that all subordinates
must be appointed by their superiors in the governmental
hierarchy. In order to insure the practical application of
this principle the Nazis immediately liquidated all other political
parties and provided criminal sanctions against the formation of
new parties. (For further discussion see Section 2 on the Acquisition
of Totalitarian Political Control.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the Reichstag, unlike all other elective assemblies in
Germany, was allowed to continue in existence, elections no longer
involved a free choice between lists or candidates. At these elections
there were usually large bands of uniformed Nazis surrounding
the polls and intimidating the voters. (<span class='it'>2955-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The surreptitious marking of ballots (e.g. with skimmed milk)
was also customary, to ascertain the identity of the persons who
cast “No” or invalid votes. (<span class='it'>R-142</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although it had already become practically impossible to have
more than one list of candidates, it was specifically provided by
law in 1938 that only one list was to be submitted to the electorate.
(<span class='it'>2355-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the end of this period, little of substance remained in the
election law. In an official volume published during the war there
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
are reprinted the still effective provisions of the law of 1924. The
majority of the substantive provisions have been marked “obsolete”
(<span class='it'>gegenstandslos</span>) (<span class='it'>2381-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The comprehensive Nazi program for the centralization of German
government included in its scope the whole system of regional
and local elections, which soon ceased to exist. Article 17
of the Weimar Constitution had required a representative form
of government and universal, secret elections in all Laender and
municipalities (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>). Yet in early 1934, the sovereign powers
(<span class='it'>Hoheitsrechte</span>) of the Laender were transferred by law to
the Reich and the Land governments were placed under the Reich
control:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The popular assemblies (<span class='it'>Volksvertretungen</span>) of the Laender
shall be abolished.” (<span class='it'>2006-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Pursuant to the German Communal Ordinance of 30 January
1935, the mayors and executive officers of all municipalities received
their appointments “through the confidence of Party and
State” (Article 6 (2)). Appointments were made by Reich authorities
from lists prepared by the Party delegates (Article 41).
City councillors were selected by the Party delegates in agreement
with the mayors (Article 51 (1)). (<span class='it'>2008-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators transformed the states, provinces,
and municipalities into what were, in effect, mere administrative
organs of the central government.</span> Under the Weimar Constitution
of the pre-Nazi regime, the states, provinces, and municipalities
enjoyed considerable autonomy in the exercise of governmental
functions—legislative, executive and judicial. (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler, in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, stated the conspirators’ purpose to establish
totalitarian control of local government:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“National Socialism, as a matter of principle, must claim the
right to enforce its doctrines, without regard to present federal
boundaries, upon the entire German nation and to educate
it in its ideas and its thinking. * * * The National
Socialist doctrine is not the servant of political interests of
individual federal states but shall become the ruler of the
German nation.” (<span class='it'>2883-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These views were echoed by Rosenberg:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the midst of the great power constellations of the globe
there must be, for foreign as well as for internal political
reasons, only one strong central national authority, if one
wants Germany to regain a position which makes it fit for
alliance with other countries.” (<span class='it'>2882-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>By a series of laws and decrees, the Nazi conspirators reduced
the powers of the regional and local governments and substantially
transformed them into territorial subdivisions of the Reich
government. The program of centralization began almost immediately
after the Nazis acquired the chief executive posts of
the government. On 31 March 1933, they promulgated the Provisional
Law integrating the Laender with the Reich (<span class='it'>2004-PS</span>).
This law called for the dissolution of all state and local self governing
bodies and for their reconstitution according to the number
of votes cast for each party in the Reichstag election of 5 March
1933. The Communists and their affiliates were expressly denied
representation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week later there followed the Second Law Integrating the
Laender with the Reich (<span class='it'>2005-PS</span>). This Act established the position
of Reich Governor. He was to be appointed by the President
upon the proposal of the Chancellor, and was given power to
appoint the members of the Land governments and the higher
Land officials and judges, the authority to reconstruct the Land
legislature according to the law of 31 March 1933 (<span class='it'>2004-PS</span>, <span class='it'>supra</span>),
and the power of pardon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 31 January 1934, most of the remaining vestiges of Land
independence were destroyed by the Law for the Reconstruction
of the Reich:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The popular referendum and the Reichstag election of November
12, 1933, have proved that the German people have
attained an indestructible internal unity (<span class='it'>unloesliche innere
Einheit</span>) superior to all internal subdivisions of political
character. Consequently, the Reichstag has enacted the following
law which is hereby promulgated with the unanimous
vote of the Reichstag after ascertaining that the requirements
of the Reich Constitution have been met:</p>

<p class='hang'>Article I. Popular assemblies of the Laender shall be abolished.</p>

<p class='hang'>Article II. (1) The sovereign powers (<span class='it'>Hoheitsrechte</span>) of the
Laender are transferred to the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) The Laender governments are placed under the Reich
government.</p>

<p class='hang'>Article III. The Reich governors are placed under the administrative
supervision of the Reich Minister of Interior.</p>

<p class='hang'>Article IV. The Reich Government may issue new constitutional
laws.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This law was implemented by a regulation, issued by Frick, providing
that all Land laws must have the assent of the competent
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
Minister of the Reich, that the highest echelons of the Land Government
were to obey the orders of the competent Reich Minister,
and that the employees of the Laender might be transferred into
the Reich Civil Service. (<span class='it'>1653-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Reichsrat</span> (Reich Council) was abolished by law on 14 February
1934, and all official representation on the part of the Laender
in the administration of the central government was at an
end (<span class='it'>2647-PS</span>). The legislative pattern was complete with the
enactment of the Reich Governor Law on 30 January 1935, which
solidified the system of centralized control. The Reich Governor
was declared to be the official representative of the Reich government,
who was to receive orders directly from Hitler (<span class='it'>Reichstatthaltergesetz</span>
(Reich Governor Law), 30 January 1935, 1935
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, p. 65). The same development
was apparent in the provinces, the territorial subdivisions of
Prussia. All local powers were concentrated in the Provincial
Presidents, who acted solely as representatives of the national
administration (<span class='it'>2049-PS</span>). Similarly, in the case of the municipalities
local self-government was quickly reduced to a minimum
and communal affairs were placed under central Reich control.
The Nazi Party Delegate was given special functions:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * in order to insure harmony between the communal
administration and the Party.” (Art. 6 (2)).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich was given supervision over the municipalities:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * in order to insure that their activities conform
with the laws and the aims of national leadership.” (<span class='it'>2008-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators frequently boasted of their comprehensive
program of government centralization. Frick, Minister of
the Interior throughout this period, wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The reconstruction law abolished the sovereign rights and
the executive powers of the Laender and made the Reich the
sole bearer of the rights of sovereignty. The supreme powers
of the Laender do not exist any longer. The natural result
of this was the subordination of the Land governments
to the Reich government and the Land Ministers to the corresponding
Reich Ministers. On 30 January 1934, the German
Reich became one state. (<span class='it'>2481-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In another article Frick indicated even more clearly the purposes
which underlay this program of centralization:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the National Socialist revolution of 1933, it was stipulated
for the first time in the history of the German nation
that the erection of a unified state (<span class='it'>Einheitsstaat</span>) would be
accomplished. From the early days of his political activity,
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
Adolf Hitler never left a doubt in the mind of anyone that he
considered it the first duty of National Socialism to create a
German Reich in which the will of the people would be led in
a single direction and that the whole strength of the nation,
<span class='it'>at home and abroad</span>, would be placed on the balance scale.”
(<span class='it'>2380-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2378-PS</span>.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators united the offices of President and
Chancellor in the person of Hitler.</span> The merger of the two offices
was accomplished by the law of 1 August 1934, signed by the entire
cabinet (<span class='it'>2003-PS</span>). The official Nazi statement concerning
the effect of this statute contains this observation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Through this law, the conduct of Party and State has been
combined in one hand. * * * He is responsible only to
his own conscience and to the German nation.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>One of the significant consequences of this law was to give to Hitler
the supreme command of the German armed forces, always a
prerequisite of the Presidency (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>). Accordingly, every
soldier was immediately required to take an oath of loyalty and
obedience to Hitler. (<span class='it'>2061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>E. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators removed great numbers of civil
servants on racial and political grounds and replaced them with
party members and supporters.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler publicly announced the conspirators’ purpose:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We know that two things alone will save us: the end of internal
corruption and the cleaning out of all those who owe
their existence simply to the protection of members of the
same political parties. Through the most brutal ruthlessness
towards all officials installed by those political parties we
must restore our finances. * * * The body of German
officials must once more become what it was.” (<span class='it'>2881-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi legislative machine turned to the task of purging the
civil service soon after the accession to power. On 7 April 1933,
the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was
promulgated (<span class='it'>1397-PS</span>). Article 3 of this law applies the Nazi
blood theories:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“(1) Officials who are not of Aryan descent are to be retired
(See Section 8); where honorary officials are concerned, they
are to be discharged from office.</p>

<p class='noindent'>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Does not apply to officials who have been in service
since August 1, 1914, or who fought in the World War at the
front for the German Reich or for its allies or whose fathers
or sons were killed in the World War. The Reich Minister
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
of the Interior after consultation with the competent Minister
or with the highest state authorities may permit further
exceptions in the case of officials who are in foreign countries.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Article 8 provides that retirement does not carry a pension unless
the official has served at least ten years. The political purge provision
of this law is contained in Article 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Officials who because of their previous political activity do
not offer security that they will exert themselves for the national
state without reservations, may be discharged. For
three months after dismissal, they will be paid their former
salary. From this time on they receive three-quarters of
their pensions (see 8) and corresponding annuities for their
heirs.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The provisions of the Act apply to all Reich, Land, and Communal
officials (Art. 1 (2)). Civil Servants may be placed on
the retired list without any reason, “for the purpose of simplifying
the administration” (Art. 6). Discharges and transfers, once
decided on by the appropriate administrative chief, are final and
are not subject to appeal (Art. 7 (1)).</p>

<p class='pindent'>This basic enactment was followed by a series of decrees, regulations,
and amendments. For example, on 11 April 1933, the
term “non-Aryan” was defined to include persons with only one
non-Aryan grandparent (<span class='it'>2012-PS</span>). An amendatory law of
30 June ruled out all civil servants married to non-Aryans.
(<span class='it'>1400-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The political standards of the “Purge Law” were made more
explicit by the supplementary law of 20 July 1933. Officials who
belonged to any party or organization which, in the opinion of
the Nazis, furthered the aims of Communism, Marxism, or Social
Democracy were summarily to be discharged (<span class='it'>1398-PS</span>). In the
later years, these earlier provisions were enlarged and codified,
no longer solely for the purposes of affecting the existing civil
service, but rather to set out the qualifications for the appointment
of new applicants and for their promotion. Proof of devotion
to National Socialism and documentary proof of acceptable
“blood” were prescribed as conditions to promotion. (<span class='it'>2326-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The comprehensive German Civil Service Law of 26 January
1937 included the discriminatory provisions of the earlier legislation,
and prevented the appointment of any applicants opposed
or suspected of being opposed to the Nazi program and policy
(<span class='it'>2340-PS</span>). The legislation dealing with the training and education
of civil servants provided that no person can be accepted for
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
an official position unless he is a member of the Nazi Party or one
of its formations (<span class='it'>Gliederungen</span>). (<span class='it'>2341-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The total subjugation of the German civil servant was ultimately
accomplished by the following resolution passed by the
Reichstag at the request of the Fuehrer.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * without being bound by existing legal provisions,
the Fuehrer must therefore in his capacity as Fuehrer of
the nation, as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, as
Head of the Government and as the highest bearer of all
power, as highest Law Lord and as Fuehrer of the Party,
always be in a position to require every German—whether a
simple soldier or officer, subordinate or higher official, or
judge, supervisory or operating functionary of the Party,
laborer or employer—to carry out his duties with all the
means available to him and to discharge these duties according
to a conscientious examination without reference to so-called
vested rights, especially without the preambles of pre-existing
procedure, by removal of any man from his office,
rank or position.” (<span class='it'>2755-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>F. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators restricted the independence of the
judiciary and rendered it subservient to their ends.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The independence of judges, before the Nazi regime, was guaranteed
by the Weimar Constitution. The fundamental principle
was stated briefly in Article 102:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Judges are independent and subject only to the law.” (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Article 104 contained a safeguard against the arbitrary removal
or suspension of judges, while Article 105 prohibited “exceptional
courts”. The fundamental rights of the individual are set out in
Article 109 and include equality before the law. (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like all other public officials, German judges who failed to
meet Nazi racial and political requirements became the subject
of a wide-spread purge. Non-Aryans, political opponents of the
Nazis, and all persons suspected of antagonism to the aims of the
Party were summarily removed (<span class='it'>2967-PS</span>). The provisions of
the Law for the Restoration of Professional Civil Service of 7
April 1933 applied to all judges. This was declared expressly
in the third regulation for the administration of the law. (<span class='it'>2867-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>To make certain that cases with political ramifications would
be dealt with acceptably and in conformity with Party principles,
the Nazis granted designated areas of criminal jurisdiction to
the so-called Special Courts (<span class='it'>Sondergerichte</span>). These constituted
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
a new system of special criminal courts, independent of the regular
judiciary and directly subservient to the Party (<span class='it'>2076-PS</span>).
A later decree considerably broadened the jurisdiction of these
courts. (<span class='it'>2056-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1934, the People’s Court was set up as a trial court “in cases
of high treason and treason” (<span class='it'>2014-PS</span>). This action was a direct,
result of the dissatisfaction of the Nazi rulers with the decision
of the Supreme Court (<span class='it'>Reichsgericht</span>) in the Reichstag fire
trial. Three of the four defendants were acquitted although the
Nazi conspirators had expected convictions in all cases (<span class='it'>2967-PS</span>).
The law which created this new tribunal contained a wide
definition of treason which would include most of what were
regarded by the Nazis as “political” crimes (Art. 3 (1)). The
express denial of any appeal from the decisions of the People’s
Court (Art. 5 (2)) was a further indication of the intention of
the Nazis to set up a criminal law system totally outside of accepted
judicial pattern. The substantive organization of the
People’s Court was later established by law in 1936. (<span class='it'>2342-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>These new tribunals were staffed almost exclusively with Nazis
and were used to tighten the Party’s grip on Germany. This
control became progressively stronger, due first, to the power of
the prosecutor to pick the appropriate court; second, to the
restriction of defense counsel in these courts to specially admitted
attorneys; and finally, to the absence of appeal from the decisions
of these judges. Moreover, there developed along side of the
entire judicial system the increasingly powerful police administration,
under which persons opposed to the regime were regularly
imprisoned in concentration camps without any type of
hearing, even after acquittal by the courts. (<span class='it'>2967-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still another group of courts was established within the Party
itself. These Party Courts heard cases involving internal party
discipline and infractions of the rules of conduct prescribed for
members of formations and affiliated organizations. The published
rules for the Party judges emphasized the complete dependence
of these judges upon the directions and supervision of
their Party superiors. (<span class='it'>2402-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi legal theorists freely admitted that there was no
place in their scheme of things for the truly independent judge.
They controlled all judges through special directives and orders
from the central government. Frank underscored the role of the
judge as a political functionary and as an administrator in the
National Socialist state (<span class='it'>2378-PS</span>). Two case histories of this
period serve to illustrate the manner in which criminal proceedings
were directly suppressed or otherwise affected by order
of the Reich government.
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1935, the Reich Governor of Saxony, Mutschmann, attempted
to quash criminal proceedings which, in this exceptional instance,
had been brought against officials of the Hohnstein concentration
camp for a series of extremely brutal attacks upon inmates. The
trial was held and the defendants convicted, but during the trial
the governor inquired of the presiding judge whether he did not
think the penalty proposed by the prosecutor too severe and
whether an acquittal was not indicated. After the conviction, two
jurymen were ousted from the NSDAP and the prosecutor was
advised by his superior to withdraw from the SA. Although
Guertner, the then Minister of Justice, strongly recommended
against taking any action to alter the decision, Hitler pardoned
all the accused. (<span class='it'>783-PS</span>; <span class='it'>784-PS</span>; <span class='it'>785-PS</span>; <span class='it'>786-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another similar case, Guertner wrote directly to Hitler narrating
the horrible details of maltreatment and advising that the
case be regularly prosecuted. Nevertheless, Hitler ordered complete
suppression of the proceedings. (<span class='it'>787-PS</span>; <span class='it'>788-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the Nazi regime, it was part of the official duty of many
Party functionaries to supervise the administration of justice. The
official papers of Hess contain detailed statements concerning his
own functions and those of the Gauleiter in deciding criminal
cases. (<span class='it'>2639-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another type of governmental interference in judicial matters
is evidenced by the confidential letter which the Ministry of Justice
sent in early 1938 to the Chief Justices of the Regional Supreme
Courts (<span class='it'>Oberlandesgerichtspraesidenten</span>). The judges
were instructed to submit lists of lawyers who would be sufficiently
able and trustworthy to represent in court persons who
had been taken into “protective custody”. The main requirement
was absolute political reliability. Simple Party membership was
not enough; to be selected, the lawyer had to enjoy the confidence
of the “Gestapo”. (<span class='it'>651-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the war began, Thierack, Minister of Justice, revealed
the low state to which the judiciary had fallen under Nazi rule.
He argued that the judge was not the “supervisor” but the “assistant”
of the government. He said that the word “independent”,
as applied to the judge, was to be eliminated from the vocabulary
and that although the judge should retain a certain freedom of
decision in particular cases, the government “can and must” give
him the “general line” to follow. For this purpose, Thierack
decided in 1942 to send confidential Judge’s Letters (<span class='it'>Richterbriefe</span>)
to all German judges and prosecutors, setting forth the
political principles and directives with which all judicial personnel
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>
were obligated to comply (<span class='it'>2482-PS</span>). The first of these Judge’s
Letters clearly expresses the complete subordination of the judges
to the Fuehrer and his government. (<span class='it'>D-229</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators greatly enlarged existing State and
Party organizations and established an elaborate network of new
formations and agencies.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The totalitarian character of the Nazi regime led to the establishment
of a great number of new official and semi-official agencies
and organizations in the various fields of life which were permeated
by Nazi doctrine and practice, including culture, trade,
industry, and agriculture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>New agencies had to be created to handle the large number of
additional administrative tasks taken over from the Laender and
the municipalities. Moreover, the mobilization of the political,
economic, and military resources of Germany required the formation
of such coordinating “super-agencies” as the Four Year
Plan, the Plenipotentiary for Economics, the Plenipotentiary for
Administration, and the Ministerial Council for the Defense of
the Reich. At the time of the launching of war, the central Reich
government was an extremely complicated structure held together
under strict Nazi dictatorship. (See <span class='it'>Chart Number 18</span>; also
<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2194-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2018-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simultaneously, in the Party, the growth of agencies and organizations
proceeded rapidly. The Party spread, octopus-like,
throughout all Germany and into many foreign lands. (See <span class='it'>Chart
Number 1</span>; also <span class='it'>1725-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This process of growth was summed up late in 1937 in an
official statement of the Party Chancellery:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In order to control the whole German nation in all spheres of
life, the NSDAP, after assuming power, set up under its leadership
the new Party formations and affiliated organizations.”
(<span class='it'>2383-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>H. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators created a dual system of government
controls, set up Party agencies to correspond with State agencies,
and coordinated their activities, often by uniting corresponding
State and Party offices in a single person.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, Hitler announced the conspirators’ purpose:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Such a revolution can and will only be achieved by a movement
which itself is already organized in the spirit of such
ideas and thus in itself already bears the coming state. Therefore,
the National Socialist movement may today become imbued
with these ideas and put them into practice in its own
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
organization so that it not only may direct the state according
to the same principles, but also may be in a position to
put at the state’s disposal the finished organizational structure
of its own state.” (<span class='it'>2883-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis attempted to achieve a certain degree of identity between
the Party and the State and, at the same time, to maintain
two separate organizational structures. After the rise to power,
the fundamental principle of unity was translated into “law”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 1. After the victory of the National Socialistic
Revolution, the National Socialistic German Labor Party is
the bearer of the concept of the German State and is inseparably
the state.” (<span class='it'>1395-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The manner in which the Nazis retained a duality of organization
despite the theory of unity is graphically portrayed in the
charts of the Party and the State (<span class='it'>Charts Number 1 and 18</span>).
These visual exhibits demonstrate the comprehensive character
of the Party organization, which was established on parallel lines
with the corresponding government structure. The Party structure
remained at all times technically separate and could be used
for non-governmental purposes whenever such use best served
the needs of the conspirators. In innumerable instances, the corresponding
Party and State offices were, in fact, held by the same
person. For example, the Gauleiter of the Party in most instances
also held the post of Reich Governor (or, in Prussia,
that of Provincial President). (<span class='it'>2880-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coordination of the Party and State functions started at
the top. The Chief of the Party Chancellery was designated a
Reich Minister and endowed with plenary powers in the preparation
and approval of legislation. He acted as liaison officer at the
highest level between Party officials and cabinet ministers. He
was given also the duty of passing on the appointment of all the
more important civil servants. (<span class='it'>2787-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the same powers were bestowed upon the other
<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> (Leaders composing the Party Directorate). The official
Nazi exposition of their position is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is in the Reich Directorate where the strings of the organization
of the German people and the State meet. By endowment
of the Chief of the Party Chancellery with the
powers of a Reich Minister, and by special administrative
directives, the penetration of the State apparatus with the
political will of the Party is guaranteed. It is the task of the
separate organs of the Reich Directorate to maintain as close
a contact as possible with the life of the nation through their
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
sub-offices in the Gaus. Observations at the front are to be
collected and exploited by the offices of the Reich Directorate.”
(<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the regional and local levels, the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>, etc.,
were also empowered to control the purely governmental authorities
on political matters. Hess issued the following order shortly
after the war began:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I, therefore order that the bearer of sovereignty (<span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>)
of the NSDAP (<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span>)
in the scope of his authority is responsible for the political
leadership and the frame of mind (<span class='it'>Stimmung</span>) of the
population. It is his right and his duty to take or to cause
to be taken any measures necessary for the expeditious fulfillment
of his political duties and for the elimination of
wrong within the Party. He is exclusively responsible to his
superior bearers of sovereignty (<span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>).” (<span class='it'>2383-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the later years, the functional coordination of Party and
State offices became much more common. The appointment of
Himmler as Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police is
a typical example of the way in which State and Party functions
became inextricably merged so as to render any clean lines of demarcation
impossible. (<span class='it'>2073-PS</span>)

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg239a'>4. PURGE OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND TERRORIZATION</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators ruthlessly purged their political opponents.</span>
Soon after the Nazi conspirators had acquired political
control, the defendant Goering, 3 March 1933, stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Fellow Germans, my measures will not be crippled by any
judicial thinking. My measures will not be crippled by any
bureaucracy. Here, I don’t have to give justice, my mission is
only to destroy and exterminate, nothing more! This
struggle, fellow Germans, will be a struggle against chaos
and such a struggle, I shall not conduct with the power of
any police. A bourgeoise state might have done that. Certainly,
I shall use the power of the State and the police to
the utmost, my dear Communists! So you won’t draw any
false conclusions; but the struggle to the death, in which my
fist will grasp your necks, I shall lead with those down there—those
are the Brown Shirts.” (<span class='it'>1856-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In 1934 Heinrich Himmler, the Deputy Leader of the Prussian
Secret State Police, stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We are confronted with a very pressing duty—both the
open and secret enemies of the Fuehrer and of the National
Socialist movement and of our National Revolution must be
discovered, combatted and exterminated. In this duty we are
agreed to spare neither our own blood nor the blood of anyone
else when it is required by our country.” (<span class='it'>2543-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Raymond H. Geist, former American Counsel and First Secretary
of the Embassy in Berlin, Germany 1929-1939, has
stated:
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Immediately in 1933, the concentration camps were established
and put under charge of the Gestapo. Only ‘political’
prisoners were held in concentration camps * * *.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The first wave of terroristic acts began in March 6-13,
1933, accompanied by unusual mob violence. When the Nazi
Party won the elections in March 1933—on the morning of
the 6th—the accumulated passion blew off in wholesale attacks
on the Communists, Jews, and others suspected of being
either. Mobs of SA men roamed the streets, beating up,
looting, and even killing persons * * *.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For Germans taken into custody by the Gestapo * * *
there was a regular pattern of brutality and terror. Victims
numbered in the hundreds of thousands all over Germany.”
(<span class='it'>1759-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Sturmabteilung (SA) had plans for the murder of former
Prime Minister Bruening, but his life was spared through the
negotiations and activities of the defendant Hess and Dr. Haushofer,
President of the Geopolitic Institute of Munich, because they
feared his death might result in serious repercussions abroad.
(<span class='it'>1669-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>From March until October 1933 the Nazi conspirators arrested,
mistreated and killed numerous politicians, Reichstag members,
authors, physicians, and lawyers. Among the persons killed were
the Social Democrat Stolling; Ernst Heilman, Social Democrat
and member of the Prussian Parliament; Otto Eggerstadt, the
former Police President of Altona; and various other persons.
The people killed by the Nazis belonged to various political parties
and religious faiths, such as Democrats, Catholics, Communists,
Jews, and pacifists. The killings were usually camouflaged
by such utterances as “killed in attempting to escape” or “resisting
arrest.” It is estimated that during this first wave of terror
conducted by the Nazi conspirators, between 500 and 700 persons
died. (<span class='it'>2544-PS</span>; see also <span class='it'>2460-PS</span> and <span class='it'>2472-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 June, and 1, 2 July 1934, the Nazi conspirators proceeded
to destroy opposition within their own ranks by wholesale
murder (<span class='it'>2545-PS</span>). In making a formal report of these murders
to the Reichstag on 13 July 1934, Hitler stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The punishment for these crimes was hard and severe.
There were shot 19 higher SA leaders, 31 SA leaders and
SA members and also 3 SS leaders as participants in the plot.
Also 13 SA leaders and civilians who tried to resist arrest
and were killed in the attempt. 3 others committed suicide.
5 members of the Party who were not members of the
SA were shot because of their participation. Finally, 3 SS
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
members were at the same time exterminated because they
had maltreated concentration camp inmates.” (<span class='it'>2572-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In this same speech, Hitler proudly boasted that he gave the order
to shoot the principal traitors and that he had prosecuted thousands
of his former enemies on account of their corruption. He
justified this action by saying,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In this hour I was responsible for the fate of the German
people.” (<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter (People’s Observer), Berlin
ed., issue 195, 14 July 1934, Beiblatt, p. 2.</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The conspirators took advantage of this occasion to eliminate
many opponents indiscriminately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In discussing the Roehm purge, the defendant Frick stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On account of this order, many, many people were arrested
* * * something like a hundred, even more, were even
killed who were accused of high treason. All of this was done
without resort to legal proceedings. They were just killed on
the spot. Many people were killed—I don’t know how many—who
actually did not have anything to do with the putsch.
People who just weren’t liked very well, as, for instance,
SCHLEICHER, the former Reich Chancellor, were killed.
SCHLEICHER’s wife was also killed as was GREGOR
STRASSER, who had been the Reich organization leader and
second man in the Party after Hitler. STRASSER, at the
time he was murdered, was not active in political affairs
anymore. However, he had separated himself from the
Fuehrer in November or December of 1932.” (<span class='it'>2950-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Such a large scale of extermination could not be carried out without
errors. Shortly after the event, the Nazi conspirators arranged
for a Government pension to be paid to one of its citizens,
because “by mistake” the political police had murdered her husband,
Willi Schmidt, who had never engaged in any kind of political
activity. It was believed at the time that the man intended was
Willi Schmidt, an SA leader in Munich, who was later shot on the
same day. (<span class='it'>L-135</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>The Nazi conspirators formally endorsed their murderous purge
within their own ranks by causing the Reichstag to pass a law
declaring that all measures taken in carrying out the purge on
30 June and 1-2 July 1934 were legal as a measure of State
necessity (<span class='it'>2057-PS</span>). Referring to this act of approval on the
part of the Nazi-controlled Reichstag, Goering stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The action of the Government in the days of the Roehm revolt
was the highest realization of the legal consciousness of
the people. Later the action which itself was justified, now
has been made legal by the passage of a law.” (<span class='it'>2496-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Furthermore, the leader of the Nazi conspiracy on 25 July 1934
issued a decree which stated that because of the meritorious service
of the SS, especially in connection with the events of 30 June
1934, the organization was elevated to the standing of an independent
organization within the NSDAP. (<span class='it'>1857-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators used the legislative and judicial
powers of the German Reich to terrorize all political opponents.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>They created a great number of new political crimes.</span> The
decree of 28 February 1933 punished the inciting of disobedience
to orders given out by State or Reich Government authorities or
the provocation of acts “contrary to public welfare.” (<span class='it'>1390-PS</span>)
A month later, in order to give themselves legal justification for
murdering by judicial process their political enemies, the Nazi
conspirators passed a law making the provisions of the above
decree applicable retroactively to acts committed during the
period from 31 January to 28 February 1933. (<span class='it'>2554-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>Referring to these laws, the defendant Goering stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Whoever in the future raises a hand against a representative
of the National Socialist movement or of the State, must
know that he will lose his life in a very short while. Furthermore,
it will be entirely sufficient, if he is proven to have
intended the act, or, if the act results not in a death, but
only in an injury.” (<span class='it'>2494-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 21 March 1933 a decree was issued which provided for penitentiary
imprisonment up to two years for possessing a uniform
of an organization supporting the government of the Nationalist
movement without being entitled thereto, or circulating a statement
which was untrue or greatly exaggerated, or which was apt
to seriously harm the welfare of the Reich or the reputation of
the Government, or of the Party or organizations supporting the
Government. (<span class='it'>1652-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators caused a law to be enacted punishing
whoever undertook to maintain or form a political party other
than the NSDAP. (<span class='it'>1388-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators enacted a law which made it a crime deliberately
to make false or grave statements calculated to injure
the welfare or the prestige of the Reich, or to circulate a statement
manifesting a malicious or low-minded attitude toward leading
personalities of the State or the Party. The law also applied
to statements of this kind which were not made in public, provided
the offender counted on his statements being eventually
circulated in public. (<span class='it'>1393-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>In commenting on the above law, one of the leading Nazi conspirators,
Martin Bormann, stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Although it must absolutely be prevented that martyrs are
created, one must take merciless action against such people,
in whose attacks a bad character or attitude, decisively
inimical to the State, can be recognized. For this purpose, I
request the Gauleiters to report here briefly all crimes, which
must absolutely be punished, and which have become known
to the districts, regardless of the report to be made to the
district attorney’s office * * *.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The district and local leaderships are to be notified accordingly.
However, if it should be decided from wherein this
or that punishable case, that the miscreant is to be given a
simple or strong reprimand by the court, I shall give the
directive for the future, that the Districts are informed of
the names of the persons.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I therefore request, to see to it, that these compatriots be
especially watched by the Ortsgruppen, and that it be attempted,
to influence them in the National Socialist sense.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to place the activities of such
persons, who do not want to be taught, under exact control.
In these cases, it will eventually be necessary, to notify the
Secret State Police.” (<span class='it'>2639-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 24 April 1934 the Nazi conspirators passed a law imposing
the death penalty for “any treasonable act.” Included in the law
was a declaration to the effect that the creating or organizing of
a political party, or continuing of an existing one was a treasonable
act. (<span class='it'>2548-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>By their interpretation and changes of the penal law, the
Nazi conspirators enlarged their terroristic methods.</span> After the
enactment of these new political crimes, the Nazi conspirators
introduced into the penal law the theory of punishment by
analogy. This enabled them legally to punish any act injurious
to their political interests even if no existing statute forbade it.
The culpability of the act and the punishment was determined
by the law most closely relating to or covering the act which was
in force at the time. (<span class='it'>1962-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>In interpreting this law, Dr. Guertner, Reich Minister of Justice,
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“National Socialism substitutes for the idea of formal
wrong, the idea of factual wrong. * * * Even without the
threat of punishment, every violation of the goals toward
which the community is striving is a wrong per se. As a
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
result, the law ceases to be an exclusive source for the determination
of right or wrong.” (<span class='it'>2549-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Referring to the penal code of Nazi Germany, the defendant
Frank stated in 1935:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The National Socialist State is a totalitarian State, it
makes no concessions to criminals, it does not negotiate with
them; it stamps them out.” (<span class='it'>2552-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators also revised the criminal law so that the
State could, within one year after a decree in a criminal case had
become final, apply for a new trial, and the application would be
decided by members of a Special Penal Chamber appointed by
Hitler personally. Thus, if a defendant should be acquitted in a
lower court, the Nazi conspirators could rectify the situation by
another trial. (<span class='it'>2550-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In direct contrast to the severity of the criminal law as it affected
the general population of Germany, the Nazi conspirators
adopted and endorsed a large body of unwritten laws exempting
the police from criminal liability for illegal acts done under
higher authority. This principle was described by Dr. Werner
Best, outstanding Nazi lawyer, in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The police never act in a lawless or illegal manner as long
as they act according to the rules laid down by their superiors
up to the highest governing body. According to its
nature, the police must only deal with what the Government
wants to know is being dealt with. What the Government
wants to know is being dealt with by the police is the essence
of the police law and is that which guides and restricts the
actions of the police. As long as the police carry out the
will of the Government, it is acting legally.” (<span class='it'>1852-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators created a vast system of espionage
into the daily lives of all parts of the population.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>They destroyed the privacy of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic
communications.</span> They enacted a law in February of 1933
providing that violations of privacy of postal, telegraphic, and
telephonic communications were permissible beyond legal limitations.
(<span class='it'>1390-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>Dr. Hans Anschuetz, the present District Court Director (<span class='it'>Landgerichtsdirektor</span>)
at Heidelberg, Germany, recently stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Subsequently, the system of spying upon and supervising
the political opinions of each citizen which permeated the entire
people and private life of Germany, was, of course, also
extended to judges.” (<span class='it'>2967-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>They used the Secret State Police (Gestapo) and the Security
Service (SD) for the purpose of maintaining close surveillance
over the daily activities of all people in Germany.</span> The Gestapo
had as its primary preventive activity the thorough observation
of all enemies of the State, in the territory of the Reich.
(<span class='it'>1956-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>The SD was an intelligence organization which operated out of
various regional offices. It consisted of many hundreds of professional
SD members who were assisted by thousands of honorary
members and informers. These people were placed in all fields of
business, education, State and Party administration, and frequently
performed their duties secretly in their own organization.
This information service reported on the activities of the people.
(<span class='it'>2614-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>Without judicial process, the Nazi conspirators imprisoned,
held in protective custody and sent to concentration camps opponents
and suspected opponents.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>They authorized the Gestapo to arrest and detain without
recourse to any legal proceeding.</span> Officially, this power was described
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Secret State Police takes the necessary police preventive
measures against the enemies of the State on the basis
of the results of the observation. The most effective preventive
measure is without doubt the withdrawal of freedom
which is covered in the form of protective custody. * * *
While protective arrests of short duration are carried out in
police and court prisons, the concentration camps under the
Secret State Police admit those taken into protective custody
who have to be withdrawn from public life for a longer
time.” (<span class='it'>1956-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators issued their own orders for the taking
of people into protective custody and these orders set forth no
further details concerning the reasons therefor, except a statement
such as “Suspicion of activities inimical toward the State.”
(<span class='it'>2499-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant Frank stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“To the world we are blamed again and again because of
the concentration camps. We are asked, ‘Why do you arrest
without a warrant of arrest?’ I say, put yourselves into the
position of our nation. Don’t forget that the very great and
still untouched world of Bolshevism cannot forget that we
have made final victory for them impossible in Europe,
right here on German soil.” (<span class='it'>2533-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant Goering said in 1934:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Against the enemies of the State, we must proceed ruthlessly.
It cannot be forgotten that at the moment of our rise
to power, according to the official election figures of March
1933, six million people still confess their sympathy for Communism
and eight million for Marxism. * * * <span class='it'>Therefore,
the concentration camps have been created, where we
have first confined thousands of Communists and Social
Democrat functionaries.</span> * * *” (<span class='it'>2344-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>U. S. Ambassador George S. Messersmith, former Counsel General
in Berlin, Germany, 1930-34, and Raymond H. Geist, former
American Counsel and First Secretary of the Embassy in Berlin,
Germany, 1929-1939, have recently stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Independent of individual criminal acts committed by high
functionaries of the German government or the Nazi Party,
such as the murders ordered by Hitler, Himmler and Goering,
all high functionaries of the German government and of
the Nazi Party * * * are guilty in the highest degree
of complicity in and furtherance of the cardinal crimes of
oppression against the German people, persecution and destruction
of the Jews and all of their political opponents.”
(<span class='it'>2386-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Commenting further on the Nazi conspirators’ use of concentration
camps to destroy political opposition, Raymond H. Geist
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German people were well acquainted with the goings
on in concentration camps and it was well known that the
fate of anyone too actively opposed to any part of the Nazi
program was liable to be one of great suffering. Indeed, before
the Hitler regime was many months old, almost every
family in Germany had had first-hand accounts of the brutalities
inflicted in the concentration camps from someone
either in the relationship or in the circle of friends who had
served a sentence there; consequently the fear of such camps
was a very effective brake on any possible opposition.”
(<span class='it'>1759-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators confined, under the guise of “protective
custody” Reichstag members, Social Democrats, Communists, and
other opponents or suspected opponents. (<span class='it'>2544-PS</span>; <span class='it'>L-73</span>; <span class='it'>L-83</span>;
<span class='it'>1430-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>E. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators created and utilized special agencies
for carrying out their system of terror.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(See Chapter XV, Sections 5 and 6, on the Gestapo, SS, and
SD)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>F. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators permitted organizations and individuals
to carry out this system of terror without restraint of law.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Acts of the Gestapo were not subject to review by the
courts.</span> In 1935 the Prussian Supreme Court of Administration
held that the orders of the Gestapo were not subject to judicial
review; and that the accused person could appeal only to the next
higher authority within the State Police itself. (<span class='it'>2347-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1936 a law was passed concerning The Gestapo in Prussia
which provided that orders in matters of the Gestapo were not
subject to review of the Administrative Courts. (<span class='it'>2107-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>On the same subject, the following article appeared in the official
German Lawyer’s Journal, 1935.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Once again the court had to decide on the question of
whether political measures could be subjected to the review
of the ordinary courts. * * * The case in question concerned
the official performance of his duty by an official of
the NSDAP. * * * The principle of the importance
and the mission of the Party and its ‘Sovereign Functionaires’
cannot be overlooked. Therefore, the plaintiff should
have been denied the right to be in court.” (<span class='it'>2491-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Where no definite law protected terroristic acts of Nazi
conspirators and their accomplices, proceedings against them
were in the first instance suppressed or thereafter their acts were
pardoned.</span> In 1935, proceedings against an employee of the Gestapo
accused of torturing, beating, and killing of inmates of a
concentration camp were suppressed (<span class='it'>787-PS</span>; <span class='it'>788-PS</span>). In June
1935 twenty-three SA members and policemen convicted of the
beating and murder of inmates of the Hohnstein concentration
camp were pardoned (<span class='it'>786-PS</span>). The prosecutor was forced to
resign from the SA. (<span class='it'>784-PS</span>)

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Before the Nazis took control, organized labor held a well

take part on equal terms” with employers in regulating conditions
of employment. “It was provided that organizations on both
sides and agreements between them shall be recognized.” Factory
Representative Councils (otherwise known as Workmens or Factory
Works Councils) had the right, in conjunction with employers’
representatives, to take an official part in the initiation
and administration of social and economic legislation. (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators conceived that the free trade unions

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It (the trade union) created the economic weapon which

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Soon after coming to power the Nazi conspirators took
drastic action to convert the Factory Representative Councils
into Nazi-controlled organizations.</span> The Nazi conspirators eliminated
the independence of the Factory Representative Councils
by giving the Governors of the Laender authority to cancel the
membership of labor representatives in the councils; by abrogating
the right of the councils to oppose the dismissal of a worker
when he was “suspected of an unfriendly attitude toward the
state” (<span class='it'>1770-PS</span>); and finally by limiting membership in all Factory
Representative Councils to Nazis (<span class='it'>2336-PS</span>). (After 7 April
1933, the Governors of the Laender were appointed by the Reich
President “upon the proposal of the Reich Chancellor,” Hitler,
<span class='it'>2005-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Soon after coming to power the Nazi conspirators proceeded
to destroy the independent unions.</span> In mid-April 1933, Hitler
directed Dr. Robert Ley, then staff director of the PO (Political
Organization) of the NSDAP, to take over the trade unions.
(<span class='it'>2283-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ley issued an NSDAP circular directive on 21 April 1933 detailing
a “coordination action” (<span class='it'>Gleichschaltunsaktion</span>) to be
taken on 2 May 1933 against the General German Trade Union
Federation (ADGB) and the General Independent Employees Federation
(AFA), the so-called “Free Trade Unions” (<span class='it'>392-PS</span>).
This directive created a special “Action Committee” to direct the
entire action and declared that the supporters of the action were
to be drawn from the National Socialist Factory Cells Organization
or NSBO (<span class='it'>Nationalsozialistiche Betriebszellen-Organisation</span>),
the NSDAP political leaders (<span class='it'>Politische Leiter</span>) in the factories;
it named NSDAP commissars for the administration of
the larger ADGB unions to be seized in the action; it made the
Gauleaders (<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>) of the NSDAP responsible for the disciplined
execution of the action in their respective areas and authorized
them to nominate additional commissars to administer
the unions subjected to the action. The directive ordered that
SA and SS were to be used in occupying union offices and the
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
Bank of Workers, Employees and Officials, Inc., and for taking
into protective custody the higher union leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The order of seizure was carried out as planned and ordered.
On 2 May the official NSDAP press service reported that the
NSBO had “eliminated the old leadership” of Free Trade Unions
and taken over their leadership. (<span class='it'>2224-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 3 May 1933 the NSDAP press service announced that the
Central League of Christian Trade Unions (<span class='it'>Gesamtverband der
Christlichen Gewerkschaften</span>) and several smaller unions “have
unconditionally subordinated themselves to the leadership of
Adolf Hitler” (<span class='it'>2225-PS</span>). The next day the NSDAP press stated
that the German Nationalist Clerks League (DHV) had also “recognized
the leadership of the NSDAP in German trade union affairs
* * * after a detailed conversation” between Dr. Ley
and the leader of the DHV (<span class='it'>2226-PS</span>). In late June 1933, as a
final measure against the Christian Trade Unions, Ley directed
that all their offices were to be occupied by National Socialists.
(<span class='it'>392-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duress practiced by the Nazi conspirators in their assumption
of absolute control over the unions is shown by a proclamation
of Muchow, leader of the organizational office of the German
Labor Front, in late June 1933. By this Party proclamation, all
associations of workers not yet “concentrated” in the German
Labor Front had to report within eight days. Thereafter they
were to be notified of the branch of the German Labor Front
which “they will have to join”. (<span class='it'>2228-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>The Nazi Conspirators eliminated the right of collective
bargaining generally.</span> During the same months in which the
unions were abolished, a decree eliminated collective bargaining
on conditions of employment and substituted regulation by “trustees
of labor” (<span class='it'>Treuhaender der Arbeit</span>) appointed by Hitler.
(<span class='it'>405-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators confiscated all union funds and
property.</span> The NSDAP circular ordering the seizure of the Free
Trade Unions on 2 May 1933 directed that the SA and SS were
to be used to occupy the branches and paying offices of the Bank
for Workers, Employees and Officials and appointed a Nazi commissar,
Mueller, for the bank’s subsequent direction. The stock of
this bank was held entirely by the General German Trade Union
Association and its affiliated member unions. The NSDAP circular
also directed that all union funds were to be blocked until
re-opened under the authority and control of NSDAP-appointed
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
commissars (<span class='it'>392-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2895-PS</span>). The Fuehrer’s basic order on
the German Labor Front of the NSDAP in October 1934 declared
that all the property of the trade unions and their dependent organizations
constituted (<span class='it'>bildet</span>) property of the German Labor
Front (<span class='it'>2271-PS</span>). Referring to the seizure of the property of the
unions in a speech at the 1937 Party Congress, Ley mockingly
declared that he would have to be convicted if the former trade
union leaders were ever to demand the return of their property.
(<span class='it'>1678-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators persecuted union leaders.</span> The
NSDAP order on the seizure of the “Free Trade Unions” directed
that the chairmen of the unions were to be taken into “protective
custody”. Lesser leaders could be arrested with the permission
of the appropriate Gau leader of the NSDAP (<span class='it'>392-PS</span>). In
late June 1933 the German Labor Front published a “List of Outlaws”
who were to be denied employment in the factories. The
List named union leaders who had been active in combatting National
Socialism and who allegedly continued to carry on their
resistance secretly. (<span class='it'>2336-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators subjected union leaders to maltreatment
ranging from assaults to murder. Among the offenses committed
against union leaders are the following: assault and battery; degrading
work and work beyond their physical capacity; incarceration
in concentration camps; solitary confinement; denial of
adequate food; surveillance; arrest and maltreatment of members
of their families; murder. (<span class='it'>2330-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2331-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2335-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2334-PS</span>;

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators introduced the Leadership Principle
into industrial relations.</span> In January 1934, a decree introduced
the Leadership Principle (<span class='it'>Fuehrerprinzip</span>) into industrial relations,
the entrepreneur becoming the leader and the workers becoming
his followers. (<span class='it'>1861-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators supplanted independent unions by an
affiliated Party organization, the German Labor Front (DAF).</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>They created the German Labor Front.</span> On the day the
Nazis seized the Free Trade Unions, 2 May 1933, they publicly
announced that a “united front of German workers” with Hitler
as honorary patron would be formed at a Workers’ Congress on
10 May 1933. (<span class='it'>2224-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ley was appointed “leader of the German Labor Front”
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
(<span class='it'>Deutsche Arbeitsfront</span>, or “DAF”) on 10 May 1933 (<span class='it'>1940-PS</span>).
The German Labor Front succeeded to the confiscated property of
the suppressed trade union. It was an affiliated organization
of the NSDAP, subject to the Leadership Principle; Ley was concurrently
Reich Organization Leader (<span class='it'>Reichsorganisationsleiter</span>)
and leader of the German Labor Front (<span class='it'>1814-PS</span>). The National
Socialist Factory Cells Organization or NSBO contained
the political leaders (<span class='it'>Politische Leiter</span>) of the NSDAP in the
German Labor Front and those political leaders were given first
preference in the filling of jobs in the DAF (<span class='it'>2271-PS</span>). The
German Labor Front became the largest of the Party’s organizations.
At the outbreak of the war it had 23 million individual
members and about 10 million corporative members who were
members of organizations affiliated with it. (<span class='it'>2275-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>They utilized the German Labor Front as an instrument to
impose their ideology on the masses, to frustrate potential resistance,
and to insure effective control of the productive labor capacity
of Germany.</span> The DAF was charged with the ideological orientation
of the broad masses of Germans working in the factories.
Its leaders were charged with weeding out potential opponents to
National Socialism from the ranks of the DAF and from employment
in industry. In its surveillance functions, the German
Labor Front relied on Gestapo reports and on its own intelligence
service (<span class='it'>2336-PS</span>). The German Labor Front took over the
leadership of the German Cooperatives with the view to their
subsequent liquidation (<span class='it'>2270-PS</span>). The Nazi conspirators established
Factory Troops (<span class='it'>Werkscharen</span>) within the Strength
Through Joy branch of the German Labor Front as an “ideological
shock squad (<span class='it'>Weltanschaulicher Stosstrupp</span>) within the factory”
(<span class='it'>1817-PS</span>). These shock squads were formed only of voluntary
members ready “to fight” for Nazi conceptions. Among
their objects were the speeding up of labor effort and the forging
of a “single-willed community” (<span class='it'>1818-PS</span>). The SA was charged
with the promotion and building up of Factory Troops by all
means. When a factory worker joined the Factory Troops, he
automatically became an SA candidate. Factory Troops were
given a special uniform and their physical training took place
within SA cadre units. (<span class='it'>2230-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the war, the German Labor Front was made responsible
for the care of foreign labor employed within the Reich
(<span class='it'>1913-PS</span>). Barely two years after the suppression of the independent
unions and the creation of the German Labor Front, the
Nazi conspirators decreed compulsory labor service (<span class='it'>Reichsarbeitsdienst</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
under which young men and women between 18 and
25 years of age were conscripted for labor service under the administration
of the Reich Minister of Interior, Frick. (<span class='it'>1389-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>After war had been declared, the Nazi conspirators openly admitted
the objectives of the Nazis’ control over labor. A publication
of the Scientific Institute of the German Labor Front declared
that it had been difficult to make the German people understand
continuous renunciations in social conditions because all
the nation’s strength had been channeled into armaments
(<span class='it'>Wehrhaftigkeit</span>) for “the anticipated clash with an envious
surrounding world” (<span class='it'>2276-PS</span>). Addressing workers five days
after the launching of war on Poland, Ley admitted that the
Nazis had mobilized all the resources and energies of Germany
for seven years “so as to be equipped for the supreme effort of
battle” and that the First World War had not been lost because
of cowardice of German soldiers, “but because dissension and
discord tore the people asunder” (<span class='it'>1939-PS</span>). Ley’s confidence in
the Nazis’ effective control over the productive labor capacity
of Germany in peace or war was declared as early as 1936 to
the Nurnberg Party Congress:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The idea of the Factory Troops is making good progress
in the plants, and I am able to report to you, my Fuehrer,
that security and peace in the factories has been guaranteed,
not only in normal times, but also in times of the most serious
crisis. Disturbances such as the munitions strikes of
the traitors Ebert and confederates, are out of the question.
<span class='it'>National Socialism has conquered the factories. Factory
Troops are the National Socialist shock troops within the
factory, and their motto is: THE FUEHRER IS ALWAYS
RIGHT.</span>” (<span class='it'>2283-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators sought to subvert the influence of
the churches over the people of Germany.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>They sought to eliminate the Christian Churches in Germany.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Statements of this aim.</span> Martin Bormann stated in a secret
decree of the Party Chancellery signed by him and distributed to
all Gauleiters 7 June 1941:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Our National Socialist ideology is far loftier than the concepts
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
of Christianity, which in their essential points have
been taken over from Jewry * * *. A differentiation
between the various Christian confessions is not to be made
here * * * the Evangelical Church is just as inimical
to us as the Catholic Church. * * * All influences which
might impair or damage the leadership of the people exercised
by the Fuehrer with the help of the NSDAP must be
eliminated. More and more the people must be separated
from the churches and their organs the pastors. * * *
Just as the deleterious influences of astrologers, seers and
other fakers are eliminated and suppressed by the State, so
must the possibility of church influence also be totally removed.
* * * Not until this has happened, does the
state leadership have influence on the individual citizens. Not
until then are the people and Reich secure in their existence
for all time.” (<span class='it'>D-75</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hans Kerrl, Reich Minister for Church Affairs, in a letter
dated 6 September 1939 to a Herr Stapel, which indicated that it
would be brought to the attention of the Confidential Council and
of the defendant Hess, made the following statements:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer considers his efforts to bring the Evangelical
Church to reason, unsuccessful and the Evangelical Church
with respect to its condition rightfully a useless pile of
sects. As you emphasize the Party has previously carried on
not only a fight against the political element of the Christianity
of the Church, but also a fight against membership of
Party Members in a Christian confession. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Catholic Church will and must, according to the law
under which it is set up, remain a thorn in the flesh of a Racial
State * * *.” (<span class='it'>129-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Gauleiter Florian, in a letter dated 23 September 1940 to the
defendant Hess, stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The churches with their Christianity are the danger against
which to fight is absolutely necessary.” (<span class='it'>064-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Regierungsrat Roth, in a lecture 22 September 1941, to a group
of Security Police, in the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA)
concluded his address on Security Police (<span class='it'>Sipo</span>) measures for
combatting church politics and sects with the following remarks:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The immediate aim: the church must not regain one inch
of the ground it has lost. The ultimate aim: Destruction of
the Confessional Churches to be brought about by the collection
of all material obtained through the intelligence service
(<span class='it'>Nachrichtendienst</span>) activities which will at a given time be
produced as evidence for the charge of treasonable activities
during the German fight for existence.” (<span class='it'>1815-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Party Organization Book states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Bravery is valued by the SS man as the highest virtue of
men in a struggle for his ideology.
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“He openly and unrelentingly fights the most dangerous enemies
of the State; Jews, Free Masons, Jesuits, and political
clergymen.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“However, he recruits and convinces the weak and inconstant
by his example, who have not been able to bring themselves
to the National Socialistic ideology.” (<span class='it'>1855-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators promoted beliefs and practices incompatible
with Christian teachings.</span> The 24th point of the
Program of the NSDAP, unchanged since its adoption in 1920,
is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We demand freedom of religion for all religious denominations
within the state so long as they do not endanger its
existence or oppose the moral senses of the germanic race.
The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a positive
Christianity without binding itself confessionally to any one
denomination. It combats the Jewish materialistic spirit
within and around us, and is convinced that a lasting recovery
of our nation can only succeed from within on the framework:
common utility precedes individual utility.” (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In official correspondence with the defendant Rosenberg in
1940, Bormann stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Christian religion and National Socialist doctrines are not
compatible. * * * The churches cannot be subjugated
through compromise, only through a new philosophy as
prophesied in Rosenberg’s works.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>He then proposed creation of a National Socialist Catechism to
provide a “moral foundation” for a National Socialist religion
which is gradually to supplant the Christian churches. He stated
the matter was so important it should be discussed with members
of the Reich Cabinet as soon as possible and requested Rosenberg’s
opinion before the meeting. (<span class='it'>098-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a secret decree of the Party Chancellery, signed by Bormann
and distributed to all <span class='it'>Gauleiters</span> on 7 June 1941, the following
statements appeared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When we National Socialists speak of a belief in God, we
do not understand by God, like naive Christians and their
spiritual opportunists, a human-type being, who sits around
somewhere in the sphere * * *. The force of natural law,
with which all these innumerable planets move in the universe,
we call the Almighty, or God. The claim that this
world force * * * can be influenced by so-called prayers or
other astonishing things is based upon a proper dose of
naiveté or on a business shamelessness.
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“As opposed to that we National Socialists impose on ourselves
the demand to live naturally as much as possible, i.e.,
biologically. The more accurately we recognize and observe
the laws of nature and of life, the more we adhere to them,
so much the more do we conform to the will of the Almighty.
The more insight we have into the will of the Almighty, the
greater will be our successes.” (<span class='it'>D-75</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg in his book “The Myth of the 20th Century” advocated
a new National Socialist faith or religion to replace the
Christian confessions in Germany. He stated that the Catholic
and Protestant churches represent “negative Christianity” and
do not correspond to the soul of the “Nordic racially determined
peoples”; that a German religious movement would have to declare
that the idea of neighborly love is unconditionally subordinated
to national honor; that national honor is the highest
human value and does not admit of any equal valued force such
as Christian love. He predicted:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“A German religion will, bit by bit, present in the churches
transferred to it, in place of the crucifixion the spirit of fire—the
heroic—in the highest sense.” (<span class='it'>2349-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Labor Service (<span class='it'>Reichsarbeitsdienst</span>), a National Socialist
youth organization, was prohibited from participating in
religious celebrations of any kind, and its members were instructed
to attend only the parts of such ceremonies as weddings
and funerals which took place before or after the church celebration.
(<span class='it'>107-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators considered religious literature undesirable
for the Wehrmacht. National Socialist publications were
prepared for the Wehrmacht for the expressed purpose of replacing
and counteracting the influence of religious literature dissimulated
to the troops. (<span class='it'>101-PS</span>; <span class='it'>100-PS</span>; <span class='it'>064-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators through Rosenberg’s Office for Supervision
of the Ideological Training and Education of the NSDAP
and the Office of the Deputy of the Fuehrer “induced” the substitution
of National Socialist mottoes and services for religious
prayers and services in the schools of Germany. (<span class='it'>070-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 14 July 1939, Bormann, as Deputy of the Fuehrer, issued a
Party regulation excluding clergymen, persons closely connected
with the church, and Theology students from membership in the
Party. It was further decreed that in the future Party Members
who entered the clergy or turned to the study of Theology must
leave the Party. (<span class='it'>840-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators persecuted priests, clergy and members
of monastic orders.</span> The priests and clergy of Germany were
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
subjected by the police to systematic espionage into their daily
lives. The Nazi conspirators through the Chief of the Reich Main
Security Office (RSHA) maintained a special branch of the Security
Police and Security Service (Sipo/SD) whose duties were
to investigate the churches and maintain constant surveillance
upon the public and private lives of the clergy. (<span class='it'>1815-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a conference of these police “church specialists” called by
Heydrich, who was then SS Gruppenfuehrer and Chief of the
Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), in Berlin, 23 September
1941, SS Sturmbannfuehrer Hartl, acting for Heydrich, stated
that the greatest importance was to be attached to church political
activity. The intelligence network in this field, he continued,
was to be fostered with the greatest of care and enlarged with the
recruitment of informants, particular value being attached to contacts
with church circles. He closed his lecture with the following
words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Each of you must go to work with your whole heart and a
true fanaticism. Should a mistake or two be made in the execution
of this work, this should in no way discourage you,
since mistakes are made everywhere. The main thing is that
the enemy should be constantly tackled with determination,
will, and effective initiative.” (<span class='it'>1815-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter of 22 October 1941, Heydrich, as Chief of the Reich
Main Security Office (RSHA) issued detailed instructions to all
State Police Offices outlining the organization of the Catholic
Church and directing close surveillance of the activities, writings,
and reports of the Catholic clergy in Germany. In this connection
he directed:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Reports are also to be submitted on those Theological students
destined for Papal Institutes, and Priests returning
from such institutes to Germany. Should the opportunity
arise of placing someone for intelligence (<span class='it'>Nachrichtendienst</span>)
purposes in one of these Institutes, in the guise of a Theological
student, we should receive immediate notification.”
(<span class='it'>1815-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Priests and other members of the clergy were arrested, fined,
imprisoned, and otherwise punished by executive measures of the
police without judicial process. In his lecture before a conference
at the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) in Berlin, for “church
specialists,” of the Security Police, 22 November 1941, <span class='it'>Regierungsrat</span>
Roth stated (<span class='it'>1815-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It has been demonstrated that it is impracticable to deal
with political offenses (malicious) under normal legal procedure.
Owing to the lack of political perception which still
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
prevails among the legal authorities, suspension of this procedure
must be reckoned with. The so-called “Agitator-Priests”
must therefore be dealt with in future by Stapo
measures, and, if the occasion arises, be removed to a Concentration
Camp, if agreed upon by the RSHA.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The necessary executive measures are to be decided upon
according to local conditions, the status of the person accused,
and the seriousness of the case—as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Members of monastic orders were forced by the seizure and
confiscation of their properties to give up their established place
of abode and seek homes elsewhere (<span class='it'>R-101-A</span>; <span class='it'>R-101-D</span>). A secret
order of the SS Economic Administration Office to all Concentration
Camp Commanders, dated 21 April 1942, concerning
labor mobilization of clergy, reveals that clergymen were at that
time, and had previously been, incarcerated in Concentration
Camps. (<span class='it'>1164-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the death of von Hindenburg, the Reich Government ordered
the ringing of all church bells on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th August
1934. In Bavaria, there were many instances of failure to
comply with this order. The Bavarian police submitted a report
outlining the above situation and stating that in three cases the
taking into protective custody of recalcitrant clergy could not
be avoided.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Parish priest, Father Johann Quinger of Altenkunstadt
BA Lichtenfels. He was taken into protective custody
on 3 August on the express order of the State Ministry of
the Interior, because he assaulted SA leaders and SA men
who were ringing the bells against his wishes. He was released
from custody on 10 August 1934.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Parish priest, Father Ludwig Obholzer of Kiefersfelden,
BA Rosenheim. For his personal safety he was in police
custody from 2400 hours on the 2 August 1934, till 1000
hours on 3 August 1934. On 5 August 1934, he said sarcastically
in his sermon, referring to the SA men who had carried
out the ringing of the funeral knell on their own account,
‘Lord forgive them, for they know not what they do’!
“The Parish priest, Father Johann Nepomuk Kleber of Wiefelsdorf,
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
BA Burglengenfeld, refused to ring the church bells
on the 2nd and 3rd. He is badly tainted politically and had
to be taken into protective custody from the 5th to the 8th
of August 34 in the interests of his own safety.” (<span class='it'>1521-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After Hitler’s rise to power, Bishop Sproll of Rottenburg delivered
a series of sermons regarded by the Nazis as damaging,
and on 10 April 1938 he refrained from voting in the plebiscite.
For this, the Reich Governor of Wuertemberg declared he would
no longer regard Bishop Sproll as head of the Diocese of Rottenburg;
made an official request that he leave the Gau; and declared
he would see to it that all personal and official intercourse between
the Bishop and the State and Party offices as well as the Armed
Forces would be denied (<span class='it'>849-PS</span>). For his alleged failure to
vote in the plebiscite, of 10 April 1938, the Party caused three
demonstrations to be staged against the Bishop and his household
in Rottenburg. The third demonstration was described as
follows in a teletype message from Gestapo Office Stuttgart to
Gestapo Office Berlin:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Party on 23 July 1938 from 2100 on carried out the
third demonstration against Bishop Sproll. Participants about
2,500-3,000 were brought in from outside by bus, etc. The
Rottenburg populace again did not participate in the demonstration.
The town took rather a hostile attitude to the
demonstrations. The action got completely out of hand of
the Party Member responsible for it. The demonstrators
stormed the palace, beat in the gates and doors. About 150
to 200 people forced their way into the palace, searched the
rooms, threw files out of the windows and rummaged through
the beds in the rooms of the palace. One bed was ignited.
Before the fire got to the other objects of equipment in the
rooms and the palace, the flaming bed could be thrown from
the window and the fire extinguished. The Bishop was with
Archbishop Groeber of Freiburg and the ladies and gentlemen
of his menage in the chapel at prayer. About 25 to 30
people pressed into this chapel and molested those present.
Bishop Groeber was taken for Bishop Sproll. He was grabbed
by the robe and dragged back and forth. Finally the intruders
realized that Bishop Groeber is not the one they are
seeking. They could then be persuaded to leave the building.
After the evacuation of the palace by the demonstrators I
had an interview with Archbishop Groeber, who left Rottenburg
in the night. Groeber wants to turn to the Fuehrer
and Reich Minister of the Interior Dr. Frick anew. On the
course of the action, the damage done as well as the homage
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
of the Rottenburg populace beginning today for the Bishop
I shall immediately hand in a full report, after I am in the
act of suppressing counter mass meetings.” (<span class='it'>848-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Reich Minister for Church Affairs Kerrl and other Party officials
alleged that these demonstrations were spontaneously staged by
indignant citizens of Rottenburg and caused representations to
be made to the Holy See in an effort to effect the Bishop’s removal
from office. (<span class='it'>849-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On or about 3 December 1941, a copy of a secret decree of the
Party Chancellery on the subject of Relationship of National Socialism
to Christianity was found by the Security Police in the
possession of Protestant Priest Eichholz at Aix-la-Chapelle. For
this he was arrested and held for questioning for an unknown
period of time. (<span class='it'>D-75</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators confiscated church property.</span> On 20
January 1938, the Gestapo District Office at Munich issued a decree
dissolving the Guild of the Virgin Mary of the Bavarian Diocese,
together with its branches and associations. The decree
also stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The property belonging to the dissolved Guild is to be confiscated
by the police. Not only is property in cash to be
confiscated, but also any stock on hand and other objects of
value. All further activity is forbidden the dissolved Guilds,
particularly the foundation of any organization intended as
a successor or as a cover. Incorporation as a body into other
women’s societies is also to be looked on as a forbidden continuation
of activity. Infringements against the above prohibition
will be punished according to par. 4 of the order of
28.2.1933.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The reasons for the dissolution and confiscation were that the
Guild of the Virgin Mary had occupied itself for years “to a most
far-reaching degree” with arrangements of a “worldly and popular
sporting character” such as community games and “social evenings”;
and further that the president of the society supplied the
members with “seditious materials” which served for “seditious
discussions”; and that the members of the Guild were trained
and mobilized for “political and seditious tasks.” (<span class='it'>1481-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a lecture delivered to a conference of police investigators of
Church Affairs assembled in the lecture hall of the Reich Main
Security Office (RSHA) in Berlin, 22 September 1941, <span class='it'>Regierungsrat</span>
Roth stated that about 100 monasteries in the Reich had
been dissolved and pointed out that the proper procedure called
for seizure of the churches at the same time the monasteries were
dissolved. (<span class='it'>1815-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In February 1940, SS Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich suggested to
Himmler the seizure of monasteries for the accommodation of
Racial Germans. He proposed that the authorities of the monastic
orders be instructed to make the monasteries concerned available
and move their own members to less populous monasteries.
He pointed out that the final expropriation of properties thus
placed at their disposal could be carried out step by step in the
course of time. Himmler agreed to this proposal and ordered the
measure to be carried out by the Security Police and Security
Service (<span class='it'>Sipo</span> and SD) in collaboration with the Reich Commissioner
for Consolidation of German Folkdom. (<span class='it'>R-101-A</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>These orders for confiscation were carried out, as revealed in
a letter dated 30 March 1942 from the Reich Main Security Office
(RSHA) Chief of Staff to Himmler mentioning claims for compensation
pending in a number of confiscation cases. In this
letter he stated that all rental payments to those monasteries and
ecclesiastical institutions whose premises had been put to use as
camps for resettlers had been stopped on receipt of Himmler’s
order. Concerning current developments, he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“After further preparations in which the Party Chancellery
participated prominently, the Reich Minister of the Interior
found a way which makes it possible to seize ecclesiastical
premises practically without compensation and yet avoids
the impression of being a measure directed against the
Church. * * *” (<span class='it'>R-101-D</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter of 19 April 1941, Bormann advised Rosenberg that
libraries and art objects of the monasteries confiscated in the
Reich were to remain for the time being in these monasteries and
that the Fuehrer had repeatedly rejected the suggestion that
centralization of all such libraries be undertaken. (<span class='it'>072-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators suppressed religious publications.</span>
On 6 November 1934, Frick, as Reich and Prussian Minister of
the Interior, issued an order forbidding until further notice publication
of all announcements in the daily press, in pamphlets and
other publications, which dealt with the Evangelical Church;
with the exception of official announcements of the Church Government
of the Reich. (<span class='it'>1498-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By order of the State Police for the District of Duesseldorf,
the Police Regulation which is quoted in part below was promulgated
28 May 1934:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The distribution and sale of published items of any sort in

of processions, pilgrimages and similar church institutions
in the streets or squares they pass through or in
their vicinity is prohibited.” (<span class='it'>R-145</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1940, Bormann informed Rosenberg that he had
sought to restrict production of religious publications by means
of having their rations of printing paper cut down through the
control exercised by Reichsleiter Amann, but that the result of
these efforts remained unsatisfactory. (<span class='it'>101-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In March 1940, Bormann instructed Reichsleiter Amann, Director
of the NSDAP Publications Office, that in any future redistribution
of paper, confessional writings should receive still sharper

<p class='pindent'>In April 1940, Bormann informed the High Command of the
Navy that use of the term “Divine Service” to refer exclusively
to the services arranged by Christian Confessions was no longer
to be used, even in National Socialist daily papers. In the alternative
he suggested:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

On 28 May 1934, the State Police Office for the District of Duesseldorf
issued an order concerning denominational youth and professional
organizations which stated in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Denominational youth and professional organizations as
well as those created for special occasions only are prohibited
from every public activity outside the church and religious
sphere.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Especially forbidden is: Any public appearance in groups,
all sorts of political activity. Any public sport function including
public hikes and establishment of holiday or outdoor
camps. The public display or showing of flags, banners,
pennants or the open wearing of uniforms or insignia.”
(<span class='it'>R-145</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 20 July 1935, Frick, as Reich and Prussian Minister of
the Interior, issued secret instructions to the provincial governments
and to the Prussian Gestapo that Confessional youth organizations
were to be forbidden to wear uniforms, or uniform-like
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>
clothing, to assemble publicly with pennants and flags, to
wear insignia as a substitute for uniforms, or to engage in any
outdoor sport activity. (<span class='it'>1482-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 20 January 1938 the Gestapo District Office at Munich, issued
a decree which stated in part as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Guild of the Virgin Mary (<span class='it'>die Marianisch Jungfrauenkongregation</span>)
of the Bavarian dioceses, including the diocese

the Societies of Our Lady (<span class='it'>Jungfrauenvereinen</span>) attached to
it, is by police order to be dissolved and forbidden with immediate
effect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the reasons cited for this action were the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The whole behavior of the Guild of the Virgin Mary had
therefore to be objected to from various points of view. It
could be repeatedly observed that the Guild engaged in purely
worldly affairs, such as community games, and then in the
holding of ‘Social Evenings’.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This proves incontestably that the Guild of the Virgin Mary
was active to a very great degree in a manner unecclesiastical
and therefore worldly. By so doing it has left the sphere of
its proper religious task and entered a sphere of activity to
which it has no statutory right. The organization has therefore
to be dissolved and forbidden.” (<span class='it'>1481-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the report of a Security Police “church specialist”
attached to the State Police Office at Aachen, the following

on 22 September 1941:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Retreats, recreational organizations, etc., may now be forbidden
on ground of industrial war-needs, whereas formerly
only a worldly activity could be given as a basis.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Youth camps, recreational camps are to be forbidden on
principle, church organizations in the evening may be prevented
on grounds of the blackout regulations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Processions, pilgrimages abroad are to be forbidden by reason
of the over-burdened transport conditions. For local
events too technical traffic troubles and the danger of air-attack
may serve as grounds for their prohibition. (One Referent
forbade a procession, on the grounds of it wearing out
shoe leather).” (<span class='it'>1815-PS</span>)</p>

who have rescued Germany from disaster. It is therefore
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech at Fulda, 27 November 1937 Reich Minister for
Church Affairs Hans Kerrl stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We cannot recognize that the Church has a right to insure
that the individual should be educated in all respects in the
way in which it holds to be right; but we must leave it to
the National Socialist State to educate the child in the way
it regards as right.” (<span class='it'>2352-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1939, Bormann, acting as Deputy of the Fuehrer,
informed the Minister of Education, that the Party was taking
the position that theological inquiry was not as valuable as the
general fields of knowledge in the universities and that suppression
of Theological Faculties in the universities was to be undertaken
at once. He pointed out that the Concordat with the Vatican
placed certain limitations on such a program, but that in the
light of the general change of circumstances, particularly the
compulsory military service and the execution of the four-year
plan, the question of manpower made certain reorganizations,
economies and simplification necessary. Therefore, Theological
Faculties were to be restricted insofar as they could not be wholly
suppressed. He instructed that the churches were not to be informed
of this development and no public announcement was to
be made. Any complaints, if they were to be replied to at all,
should be answered with a statement that these measures are being
executed in a general plan of reorganization and that similar
things are happening to other faculties. He concludes with the
statement that the professorial chairs vacated by the above program
are to be turned over to the newly-created fields of inquiry,
such as Racial Research. (<span class='it'>116-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A plan for the reduction of Theological Faculties was submitted
by the Reich Minister for Science, Education and Training
in April 1939 to Bormann, who forwarded it to Rosenberg for
consideration and action. The plan called for shifting, combining
and eliminating Theological Faculties in various schools and
universities throughout the Reich, with the following results:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“To recapitulate this plan would include the complete closing
of Theological Faculties at Innsbruck, Salzburg and Munich,
the transfer of the faculty of Graz to Vienna and the
vanishing of four Catholic faculties.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> Closing of three Catholic Theological Faculties or Higher
Schools and of four Evangelic Faculties in the winter semester
1939/40.

<p class='pindent'>In a secret decree of the Party Chancellery, signed by Bormann,
and distributed to all Gauleiters on 7 June 1941, the following
statement concerning religious education was made:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“No human being would know anything of Christianity if it
had not been drilled into him in his childhood by pastors.
The so-called dear God in no wise gives knowledge of his existence
to young people in advance, but in an astonishing
manner in spite of his omnipotence leaves this to the efforts
of the pastors. If therefore in the future our youth learns
nothing more of this Christianity, whose doctrines are far
below ours, Christianity will disappear by itself.” (<span class='it'>D-75</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Supplementary evidence of acts of suppression within Germany.</span>
In laying the groundwork for their attempted subversion
of the Church, the Nazi conspirators resorted to assurances of
peaceful intentions. Thus Hitler, in his address to the Reichstag
on 23 March 1933 declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“While the government is determined to carry through the
political and moral purging of our public life, it is creating
and insuring prerequisites for a truly religious life. The
government sees in both Christian confessions the factors
most important for the maintenance of our Folkdom. It will
respect agreements concluded between them and the states.
However, it expects that its work will meet with a similar
appreciation. The government will treat all other denominations
with equal objective justice. However, it can never
condone that belonging to a certain denomination or to a
certain race might be regarded as a license to commit or
tolerate crimes. The Government will devote its care to the
sincere living together of Church and State.” (<span class='it'>3387-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Against the Evangelical Churches.</span> The Nazi conspirators,
upon their accession to power, passed a number of laws, under
innocent-sounding titles, designed to reduce the Evangelical

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Against the Catholic Church.</span> Just as in their program
against the Evangelical Churches, so in their attack on the Catholic
Church, the Nazi conspirators concealed their real intentions
under a cloak of apparent respect for its rights and protection
of its activities. On 20 July 1933, a Concordat was concluded
between the Holy See and the German Reich, signed for the
Reich by Von Papen (<span class='it'>3280-A-PS</span>). It was the Nazi Government,
not the Church, which initiated the negotiations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Government asked the Holy See to conclude a

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Reich guarantees freedom of profession and

<p class='noindent'>“It acknowledges the right of the Catholic Church, within
the limit of those laws which are applicable to all, to manage

framework of her own competence, to publish laws and
ordinances binding on her members.” (<span class='it'>3280-A-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other articles formulated agreements on basic principles such
as free communication between Rome and the local ecclesiastical
authorities, freedom of the Catholic press, of Catholic education
and of Catholic action in charitable, professional, and youth organizations.
In return, the Vatican pledged loyalty by the clergy
to the Reich Government and emphasis in religious instruction on
the patriotic duties of the Christian citizen. (<span class='it'>3280-A-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reliance upon assurances by the Nazi conspirators, the
Catholic hierarchy had already revoked their previous prohibition
against Catholics becoming members of the Nazi Party
(<span class='it'>3389-PS</span>). The Catholic Center Party, under a combination of
Nazi pressure and assurances, published on 29 December 1933,
an announcement of its dissolution (<span class='it'>2403-PS</span>). Thus the Catholics
went a long way to disarm themselves and cooperate with
the Nazis. Nevertheless, the Nazi conspirators continued to develop
their policy of slow strangulation of religion, first in covert,
and then in open, violation of their assurances and agreements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Encyclical “<span class='it'>Mit Brennender Sorge</span>”, on 14 March 1937,

the enemy in Holy Scripture (Matt. xiii, 25)—sowed
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
the tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny of secret
and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church,
fed from a thousand different sources and making use of
every available means. On them and on them alone and on
their silent and vocal protectors rests the responsibility that
now on the horizon of Germany there is to be seen not the
rainbow of peace but the threatening storm clouds of destructive
religious wars. * * * Anyone who has any
sense of truth left in his mind and even a shadow of the
feeling of justice left in his heart will have to admit that,
in the difficult and eventful years which followed the Concordat,
every word and every action of Ours was ruled by
loyalty to the terms of the agreement; but also he will have
to recognize with surprise and deep disgust that the unwritten
law of the other party has been arbitrary misinterpretation
of agreements, evasion of agreements, evacuation of the
meaning of agreements, and finally more or less open violation

Archbishops, Bishops, and other high administrative dignitaries
be made in the new territories of the Reich, or of certain of them
within the old Reich, without previous consultation with the

things, the changing of the Catholic State elementary schools
into undenominational schools; the permanent or temporary
closing of many minor seminaries, of not a few major seminaries
and of some theological faculties; the suppression of
almost all the private schools and of numerous Catholic
boarding schools and colleges; the repudiation, decided unilaterally,
of financial obligations which the State, Municipalities,

put in the way of the activity of the religious Orders
and Congregations in the spiritual, cultural and social field
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
and above all the suppression of Abbeys, monasteries, convents

is led to infer a deliberate intention of rendering impossible
the very existence of the Orders and Congregations in Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Similar and even graver acts must be deplored in the annexed

prisons, arrested and rearrested, interned in Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen
concentration camp, and the Ettal Monastery, from

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>In Austria.</span> The methods of suppression of churches followed
in Austria by the occupying power began with measures to
exclude the Church from public activities, such as processions,
printing of newspapers and Reviews which could spread Christian
doctrines; from forming Youth organizations, such as Boy
Scouts; from directing educational or charitable activities; and
even from extending help in the form of food to foreigners. Unable
in conscience to obey the public prescription, ministers of
religions were arrested and sent to concentration camps, and
some were executed. Churches were closed, convents and monastries
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
suppressed, and educational property confiscated. The
total number of confiscations, suppressions, or alienations of
religious institutions exceeded 100 cases in one diocese alone.
(<span class='it'>3278-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lutheran Church in Austria, though comprising a small
minority of the population, was subjected to organized oppression.
Its educational efforts were obstructed or banned. Believers
were encouraged, and sometimes intimidated, to repudiate
their faith. Lutheran pastors were given to understand that a
government position would be awarded to each one who would
renounce his ministry and if possible withdraw from the Lutheran
Church. (<span class='it'>3273-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In summation of the period of Nazi domination and in review
of the attempted suppression of the Christian Church, the Archbishops

liberation declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Catholic Church.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * At the outbreak of war, 487 Catholic priests were
among the thousands of Czech patriots arrested and sent to
concentration camps as hostages. Venerable high ecclesiastical
dignitaries were dragged to concentration camps in
Germany. * * * Religious orders were dissolved and
liquidated, their charitable institutions closed down and
their members expelled or else forced to compulsory labor
in Germany. All religious instruction in Czech schools was
suppressed. Most of the weeklies and monthlies which the
Catholics had published in Czechoslovakia, had been suppressed
from the very beginning of the occupation. The
Catholic gymnastic organization “Orel” with 800,000 members
was dissolved and its property was confiscated. To a
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
great extent Catholic church property was seized for the
benefit of the Reich.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Czechoslovak National Church.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The Czechoslovak Church in Slovakia was entirely
prohibited and its property confiscated under German
compulsion in 1940. It has been allowed to exist in Bohemia
and Moravia but in a crippled form under the name of the
Czecho-Moravian Church.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Protestant Churches.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Protestant Churches were deprived of the freedom to
preach the gospel. German secret state police watched
closely whether the clergy observed the restrictions imposed
on it. * * * Some passages from the Bible were not
allowed to be read in public at all. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Church leaders were especially persecuted, scores
of ministers were imprisoned in concentration camps, among
them the General Secretary of the Students’ Christian Movement
in Czechoslovakia. One of the Vice-Presidents was
executed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Protestant Institutions such as the YMCA and YWCA were
suppressed throughout the country.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The leading Theological School for all Evangelical denominations,
HUS Faculty in Prague and all other Protestant
training schools for the ministry were closed down in November
1939, with the other Czech universities and colleges.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>Czech Orthodox Church.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The hardest blow was directed against the Czech Orthodox
Church. The Orthodox churches in Czechoslovakia were
ordered by the Berlin Ministry of Church Affairs to leave
the Pontificat of Belgrade and Constantinople respectively
and to become subordinate to the Berlin Bishop. The Czech
Bishop Gorazd was executed together with two other priests
of the Orthodox Church. By a special order of the Protector
Daluege, issued in September 1942, the Orthodox Church of
Serbian Constantinople jurisdiction was completely dissolved
in the Czech lands, its religious activity forbidden and
its property confiscated.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All Evangelical education was handed over to the civil authorities
and many Evangelical teachers lost their employment;
moreover the State grant to salaries of many Evangelical
priests was taken away.” (<span class='it'>998-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>In Poland.</span> The repressive measures levelled against the
Christian Church in Poland where Hans Frank was Governor-General
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
from 1939 to 1945, were even more drastic and sweeping.
In protest against the systematic strangulation of religion, the
Vatican, on 8 October 1942, addressed a memorandum to the
German Embassy accredited to the Holy See in which the Secretariat
of State emphasized the fact that despite previous protests
to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Reich, von Ribbentrop,
the religious condition of the Catholics in the <span class='it'>Warthegau</span>
“has become even sadder and more tragic.” This memorandum
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For quite a long time the religious situation in the <span class='it'>Warthegau</span>
gives cause for very grave and ever-increasing
anxiety. There, in fact, the Episcopate has been little by
little almost completely eliminated; the secular and regular
clergy have been reduced to proportions that are absolutely
inadequate, because they have been in large part deported
and exiled; the education of clerics has been forbidden; the
Catholic education of youth is meeting with the greatest
opposition; the nuns have been dispersed; insurmountable
obstacles have been put in the way of affording people the
helps of religions; very many churches have been closed;
Catholic intellectual and charitable institutions have been
destroyed; ecclesiastical property has been seized.” (<span class='it'>3263-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 18 November 1942 the Papal Secretary of State requested
the Archbishop of Breslau, Cardinal Bertram, to use every effort
to assist Polish Catholic workers transferred to Germany, who
were being deprived of the consolations of religion. In addition,
he again appealed for help for the Polish priests detained in
various concentration camps, whose death rate was “still on the
increase.” (<span class='it'>3265-PS</span>). On 7 December 1942 the Cardinal Archbishop
of Breslau replied that all possible efforts were being put
forward by the German Bishops without success on behalf of
the victims of concentration camps and labor battalions, and deplored
“the intolerable decrees” against religious ministration to
Poles. (<span class='it'>3266-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 2 March 1943, the Cardinal Secretary of State addressed
a note to von Ribbentrop, Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs, in
which the violations of religious rights and conscience among the
civilian population of Poland were set out in detail, and the time,
locality, and character of the persecutions were specified. Priests
and Ecclesiastics were still being arrested, thrust into concentration
camps, and treated with scorn and derision, while many
had been summarily executed. Religious instruction was hampered;
Catholic schools were closed; the use of the Polish language
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
in sacred functions and even in the Sacrament of Penance
was forbidden. Even the natural right of marriage was denied
to men of Polish nationality under 28 years of age to women
under 25. In the territory called “General Government” similar
conditions existed and against these the Holy See vigorously protested.
To save the harassed and persecuted leaders of the
Catholic Church, the Vatican had petitioned that they be allowed
to emigrate to neutral countries of Europe or America. The only
concession made was that they would all be collected in one concentration
camp—Dachau. (<span class='it'>3264-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators adopted a dilatory and obstructionist
policy toward complaints as to religious affairs in the overrun
territories, and a decision was “taken by those competent to do
so. * * * that no further consideration will be taken of proposals
or requests concerning the territories which do not belong
to the Old Reich.” (<span class='it'>3262-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those competent” to make decisions on complaints as to religious
affairs in the overrun territories—especially the Party
Chancery, headed by Bormann—the methods they used, and the
reasons for their attitude are outlined by the Cardinal Archbishop
of Breslau, a German living in Germany, in a letter to
the Papal Secretary of State on 7 December 1942 as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Your Eminence knows very well the greatest difficulty in
the way of opening negotiations comes from the overruling
authority which the “National Socialist Party Chancery”
(<span class='it'>Kanzlei der National-Sozialistischen Partei</span>, known as the
<span class='it'>Partei-Kanzlei</span>) exercises in relation to the Chancery of the
Reich (<span class='it'>Reichskanzlei</span>) and to the single Reich Ministries.
This ‘<span class='it'>Parteikanzlei</span>’ directs the course to be followed by the
State, whereas the Ministries and the Chancery of the Reich
are obliged and compelled to adjust their decrees to these
directions. Besides, there is the fact that the “Supreme Office
for the Security of the Reich” called the ‘<span class='it'>Reichssicherheitshauptamt</span>’
enjoys an authority which precludes all legal action
and all appeals. Under it are the ‘Secret Offices for
Public Security’ called ‘<span class='it'>Geheime Staatspolizei</span>’ (a title shortened
usually to <span class='it'>Gestapo</span>) of which there is one for each Province.
Against the decrees of this Central Office (<span class='it'>Reichssicherheitshauptamt</span>)
and of the Secret Offices (<span class='it'>Geheime Staatspolizei</span>)
there is no appeal through the Courts, and no complaint
made to the Ministries has any effect. Not infrequently
the Councillors of the Ministries suggest that they
have not been able to do as they would wish to, because of
the opposition of these Party offices. As far as the executive
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
power is concerned, the organization called the SS, that is
<span class='it'>Schutzstaffeln der Partei</span>, is in practice supreme.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This hastily sketched interrelation of authorities is the
reason why many of the petitions and protests made by the
Bishops to the Ministries have been foiled. Even if we
present our complaints to the so-called Supreme Security
Office, there is rarely any reply; and when there is, it is
negative.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On a number of very grave and fundamental issues we
have also presented our complaints to the Supreme Leader of
the Reich (<span class='it'>Fuehrer</span>). Either no answer is given, or it is
apparently edited by the above-mentioned Party Chancery,
which does not consider itself bound by the Concordat made
with the Holy See.” (<span class='it'>3266-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The interchange of correspondence following the transmission of
the above-described note of 2 March 1943 on the religious situation
in the overrun Polish Provinces illustrates the same
evasive tactics. (<span class='it'>3269-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his Allocution to the Sacred College, on 2 June 1945, His
Holiness Pope Pius XII recalled, by way of example, “some details
from the abundant accounts which have reached us from
priests and laymen who were interned in the concentration camp
at Dachau”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the forefront, for the number and harshness of the treatment
meted out to them, are the Polish priests. From 1940
to 1945, 2,800 Polish ecclesiastics and religious were imprisoned
in that camp; among them was the Auxiliary bishop of
Wloclawek, who died there of typhus. In April last there
were left only 816, all the others being dead except for two
or three transferred to another camp. In the summer of
1942, 480 German-speaking ministers of religion were
known to be gathered there; of these, 45 were Protestants,
all the others Catholic priests. In spite of the continuous
inflow of new internees, especially from some dioceses of
Bavaria, Rhenania and Westphalia, their number, as a result
of the high rate of mortality, at the beginning of this year,
did not surpass 350. Nor should we pass over in silence
those belonging to occupied territories, Holland, Belgium,
France (among whom the Bishop of Clermont), Luxembourg,
Slovenia, Italy. Many Of those priests and laymen
endured indescribable sufferings for their faith and for their
vocation. In one case the hatred of the impious against
Christ reached the point of parodying on the person of an
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>
interned priest, with barbed wire, the scourging and the
crowning with thorns of our Redeemer.” (<span class='it'>3268-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Further revealing figures on the persecution of Polish priests
are contained in the following extract from Charge No. 17
against Hans Frank, Governor-General of Poland, submitted by
the Polish Government, entitled “Maltreatment and Persecution
of the Catholic Clergy in the Western Provinces”:</p>

<p class='hang'>“IV. <span class='it'>GENERAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF THE
PERSECUTION</span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'>11. The general situation of the clergy in the Archdiocese
of Poznan in the beginning of April 1940 is summarized
in the following words of Cardinal Hlond’s
second report:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>‘5</span><p class='listPara'>priests shot</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='hang'>12. In the diocese of Chelmno, where about 650 priests
were installed before the war only 3% were allowed
to stay, the 97% of them were imprisoned, executed
or put into concentration camps.</p>

<p class='hang'>13. By January 1941 about 7000 priests were killed, 3000
were in prison or concentration camps.” (<span class='it'>3279-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Allocution of Pope Pius XII on 2 June 1945 described
National Socialism as “the arrogant apostasy from Jesus Christ,
the denial of His doctrine and of His work of redemption, the
cult of violence, the idolatry of race and blood, the overthrow of
human liberty and dignity.” It summarized the attacks of “National
Socialism” on the Catholic Church in these terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The struggle against the Church did, in fact, become even
more bitter: there was the dissolution of Catholic organizations;
the gradual suppression of the flourishing Catholic
schools, both public and private; the enforced weaning of
youth from family and Church; the pressure brought to bear
on the conscience of citizens, and especially of civil servants;
the systematic defamation, by means of a clever, closely-organized
propaganda, of the Church, the clergy, the faithful,
the Church’s institutions, teaching and history; the
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
closing, dissolution, confiscation of religious houses and
other ecclesiastical institutions; the complete suppression of
the Catholic press and publishing houses.” (<span class='it'>3268-PS</span>)</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'>Point 4: “None but members of the nation (<span class='it'>Volksgenosse</span>)
may be citizens. None but those of German blood, whatever
their creed, may be members of the nation. No Jew,
therefore, may be a member of the nation.”</p>

<p class='hang'>Point 5: “Anyone who is not a citizen may live in Germany
only as a guest and must be regarded as being subject to
legislation for foreigners.”</p>

<p class='hang'>Point 6: “The right to determine matters concerning government
and legislation is to be enjoyed by the citizen
alone. We demand therefore that all appointments to public
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>
office, of whatever kind, whether in the Reich, Land, or

<p class='hang'>Point 7: “We demand that the state make it its first duty to
promote the industry and livelihood of citizens. If it is
not possible to nourish the entire population of the State,
the members of foreign nations (non-citizens) are to be
expelled from the Reich.”</p>

<p class='hang'>Point 8: “Any further immigration of non-Germans is to
be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans who entered
Germany subsequent to 2 August 1914, shall be
forced immediately to leave the Reich.”</p>

<p class='hang'>Point 23: “We demand legal warfare against conscious political
lies and their dissemination through the press. In

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Development of ideological basis for anti-Semitic measures.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the innumerable statements made by the leaders of the
NSDAP are the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg advocated in 1920 the adoption of the following
program concerning the Jews:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“(1)</span><p class='listPara'>The Jews are to be recognized as a (separate) nation

their contribution of work may be considered.
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span></p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>(5)</span><p class='listPara'>Jews have no right to be leaders of cultural institutions
of the state and community (theaters, galleries, etc.)
or to be professors and teachers in German schools
and universities.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>(6)</span><p class='listPara'>Jews have no right to be active in state or municipal
commissions for examinations, control, censorship, etc.
Jews have no right to represent the German Reich in

in the directorate of state banks or communal credit
establishments.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>(7)</span><p class='listPara'>Foreign Jews have no right to settle in Germany permanently.
Their admission into the German political
community is to be forbidden under all circumstances.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>(8)</span><p class='listPara'>Zionism should be energetically supported in order to
promote the departure of German Jews—in numbers
to be determined annually—to Palestine or generally
across the border.” (<span class='it'>2842-PS</span>)</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg’s “Zionism” was neither sincere nor consistent, for
in 1921 he advocated breaking up Zionism, “which is involved in
English-Jewish politics.” (<span class='it'>2432-PS</span>). He advocated in 1921 the
adoption by “all Germans” of the following slogans: “Get the
Jews out of all parties. Institute measures for the repudiation of
all citizenship rights of all Jews and half-Jews: banish all the
Eastern Jews; exercise strictest vigilance over the native ones.
* * *” (<span class='it'>2432-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick and other Nazis introduced a motion in the Reichstag on
27 May 1924, “to place all members of the Jewish race under
special laws.” (<span class='it'>2840-PS</span>). Frick also asked in the Reichstag, on
25 August 1924, for the realization of the Nazi program by “exclusion
of all Jews from public office.” (<span class='it'>2893-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Anti-Semitism was seized upon by the Nazi conspirators as
a convenient instrument to unite groups and classes of divergent
views and interests under one banner.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolf Hitler described racial anti-Semitism as “a new creed
for the masses” and its spreading among the German people as
“the most formidable task to be accomplished by our movement.”
(<span class='it'>2881-PS</span>). Rosenberg called for the “<span class='it'>Zusammenraffen aller
Deutschen zu einer stahlharten, voelkischen Einheitsfront</span>” (gathering
of all Germans into a steel-hard racial united front) on
the basis of anti-Semitic slogans (<span class='it'>2432-PS</span>). Gotfried Feder,
official commentator of the Nazi Party program, stated: “Anti-Semitism
is in a way the emotional foundation of our movement.”
(<span class='it'>2844-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There are innumerable admissions on the part of the Nazi
leaders as to the part which their anti-Semitic propaganda played
in their acquisition of control. The following statement concerning
the purpose of racial propaganda was made by Dr. Walter
Gross, director of the Office of Racial Policy of the Nazi Party:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the years of fight, the aim was to employ all means of
propaganda which promised success in order to gather people
who were ready to overthrow, together with the Party,
the harmful post-war regime and put the power into the
hand of the Fuehrer and his collaborators. * * * In
these years of fight the aim was purely political: I meant
the overthrow of the regime and acquisition of power.
* * * Within this great general task the education in
racial thinking necessarily played a decisive part, because
herein lies basically the deepest revolutionary nature of the
new spirit.” (<span class='it'>2845-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In another official Nazi publication, recommended for circulation
in all Party units and establishments, it is stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The whole treatment of the Jewish problem in the years
prior to our seizure of power is to be regarded essentially
from the point of view of the political education of the German
people.” (To disregard this angle of the use made of
anti-Semitism means) “to disregard the success and aim of
the work toward racial education.” (<span class='it'>2427-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>After the acquisition of power the Nazi conspirators initiated
a state policy of persecution of the Jews.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The first organized act was the boycott of Jewish enterprises
on 1 April 1933.</span> The boycott action was approved by all
the defendants who were members of the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> (Reich
Cabinet), and Streicher was charged with its execution. Presented
as an alleged act of “self defense”, the boycott action was
intended to frighten Jewish public opinion abroad and force it,
by the threat of collective responsibility to all Jews in Germany,
to desist from warning against the Nazi danger. (<span class='it'>2409-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2410-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boycott was devised as a demonstration of the extent to
which the Nazi Party controlled its members and the German
masses; consequently, spontaneous action and physical violence
were discouraged. Goebbels stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The national socialist leadership had declared: ‘The boycott
is legal’, and the government demands that the people permit
that the boycott be carried out legally. We expect iron
discipline. This must be for the whole world a wonderful
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
show of unity and manly training. To those abroad who
believe that we could not manage it, we want to show that
we have the people in our hand.” (<span class='it'>2431-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Laws eliminating Jews from various offices and functions.</span>
The Nazi conspirators legislative program was gradual and,
in the beginning, relatively “moderate.” In the first period,
which dates from 7 April 1933 until September 1935, the laws
eliminated Jews from public office and limited their participation
in schools, certain professions, and cultural establishments. The
following are the major laws issued in this period:</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 10 September 1935, Minister of Education Rust issued a
circular ordering the complete elimination of Jewish pupils from
“Aryan” schools (<span class='it'>2894-PS</span>). This legislative activity, in addition
to being the first step towards the elimination of the Jews,
served an “educational” purpose and was a further test of the
extent of control exerted by the Nazi Party and regime over the
German masses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Achim Gercke, racial expert of the Ministry of the Interior,
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The laws are mainly educational and give direction. The
aspect of the laws should not be underestimated. The entire
nation is enlightened on the Jewish problem; it learns to
understand that the national community is a blood community;
it understands for the first time the racial idea, and
is diverted from a too theoretical treatment of the Jewish
problem and faced with the actual solution.” (<span class='it'>2904-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was clear, however, that the Nazi conspirators had a far
more ambitious program in the Jewish problem and put off its
realization for reasons of expediency. In the words of Dr. Gercke:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Nevertheless the laws published thus far cannot bring a
final solution of the Jewish problem, because the time has
not yet come for it, although the decrees give the general
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
direction and leave open the possibility of further developments.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It would be in every respect premature now to work out
and publicly discuss plans to achieve more than can be
achieved for the time being. However, one must point out a
few basic principles so that the ideas which one desires and
must have ripened will contain no mistakes. * * *</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All suggestions aiming at a permanent situation, at a stabilization
of, the status of the Jews in Germany do not solve
the Jewish problem, because they do not detach the Jews
from Germany. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Plans and programs must contain an aim pointing to the

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Deprivation of Jews of their rights as citizens.</span> After a
propaganda barrage, in which the speeches and writings of
Streicher were most prominent, the Nazi conspirators initiated
the second period of anti-Jewish legislation (15 September 1935
to September 1938). In this period the Jews were deprived of
their full rights as citizens (First Nurnberg Law) and forbidden
to marry “Aryans” (Second Nurnberg Law). Further steps were
taken to eliminate Jews from certain professions, and the groundwork
was laid for the subsequent expropriation of Jewish property.
These laws were hailed as the fulfillment of the Nazi Party
program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Program of 9 November 1938 and elimination of Jews
from economic life.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the autumn of 1938, within the framework of economic
preparation for aggressive war and as an act of defiance to
world opinion, the Nazi conspirators began to put into effect a
program of complete elimination of the Jews. The measures
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
taken were partly presented as retaliation against “world Jewry”
in connection with the killing of a German embassy official in
Paris. Unlike the boycott action in April, 1933, when care was
taken to avoid violence, an allegedly “spontaneous” pogrom was
staged and carried out all over Germany on orders of Heydrich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The organized character of the pogrom is also obvious from
the admission of Heydrich and others at a meeting presided over
by Goering at the Air Ministry in Berlin. (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The legislative measures which followed were discussed and
approved in their final form at a meeting on 12 November 1938
under the chairmanship of Goering, with the participation of
Frick, Funk and others. The meeting was called following Hitler’s
orders “requesting that the Jewish questions be now, once and
for all, coordinated and solved one way or another.” The participants
agreed on measures to be taken “for the elimination of
the Jew from German economy.” Other possibilities, such as the
establishment of ghettos, stigmatization through special insignia,
and “the main problem, namely to kick the Jew out of Germany”,
were also discussed. All these measures were later enacted as
soon as conditions permitted. (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The laws issued in this period were signed mostly by Goering,
in his capacity as Deputy for the Four Year Plan, and were thus
connected with the consolidation of control over German economy
in preparation for aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Extermination of German Jews.</span> Early in 1939 Hitler and
the other Nazi conspirators decided to arrive at a “final solution
of the Jewish problem.” In connection with preparations for
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
aggressive war, further consolidation of controls and removal of
elements not belonging to the <span class='it'>Volksgemeinschaft</span> (racial community)
were deemed necessary. The conspirators also anticipated
the conquest of territories in Eastern Europe inhabitated
by large numbers of Jews and the impossibility of forcing large-scale
emigration in wartime. Hence, other and more drastic
measures became necessary. The emphasis in this period shifted
from legislative acts to police measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 24 January 1939 Heydrich was charged with the mission of
“arriving at a solution of the Jewish problem.” (<span class='it'>710-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 15 January 1939 Rosenberg stated in a speech at Detmold:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For Germany the Jewish problem will be solved only when
the last Jew has left Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On 7 February 1939, Rosenberg appealed to foreign nations to
forget “ideological differences” and unite against the “real
enemy,” the Jew. He advocated the creation of a “reservation”
where the Jews of all countries should be concentrated (<span class='it'>2843-PS</span>).
In his Reichstag speech on 30 January 1939, Hitler made
the following prophecy:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The result [of war] will be * * * the annihilation of
the Jewish race in Europe.” (<span class='it'>2663-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the direction was given for a policy which was carried
out as soon as the conquest of foreign territories created the
material conditions. (For the carrying out and results of the
program of the Nazi conspirators against Jewry, see Chapter
XII.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the final period of the anti-Jewish crusade very few legislative
measures were passed. The Jews were delivered to the SS
and various extermination staffs. The last law dealing with the
Jews in Germany, signed by Frick, Bormann, Schwerin V. Krosigk,
and Thierach, put them entirely outside the law and ordered
the confiscation by the State of the property of dead Jews (<span class='it'>1422-PS</span>).
This law was a weak reflection of a factual situation already
in existence. Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart, assistant to Frick, stated at
that time:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The aim of the racial legislation may be regarded as already
achieved and consequently the racial legislation as
essentially closed. It led to the temporary solution of the
Jewish problem and at the same time prepared the final
solution. Many regulations will lose their practical importance
as Germany approaches the achievement of the
final goal in the Jewish problem.” (<span class='it'>Stuckart and Schiedermair:
Rassen und Erbpflege in der Gesetzgebung des Reiches</span>
(The care for Race and Heredity in the Legislation of the
Reich), Leipzig, 1943, p. 14.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators reshaped the educational system.</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators publicly announced the purposes of
their educational and training program.</span> Hitler stated at Elbing,
Germany:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When an opponent declares, ‘I will not come over to your
side, and you will not get me on your side,’ I calmly say,
‘Your child belongs to me already. A people lives forever.
What are you? You will pass on. Your descendants however
now stand in the new camp. <span class='it'>In a short time they will
know nothing else but this new community.’</span>” (<span class='it'>2455-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler said on 1 May 1937:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The youth of today is ever the people of tomorrow. For
this reason we have set before ourselves the task of inoculating
our youth with the spirit of this community of the
people at a very early age, at an age when human beings are
still unperverted and therefore unspoiled. * * * This Reich
stands, and it is building itself up for the future, upon its
youth. And this new Reich will give its youth to no one,
<span class='it'>but will itself take youth and give to youth its own education
and its own upbringing</span>.” (<span class='it'>2454-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The first sentence in the official instructors manual for high
schools reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German school is a part of the National Socialist Educational
order. It is its obligation to form the national socialistic
personality in cooperation with the other educational
powers of the nation, but by its distinctive educational
means.” (<span class='it'>2453-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler stated in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On this basis the whole education by the National State
must aim primarily not at the stuffing with mere knowledge,
but at the building up of bodies which are physically
healthy to the core. The development of intellectual faculties
comes only after this.” (<span class='it'>2392-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>They transferred responsibility for education from the
states to the Reich.</span> The Reich Ministry of Education was established,
and control of all schools, public and private, including
universities and adult educational activities, was transferred to
this Reichsministry (<span class='it'>2078-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2088-PS</span>). The control of education
by the local authorities was replaced by the absolute authority
of the Reich in all educational matters. (<span class='it'>2393-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>They changed the curricula and textbooks.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Kindergarten</span>: Children from two to six years were trained
in more than 15,000 Kindergartens operated by the Party and
State. The teachers in charge were trained in special schools
that emphasized the ideological views of the Nazi Party. The
children were given a systematic training in Nazi ideology.
(<span class='it'>2443-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2441-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Elementary schools</span>: Primary emphasis was placed on physical
training. History, German race culture and mathematics
were the other subjects emphasized. These subjects were taught
in such a way as to emphasize the cultural superiority of the German
people, the importance of race, the Fuehrer principle, glorification
of German war heroes, the subversive elements that
caused the defeat of Germany in World War I, the shame of the
Versailles Treaty, and the rebirth of Germany under the Nazis.
(<span class='it'>2392-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2397-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2441-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2394-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to education in the schools all children from six
to ten years were registered in the <span class='it'>Kindergruppen</span> (Children’s
Groups) conducted by the National Socialist <span class='it'>Frauenschaft</span> (National
Socialist Women’s Organization). All children were required
to obtain an efficiency record card and uniform and were
instructed in Nazi ideology by the members of the Women’s Organization.
(<span class='it'>2441-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2452-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>High Schools</span> (Hoeheren Schule): The curricula and organization
of the <span class='it'>Hoeheren</span> School was modified by a series of decrees
of the Minister of Education in order to make these schools effective
instruments for the teaching of the Nazi doctrines. A
new curricula emphasizing physical training, German war history,
and race culture was introduced. (<span class='it'>2453-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Universities</span>: The schools of politics and physical education
became the largest colleges at the universities. Beginning in
1933 the Nazis introduced courses in heredity and race culture,
ancient and modern German history, biology and geopolitics.
(<span class='it'>2443-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2441-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Textbooks in the schools were changed to accord with the expressed
objectives of the Nazi conspirators. (<span class='it'>2446-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2442-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2444-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2445-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators acquired domination and control
over all teachers.</span> The law for the reestablishing of the professional
civil service made it possible for the Nazi conspirators
thoroughly to reexamine all German teachers and to remove all
“harmful and untrustworthy” elements (<span class='it'>1397-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2392-PS</span>).
Many teachers and professors (mostly Jewish) were dismissed
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>
and were replaced with “State spirited” teachers (<span class='it'>2392-PS</span>).
All teachers were required to take an oath of loyalty and obedience
to Hitler. (<span class='it'>2061-PS</span>). All teachers were required to
belong to the National Socialist <span class='it'>Lehrerbund</span> (National Socialist
Teachers League), which organization was charged with the
training of all teachers in the theories and doctrines of the
NSDAP. (<span class='it'>2452-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1934 the National Socialist Teachers League was declared
to be the official organ of German education. (<span class='it'>2393-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Civil Service Act of 1937 required the teachers to be “the
executors of the will of the party-supported State.” It required
them to be ready at “any time to defend without reservation the
National Socialist State.” The law required the teachers to participate
strenuously in elections, have thorough knowledge of Party
principles and literature, render the Hitler Salute, send their
children to the Hitler Youth, and educate them in the Nazi spirit
(<span class='it'>2340-PS</span>). Before taking their second examination (required
for permanent appointment), teachers in Prussia were required
to show service in the SA and in the <span class='it'>Arbeitsdienst</span> (Labor Service)
(<span class='it'>2392-PS</span>). Candidates for teaching and other public positions
were required to have “proved themselves” in the Hitler
Jugend (<span class='it'>2451-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2900-PS</span>). Teachers’ academies were judged
by the Minister of Education on their ability to turn out men
and women with new ideas “based on blood and soil”. (<span class='it'>2394-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leadership principle replaced the democratic school principle.
A decree of the Reich Minister of Education made the head of
any school fully responsible for the conduct of the institution in
line with the official party ideology. Teachers committees and
Student Committees were abolished (<span class='it'>2393-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2392-PS</span>). A
“confidential instructor,” the school youth warden of the Hitler
Jugend, appointed by the Hitler Youth authorities, was assigned
to each school (<span class='it'>2396-PS</span>). The “Parents Advisory Committees”
in the public schools were dissolved, and replaced by the “School
Communities,” (<span class='it'>Schulgemeinde</span>). The headmaster was the leader.
He appointed, after consultation with the local party leader, two
to five teachers or parents, known as “<span class='it'>Jugendwalter</span>,” (Youth
Advisors) and one Hitler Youth leader, who was appointed after
consultation with the Hitler Youth officials in the district
(<span class='it'>2399-PS</span>). The duties of the “School Community” were to bring
to the attention of the public the educational objectives of the
Nazi Party, including race questions, heredity indoctrination,
physical training, and the Youth League activities. The function
of advising the school authorities, formerly performed by the
“Parents Advisory Committees,” was eliminated by the decree.

<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Universities</span>: The Leadership Principle was introduced into the
universities. The <span class='it'>Rektor</span> (head of the university) was appointed
by the Reich Minister of Education for an unspecified period of
time and was responsible only to the Reichs Minister. The University
was divided into the <span class='it'>Dozentenschaft</span> (Lecturers Corps)
and the <span class='it'>Studentenschaft</span> (Student Corps). The leaders of these
two bodies were also appointed by the Reichsminister of Education
(<span class='it'>2394-PS</span>). The teaching staff of the university was subject
to the control of the National Socialist <span class='it'>Dozentenbund</span>
(NSDoB) (Nazi Association of University Lecturers). The purposes
of the NSDoB were:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) to take a decisive part in the selection of lecturers and to
produce candidates for the teaching staff who were wholly Nazi
in their outlook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) to train all university lecturers in Nazi ideology,</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) to see that the entire university life was run in accordance
with the philosophy of the Party. (<span class='it'>2452-PS</span>; <span class='it'>318-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>All German students at the universities were required to belong
to the <span class='it'>Studentenschaft</span> (Student Corps) (<span class='it'>2084-PS</span>). The
Student Corps was responsible for making the students conscious
of their duties to the Nazis, and was obliged to promote enrollment
in the SA and labor service. Physical training of students
was the responsibility of the SA. Political education was the
responsibility of the <span class='it'>National-Sozialistische Deutsche Studentenbund</span>
(NSDStB), (National Socialist German Student Bund)
(<span class='it'>2458-PS</span>). The National Socialist Student Bund (NSDStB)
was the Nazi “elite” of the student body and was responsible for
the leadership of the university students, and all leaders of the
Student Corps were appointed from its membership. The Nazi
Student Bund was solely responsible for the entire ideological
and political education of the students. (<span class='it'>2395-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2399-PS</span>;

training the youth through the Hitler Jugend.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators from their early days expressed
their belief in the fundamental importance of controlling the education
and training of youth.</span> Hitler stated in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is precisely our German people, that today broken down,
lies defenseless against the kicks of the rest of the world
who need that suggestive force that lies in self-confidence.
But this <span class='it'>self-confidence has to be instilled</span> into the young
fellow-citizen from childhood on. His entire education and
development has to be directed at giving him <span class='it'>the conviction</span>
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
<span class='it'>of being absolutely superior to others</span>. With this physical
force and skill he has again to win the belief in the invincibility
of his entire nationality. For what once led the German
army to victory was the sum of the confidence which
the individual and all in common had in their leaders. The
confidence in <span class='it'>the possibility of regaining its freedom</span> is what
will restore the German people. But this conviction must
be the final product of the same feeling of millions of individuals.”
(<span class='it'>404-PS</span>; see also <span class='it'>2901-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The racial State will have to see to it that there will be a
generation which by a suitable education will be ready for
the final and ultimate decision on this globe. The nation
which enters first on this course will be the victorious one.”
(<span class='it'>404-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The law of the Hitler Youth provides in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The future of the German nation depends on its youth, and
the German youth shall have to be prepared for its future
duties. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The German youth besides being reared within the family
and school, shall be educated physically, intellectually and
morally in the spirit of National Socialism to serve the people
and community, through the Hitler Youth.” (<span class='it'>1392-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On May 1, 1938 Hitler said in a speech to the youth:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Since the victory of the Movement, under whose banner you
stand, there has been completed within our people the unification
of heart (innere Einigung) of the Germans. And
as wages for this work of ours Providence has given us
Greater Germany (Grossdeutschland). <span class='it'>This unification is
no gift of chance, it is the result of a systematic education
of our people by the National Socialist Movement.</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
this education begins with the individual at an age when he
is not already burdened with preconceived ideas. The youth
is the stone which is to go to the building of our new Reich!
You are Greater Germany! In you is being formed the community
of the German people. Before the single leader there
stands a Reich, before the single Reich stands a people, and
before the single people stands German youth! When I see
you my faith in the future of Germany has no bounds,
nothing can shake it. For I know that you will fulfill all
that we hope of you. So I greet you today on this 1st of May
in our new great Germany: for you are our spring. In you
will and shall be completed that for which generations and
centuries have striven, Germany!” (<span class='it'>2454-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators destroyed or took over all other
youth organizations.</span> The first Nazi youth League (<span class='it'>Nationalsocialistischen
Jugendbund</span>) was organized in 1922. In 1925 the
Hitler Youth was officially recognized by the Nazi Party and became
a Junior Branch of the SA. In 1931 Baldur von Schirach
was appointed Reichs Youth Leader of the NSDAP with the rank
of SA <span class='it'>Gruppenfuehrer</span>. (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Nazi conspirators came to power the Hitler Jugend
was a minor organization among many youth associations in Germany.
At the end of 1932 it had only 107,956 members—less
than 5 percent of the total youth population of Germany
(<span class='it'>2435-PS</span>). Schirach was appointed “<span class='it'>Jugendfuehrer des Deutschen
Reichs</span>” (Youth Leader of the German Reich), in June 1933.
In this position he was directly responsible to Hitler for the education
and training of the German youth outside of the home and
school in accordance with the ideology of the Nazi Party.
(<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In June of 1933 on orders of Schirach, an armed band of Hitler
youths occupied by force the headquarters of the Reich Committee
of The German Youth Associations and took over all files and
personnel records of the youth leagues represented by the Committee.
By the same method the offices and property (including all
youth hostels in Germany) of the Reich Association for German
Youth Hostels was seized, and a Nazi representative of Schirach
put in charge (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>). By decree dated 22 June 1933
Schirach dissolved the Grossdeutsches Bund and all of its affiliated
organizations and took over their property; he dissolved The Reich
Committee of The German Youth Associations, and required all
other youth organizations to make a complete report of all organizational
information, including names of all officers and members
and inventory of all funds and property (<span class='it'>2229-PS</span>). The
Youth Associations of all political parties and of all labor organizations
were dissolved by decree of Schirach. By virtue of these
decrees all youth organizations except those sponsored by the
Catholic and Protestant Churches were abolished or incorporated
in the Hitler Jugend (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2260-PS</span>). The Nazi-appointed
Reichsbishop Mueller entered into an agreement with Schirach
which transferred all members of the Evangelical Youth to the
Hitler Jugend and provided that the Hitler Jugend alone would
provide the state political and physical education of the Protestant
youth. By the end of 1933 only the Catholic Youth organization
remained untouched. (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Concordat entered into with the Holy See on July 20, 1933
provided for the continuance of the Catholic Youth Association
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
(<span class='it'>2655-PS</span>). Contrary to the provisions of the Concordat, the
Nazi conspirators immediately set out to smash the Catholic
Youth organization and to force all young people into the Hitler
Youth. Ten days after the signing of the Concordat, Schirach
issued an order forbidding simultaneous membership in the Hitler
Jugend and the Catholic Youth League (<span class='it'>2456-PS</span>). In 1934
Schirach wrote, “The denominational youth league (Catholic
Youth Association) has no right to exist in our time.” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>).
A year later Catholic youth associations were forbidden to wear
uniforms, to assemble publicly, to wear insignia, or to engage in
outdoor sport activity (<span class='it'>1482-PS</span>). Additional pressure was exerted
on the Catholic Youth by the requirement of membership
in the Hitler Youth as a prerequisite of public employment
(<span class='it'>2451-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2900-PS</span>). Finally, in 1937, Schirach announced:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>The struggle for the unification of the German Youth is
finished.</span> I considered it as my duty to conduct it in a hard
and uncompromising manner. Many might not have realized
why we went through so much trouble for the sake of the
youth. And yet the National Socialist German Workers
Party, whose trustee I felt I always was and always will be,
this party considered <span class='it'>the struggle for the youth as the decisive
element</span> for the future of the German nation.”
(<span class='it'>2306-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators made membership in the Hitler
Jugend compulsory.</span> The Hitler Youth Law of 1936 provided that
“All of the German Youth in the Reich is organized within the
Hitler Youth.” (<span class='it'>1392-PS</span>). Executive decrees later implemented
this law by the establishment of severe penalties against anyone
who deterred a youth from service in the Hitler Jugend, and confirmed
the policy of excluding Jews from membership.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hitler Jugend had been from its inception a formation of
the Nazi Party. By virtue of the 1936 Youth Law it became an
agency of the Reich Government while still retaining its position
as a formation of the Nazi Party. (<span class='it'>1392-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hitler Jugend indoctrinated the youth with the idea that
war is a noble activity. (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2436-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hitler Jugend, in accordance with the policy of the Nazi

<p class='pindent'>The Hitler Jugend taught that the guiding principle of German
policy was the utilization of the space to the East (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2439-PS</span>). All activities carried on in support of the demands
for modification of the Versailles Treaty, the restoration of colonies,

coordinated with the (VDA) <span class='it'>Verein fuer das Deutschtum in

<p class='pindent'>In order to carry out the program of indoctrination of the
youth, more than 765,000 were actively engaged as Hitler Youth
leaders by May 1939. Youth leaders were thoroughly trained,
many of them in special “Youth Leaders” schools (<span class='it'>2435-PS</span>).
More than 200,000 political indoctrination meetings (<span class='it'>Heimabend</span>)
were held weekly. Each community was required by law
to provide a suitable meeting house for the Hitler Jugend. Training
and propaganda films were produced on an elaborate scale.
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
In the winter of 1937-38 more than three million youths attended
showings of these films. The Hitler Jugend press and propaganda

other publications and yearbooks appealing to all age groups and
to the various interest groups of the youth. (<span class='it'>2435-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most important functions of the Hitler Jugend was
to prepare the youth for membership in the Party and its formations.

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“He alone, who owns the youth, gains the Future! Practical
consequences of this doctrine: The boy will enter the <span class='it'>Jungvolk</span>

will come to the Hitler Youth, and the boy of the Hitler
Youth will join the SA, the SS and the other formations, and
the SA man and the SS man will one day join the Labor
Service, and from there he will go to the Armed Forces, and

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Streifendienst</span>, a special formation of the Hitler Jugend,

Schirach for the purpose of securing and training recruits for the
SS, with special emphasis on securing recruits for the Deaths
Head Troops of the SS (concentration camp guards). (<span class='it'>2396-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farm service section of the Hitler Jugend also became a
cadet corps of the SS by reason of the agreement entered into
between Himmler and Schirach in 1938. This formation was to
train for SS membership youths especially suited to become
<span class='it'>Wehrbauer</span> (militant peasants), who were to be settled in places
where the Nazis needed especially trained farmers. (<span class='it'>2567-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1937 the Adolf Hitler Schools were established in order to
indoctrinate boys selected by the Party to be the future leaders
of the Nazi state. The schools were operated by the Hitler Jugend
for the Party. Boys entered at the age of 12 and remained
in the school until 18 years of age. (<span class='it'>2653-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators used the Hitler Jugend for extensive

<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to general military training, specialized training

Hitler Youth 60,000 boys. As part of the campaign for the
encouragement of aviation 55,000 members of the Jungvolk
were trained in gliding for group activities; 74,000 boys of
the Hitler Youth are organized in its flying units; 15,000
boys passed their gliding test in the year 1937 alone.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Today 1,200,000 boys of the Hitler Youth receive regular
instructions in small-bore rifle shooting from 7,000 instructors.”
(<span class='it'>2454-PS</span>; see also <span class='it'>2441-PS</span>.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A formal agreement between the Wehrmacht and the Hitler
Jugend was published 11 August 1939. It recites that whereas
30,000 Hitler Jugend leaders had been trained annually in shooting
and field exercises, the number would be doubled; that 60,000,000
shots had been fired in Hitler Youth training courses in
1938 and that a considerable increase in the figure was expected.
The agreement recognized the close cooperation that existed between
the Hitler Jugend and the Wehrmacht in the military
training of youth and provided for a far more extensive program.

<span class='it'>Gau-</span>, <span class='it'>Kreis-</span>, and <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenpropagandaaemter</span> (<span class='it'>Gau</span>, district,
and local propaganda offices). The <span class='it'>Gaupropagandaleiter</span> (leader

of the Chamber of Culture (<span class='it'>Landeskulturwalter</span>) and
in most cases also represented the regional office of the Propaganda
Ministry, so that on the lower levels, Party and State propaganda
were completely unified. (<span class='it'>2315-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The office of Reichspressechef</span> (Reich Press Chief).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The office of Reich Press Chief of the NSDAP was created in
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>
1934 by decree of the Fuehrer (<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>). The functions of this
office were exclusive:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Press Office of the NSDAP is the central office
for the entire political publishing activity of the Party. It
represents the press interests of the Reich leadership of the
NSDAP <span class='it'>vis a vis</span> both the German and the foreign press. It
alone has the authority to issue directives to the press of
Reich policies concerning the treatment of Party affairs. It
alone has the authority to issue press directives to all offices
of Reich leadership. It is responsible for the political and
editorial preparations, execution and utilization of all important
Party activities in the Reich. It supplies the domestic
and foreign press with information, news and commentaries
about the Party. It keeps a record of press reaction
to the Party work in publications of the domestic and foreign
press.” (<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Press Chief exercised control over all press offices,
including the chief editors of the National Socialist newspapers,
as well as the <span class='it'>Gau</span> press wardens of the Party. He also served
as liaison officer between the Party press and the “Independent”
press, and between Party and Government. (<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The executive functions of the Reich Press Chief were carried
out by two offices:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>The Pressepolitisches Amt</span> (Press Political Office).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>The Pressepersonalamt</span> (Press Personnel Office), which
was in charge of training journalists and keeping files on German
and foreign journalists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vertical organization of press controls, corresponding to
that of the <span class='it'>Reichspropagandaleitung</span>, included <span class='it'>Gau-</span>, <span class='it'>Kreis-</span> and
<span class='it'>Ortsgruppen</span> departments. Each was headed by an <span class='it'>Amtsleiter</span>,
or press warden, who was responsible for the entire Party press
within his sphere of jurisdiction. He supervised the editorial
policy of the Party press, issued information bulletins about the
activities of the Movement, and served as liaison officer between
the Party and non-Party press. He also transmitted local information
to headquarters for distribution and made recommendations
concerning the appointments of local party editors. The
<span class='it'>Gau-</span> and <span class='it'>Kreis-</span> press wardens, at the same time, served as regional
and local representatives of the Home Press Division of
the Propaganda Ministry and of the Reich Press Chamber. (<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2315-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Reichsleiter fuer die Presse</span> (Reich Press Leader).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Press Leader, Max Amann, was charged with supervising
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
all matters concerning the German publishing business.
The <span class='it'>Organisationsbuch der NSDAP</span> (1937) described his function
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“He is charged with the creation of a press for the German
people, which is responsible and answerable to him, and
which reflects the life and experiences of the German people’s
community. In addition, the Reichsleiter for Press has the
function of issuing regulations necessary to carry out the demands
concerning publication policies established in Article
23 of the Party Program and to supervise their execution.”
(<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Article 23 of the Party Platform referred to above, provided,
<span class='it'>inter alia</span>, that (a) all editors and newspaper personnel must be
“members of the nation”; (b) non-Germans are prohibited from
financial participation in, or influence of, newspapers; (c) the
publication of papers “which do not conduce to the national welfare”
is prohibited; (d) tendencies in art or literature “of a kind
likely to disintegrate our life as a nation” will be prosecuted; and
(e) “institutions which militate against the requirements mentioned
above” will be suppressed. (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the Reich Press Leader was not only empowered to control
all publishing houses of the Party, but was assigned the task
of bringing the entire German press into line with National Socialist
ideology. To this end he was given wide and specific powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sphere of jurisdiction included specifically:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) The administration, publishing, and financing of the Party
press;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) The establishment of newspapers by Party members or
affiliated associations;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) The incorporation of newspapers into the Party press combine;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) The appointment of publishers and of their deputies;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) The termination or alteration of contracts with newspapers;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>f</span>) The appointment of Commissars to supervise publishing
houses. (<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to controlling the administration and finance of the
National Socialist publishing houses in the <span class='it'>Gau</span>, the Press Leader
headed the <span class='it'>Zentralverlag</span>, which was the central publishing house
and holding company of the entire Party publishing machine and
all its official organs, such as <span class='it'>Der Voelkischer Beobachter</span>, <span class='it'>Der Angriff</span>,
<span class='it'>Der SA Mann</span>, <span class='it'>Das Schwarze Korps</span>, <span class='it'>Die HJ</span>, etc. (<span class='it'>3016-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one of the Reich Press Leader’s duties to turn all publishing
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
by Party officials into a lucrative undertaking, and to set
up an absolute monopoly in the publication of all political literature.
To effectuate that objective, a decree was passed which
made it mandatory for all “manuscripts which have National Socialist
problems and subject matter as themes” to be offered first
to <span class='it'>Eher Verlag</span> publication. (<span class='it'>2383-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Reichsleiter fuer die Press</span>, who was also president of the
Reich Press Chamber, exercised economic controls over the entire
German press. He made use of his position to expand the
Party publishing machine at the expense of non-party newspapers.
As president of the Reich Press Chamber, he was authorized
to issue directives with the force of law. In that capacity he
issued certain regulations which had the effect of prohibiting the
ownership of newspapers by corporations of any kind, except the
NSDAP or such groups as were approved by the Party. (<span class='it'>2315-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>These decrees enabled Amann to close down one or more papers
in a particular locality “to safeguard reasonable standards
of competition.” They thus provided, along with racial and other
discriminatory legislation, the “legal” basis for the pressure which
was brought to bear on such publishing firms as Ullstein and
other opposition publications, in order to force them to sell out to
the Party. These sales were in no sense voluntary; the alternative
in each case was total suppression. The authorizing decree provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The President of the Reich Chamber of the Press will therefore
endeavor at first in every individual case to effect agreements
which will relieve him of the necessity of issuing orders
for the closing of establishments.” (<span class='it'>2315-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Max Amann has admitted in an affidavit that he discharged his
duties as Reich Press Leader consistently with the statement of
his functions contained in the Party Organization Book and with
Article 23 of the Party Program. He has further stated that racial
and other discriminatory legislation made it expedient for
firms “owned or controlled by Jewish interests, or by political or
religious interests hostile to the NSDAP * * * to sell their
newspapers or assets to the Eher concern”; and that there was
“no free market for the sale of such properties and the Franz
Eher Verlag was generally the only bidder.” His affidavit concludes
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is a true statement to say that the basic purpose of the
Nazi press program was to eliminate all press in opposition
to the Party.” (<span class='it'>3016-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Parteiamliche Prufungskommission zum Schutz des NS-Christums</span>
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>
(Office of Party Examining Commission for the Protection
of National Socialist Publications) (PPK).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The PPK was charged with the censorship and supervision of
all literature with cultural or political implications. According
to the Party Manual:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The functional scope of the official Party Examining Commission
is not confined to any one group of publications but
includes the entire publishing field. Thus the work of the
Official Party Examining Commission is sub-divided into departments
for books, magazines and newspapers. Out of
these main departments a group of important special fields
have emerged as more or less independent fields. They are
specifically the editing of speeches, scientific books, textbooks,
scientific periodicals and the calendar as a special
type of magazine.” (<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Examining Commission’s function was to protect National
Socialist literature from attempts to destroy its propagandistic
effect or to pervert its political and social content. The Party
Manual stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is the function of the Examining Commission to protect
the National Socialist literature from abuse, corruption, and
attempts at dissolution. Thus it forestalls the infiltration
of elements within the National Socialist literature which
are irreconcilable with it.” (<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, the PPK concerned itself with the actual suppression
of literature incompatible with Party tenets, and with the
approval of those works which it deemed beneficial to the extension
of the National Socialist ideology. The Party Manual specified
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Particularly it is the function of the official Party Examining
Commission to determine whether or not a work can be
considered National Socialist literature.” (<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This office worked in close collaboration with the Delegate of
the Fuehrer for the Total Supervision of the Intellectual and
Ideological Training and Education of the People (Rosenberg).
(<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2383-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>The Beauftragte des Fuehrers fuer die Ueberwachung der
gesamten geistigen und weltansschaulichen Schulung und Erziehung
der NSDAP</span> (Delegate of the Fuehrer for the Total Supervision
of the Intellectual and Ideological Training and Education
of the Party) (BdF).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The delegate of the Fuehrer was <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Alfred Rosenberg.
The Office of the BdF was placed in charge of the Party’s
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>
intellectual and ideological training and education. Its declared
objective was the uniform ideological orientation of the Party,
Party formations, and affiliated associations. Its main functions,
in furtherance of this objective, were the preparation of suitable
training materials and the issuance of directives thereon; the
preparation, editing, and establishment of curricula; the training
of qualified teaching staffs; the counseling of Party agencies,
formations, and affiliates on content and methods of indoctrination;
and the elimination of such reading and teaching materials
as were deemed inappropriate from a National Socialist point of
view. To perform these tasks, Rosenberg had the assistance of a
large organization with numerous functional divisions (<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>).
The BdF took a major part in the work of Party organizations,
affiliated associations, and schools and training institutes
which were instrumental in the indoctrination of the German
people and youth. (<span class='it'>2383-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>The Reich government organization.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The state organ of control was the <span class='it'>Reichsministerium fuer
Volksaufklaerung und Propaganda</span> (Reich Ministry for Popular
Enlightenment and Propaganda). The Minister was Josef Goebbels.
The Ministry was founded by decree dated 13 March 1933,
which defined its duties as the “enlightenment of, and propaganda
among, the people on the subject of the policy of the Reich
government and on the national reconstruction of the homeland.”
(<span class='it'>2029-PS</span>). By decree dated 30 June 1933 the functions of the
Minister were extended to include “jurisdiction over the whole
field of spiritual indoctrination of the nation, of propagandizing
the State, of cultural and economic propaganda, of enlightenment
of the public at home and abroad; furthermore he is in charge of
all institutions serving these purposes.” (<span class='it'>2030-PS</span>). In the words
of Mueller, an authority on the Propaganda Ministry, these decrees
formed the basis for the creation of a central agency for
propaganda “the like of which heretofore existed nowhere in the
world.” (<span class='it'>2434-PS</span>). The influence which this agency exerted on
the everyday life and activities of the German citizen was illustrated
by the multitude of civic and cultural affairs, including
public entertainment, which fell under the sweep of its direction
and control. (<span class='it'>2434-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few of the more important departments of the Propaganda
Ministry, together with a brief description of their respective
functions, follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Personnel.</span> This department issued directives for unified
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
personnel policy, and exercised general supervision over the personnel
of public art instituted within the entire Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Law.</span> “The nuclear task of the law department is the publication
and execution of national socialist cultural laws. The
professions and institutions of literature and art had to be transformed
from carriers of a liberal individualistic intellectual
movement to the carriers of the tasks of public propaganda and
leadership. To reach this goal required the enactment of governmental
decrees for creating new organizations or the making of
new laws.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Propaganda.</span> This department coordinated propaganda
policies and issued over-all directives to the various functional
departments (press, radio, etc.) which then carried out the directives.
A special function was “enlightenment of the people as
to Jewish question” and as to “racial policies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Foreign.</span> This department was the Ministry’s listening
post for political and economic developments abroad “to counteract
the worldwide publicity activities of the enemy against our
philosophy and our political objectives by exposing and rectifying
the lies of the press” and to exploit the information in German
propaganda. It also cooperated closely with the <span class='it'>Auslandsorganization
der NSDAP</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Radio.</span> Hans Fritzsche headed this department. It supervised
the political content of German broadcasting, issued directives
as to the arrangement of programs and treatment of material,
and cooperated with the Party in the technical organization
of German radio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) The <span class='it'>Film Department</span> was in charge of directing and
guiding the German film industry, censoring of films, and developing
the German weekly newsreel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Literature.</span> This agency, in close collaboration with BdF
and PPK, controlled all German literary activities, censored new
books, provided for the publication of German books abroad, and
arranged for the translation and censorship of foreign books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(8) <span class='it'>Abteilung Deutsche Presse</span> (German or Home Press Department).
This department was headed by Fritzsche until he
was relieved in 1942 to take charge of the Radio Division. It was
responsible for political control over the entire German press;
it controlled the editorial policy of the press and its personnel
(through the Reich Press Chamber), and supervised the dissemination
of news through the official German News Agency
(DNB). The Home Press Division outlined the editorial policy
of all newspapers and the comment of editors and journalists in
its daily directives. (<span class='it'>Tendenz berichte</span>). These dealt with the
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
daily contents of the paper, the methods of treatment of news
material, the writing of headlines, the preference for or omission
of certain items, and the modification or cessation of current
campaigns. The directives were issued to the representatives
of the press in person or sent through the facilities of the DNB
to the local papers. (<span class='it'>2434-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2529-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Home Press Department of the Propaganda Ministry had
an important participation in administering the provisions of the
Editorial Control Law, which made the profession of editor “a
public task, which is regulated as to its professional duties and
rights by the state.” That law also included requirements for admission
to the profession and other elaborate controls. (<span class='it'>2083-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(9) <span class='it'>Periodical Literature.</span> This department supervised German
periodical literature in the same manner as the <span class='it'>Abteilung
Deutsche Presse</span> controlled the daily press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other divisions exercised supervision over the Theatre (selection
and supervision of the entire dramatic production and influencing
the programs of all German Theatres); the Arts; Music
(“the entire cultural and political leadership of German musical
life”); Special Cultural Tasks (“This department serves mainly
to eliminate all Jews from German Cultural life”); and Foreign
Tourists. (<span class='it'>2434-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A large organization of faithful Party followers was recruited
to discharge the manifold functions of the Propaganda Ministry.
The staff numbered 1000 persons in 1939-1940. In the words of
Mueller:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is no accident; therefore, that the great majority of the
official workers and other personnel of the Ministry consist
of reliable National Socialists of which almost 100 are bearers
of the Gold Party Pin.” (<span class='it'>2434-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>The semi-autonomous professional organizations Reichskulturkammer</span>
(Reich Chamber of Culture).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Chamber of Culture was set up in September 1933
to control (under the supervision of the Propaganda Ministry
and within the framework of general policy directives issued by
that activity) personnel engaged in all fields of propaganda
(<span class='it'>2082-PS</span>). Its tasks as described in the First Executive Decree
of the above law, dated 1 November 1933, were:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“To promote German culture as responsible to the people
and the Reich, to regulate the social and economic relations
of the different groups in the cultural professions and to
coordinate their aims.” (<span class='it'>2415-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Reichskulturkammer</span> was a so-called “<span class='it'>Nachgeordnete
Dienststelle</span>” (Subordinate office) of the Propaganda Ministry.
Together with its subordinate Chambers it was charged with
supervising all personnel active in any field under the jurisdiction
of the Propaganda Ministry. All persons employed in the cultural
professions were obligated to register with one of the subordinate
Chambers. The Chambers were also responsible for investigating
the activities and political reliability of their members.
Moreover, power was given to Chambers to prosecute members offending
against Nazi standards or persons pursuing their occupation
without being duly registered. The punitive powers included,
expulsion from membership, which was tantamount to the loss
of livelihood. The Chambers were also given power to issue directives,
which had the validity of law, regulating the cultural activities
under their control (<span class='it'>2529-PS</span>). The President of the Chamber
of Culture was the Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels,
who nominated the Vice-Presidents. In 1937, the latter consisted
of Walter Funk, Max Amann (Reich Leader of the Press) and
Leopold Gutterer (Secretary of State in the Propaganda Ministry).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chamber of Culture was divided into seven functional
chambers:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Reichspressekammer</span> (Reich Press Chamber). Max Amann
was president of this chamber, which was, to a greater extent
than the other chambers, a loose association of technical bodies
and organizations, such as the Reich Association of German
Newspaper Publishers. It integrated the activities of these
groups and, through the composition of its governing body, ensured
close coordination with Party and State propaganda machinery.
(<span class='it'>2529-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3016-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Reichskammer der bildenden Kunste</span> (Reich Chamber of
Fine Arts). This chamber supervised the activities of all architects,
interior decorators, landscape gardeners, sculptors,
painters, draftsmen, art publishers, etc. By 1937, all other art
groups and associations had been dissolved, and all their members
“obligated by profession” to join this chamber. (<span class='it'>2529-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Reichsmusikkammer</span> (Reich Music Chamber). This Chamber
was organized to “oversee the practice and activity of
musicians in their cultural, economic, and legal relationships
with the world. * * * in order that music will still remain
a prized possession of the German people.” (<span class='it'>2529-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Reichstheaterkammer</span> (Reich Theater Chamber). The
Theater Chamber was the professional organization for the entire
field of the professional theater. Its purpose was to supervise
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>
and promote the “cultural, social and economic conditions of
the professions which it includes”. Actual censorship of stage
production was the responsibility of the <span class='it'>Reichsdramaturg</span>. (<span class='it'>2529-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Reichsfilmkammer</span> (Reich Film Chamber). The primary
function of this Chamber was to lift the film industry “out of the
sphere of liberal economic thoughts” by giving it a sound economic
foundation and thus enable it to “receive those tasks which
it has to fulfill in the National Socialist State”. (<span class='it'>2529-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>Reichsschrifttumskammer</span> (Reich Chamber of Literature).
The Chamber of Literature had jurisdiction over all persons concerned
with the “basic production” (writing and publishing) of
literature. Its task was to protect writers “from undesirable elements”
and to keep out of the book market everything “unGerman.”
It had the further function of bringing literature to the
people and making the writer more “aware of his duty to the
nation.” Primary responsibility for critical evaluation and censorship
of literature however, was left to the Propaganda Ministry.
(<span class='it'>2529-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Reichsrundfunkkammer</span> (Reich Radio Chamber). The
official gazette of the Reich Culture Chamber stated that the
radio was the most immediate propaganda instrument of the
National Socialist leadership; that the ideal and cultural life of
the nation could be shown “totally” in and through the radio;
and that since the radio constituted the most important technical
means of influencing the masses it was necessary to establish a
close tie between the radio and the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Functions of the Radio Chamber included: mobilizing of all
technical possibilities of broadcasting, bringing the people closer
to radio, planning the manufacture of cheap receiving sets, and
propaganda in connection with the drive for new listeners. (<span class='it'>2529-PS</span>)

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg341a'>10. MILITARIZATION OF NAZI ORGANIZATIONS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators placed many of their organizations
on a progressively militarized footing with a view to the rapid
transformation and use of such organizations as instruments of
war.</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Schutzstaffeln (SS).</span> The SS was militarized beginning
in March 1933, when special, volunteer, armed units were
created consisting of full-time garrisoned troops. These units,
which rapidly grew in strength, were a part neither of the Wehrmacht,
nor of the police, but were exclusively at the disposal of
the Fuehrer. This militarization of the SS was in accordance
with Nazi policy. (For documentation and further discussion
see Chapter XV, Section 5.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Sturmabteilung (SA).</span> The SA was founded in 1921
as a para-military organization to fight political enemies of the
Nazis. After the accession of the Nazis to power, the SA was
used to provide pre-military training at a time when the Reichswehr
was legally limited to a strength of 100,000 men. Thus the
SA, from its inception, had a military purpose, which was carried
out and gradually increased in scope. (For documentation
and further discussion see Chapter XV, Section 4.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Hitler Jugend (HJ).</span> One of the chief purposes of the
Hitler Jugend was to provide for military training of German
youth at a very early age. As early as 1933, the HJ entered into
a secret program of extensive pre-military training for German
youth in conjunction with the SA and the Wehrmacht. In addition
to general military training, members of the HJ were given
specialized training in various types of military units, such as
flying units, naval units, motorized units, signal units, etc. (For
documentation and further discussion, see Section 8, <span class='it'>supra</span>.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>The National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK).</span> The original
NSKK was founded under the name of NSAK (National
Socialist Automobile Corps) on 1 April 1930 by Hitler, who
joined as its first member. By the end of 1931 it had a membership
of approximately 10,000, as compared to 300 at the beginning
of that year (<span class='it'>2804-PS</span>). In 1934 the motorized Hitler
Jugend and the motorized SA were placed under the NSKK.
Hitler, on 23 August of that year, decreed that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“the NSAK and the motorized SA are from now on welded
together into a unit called NSKK. The NSKK is directly
subordinate to me”. (<span class='it'>2804-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Thus the NSKK was elevated to the position of an independent
affiliated unit of the NSDAP, similar to the SA and the SS. The
membership of the enlarged NSKK grew rapidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The military purpose of the NSKK is evident from the following
statement from The <span class='it'>Organizationbuch der NSDAP</span> (1940):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The young driver who has received his training in the six-week
courses of the NSKK will be well prepared in body and
spirit when the time comes for his military service, and will
wear with pride the dress of the Armed Forces of the Nation.”
(<span class='it'>2320-B-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The program of militarization proceeded rapidly:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“More than one-third of all leaders and men of the NSKK,
which had in the meantime grown to a membership of 350,000,
were already active in the fight for power * * *
Thus, the NSKK had in its ranks, in addition to the proud
tradition of the period of our fight, also that of the World
War. This front spirit and experience of a generation matured
to manhood in the barrages, in the battles of attrition,
in the battles of the Freikorps, and in the heroic fight of National
Socialism for Germany’s rebirth, is passed on to our
youth as a sacred heritage.” (<span class='it'>2804-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The training given to NSKK members was intended to furnish
seasoned recruits for the Nazi military forces.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Military motorized training of our youth is the cardinal
task of the educational work of the NSKK. Here it collaborates
most closely with the bearer of the arms of the Reich,
the Wehrmacht, and it has done so already throughout the
years before the seizure of power. The demands and needs
of the Army, which continuously grew in scope after the
awakening of our Nation and after our regained military
freedom also caused the tasks and the work of the NSKK
in the field of military motorized training to grow correspondingly
* * * By order of the Fuehrer and Supreme
Commander of the Wehrmacht, the NSKK has been
given charge of the pre-military training of the entire young
reserve of the motorized troop units of our Army in addition
to post-military training.” (<span class='it'>2804-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>NSKK-trained men were intended to be assimilated into Reich
Panzer units.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Well prepared physically and spiritually, the young German
man who has now become a motorized soldier, can serve with
a motorized or partially-motorized unit of the Army. To
become a tank soldier is his only ambition.” (<span class='it'>2804-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The NSKK was actually used for military purposes.
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The men of the NSKK have considerably contributed to the
liberation of the Sudetenland by the Fuehrer and have thus
gained undying merit, not only for the Germans in the Sudetenland,
but for the entire German people as a whole.”
(<span class='it'>2804-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Further evidence of actual military use of the NSKK is given in
the following passage from “<span class='it'>Deutschland im Kampf</span>” written by
<span class='it'>Ministerialdirigent</span> A. J. Berndt of the Reich Propaganda Ministry
and Lt. Col. von Wedel of the German Army High Command,
in the issue of June 1940:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The NSKK is playing a decisive part in the carrying out of
considerable war-important tasks on the Inner Front, one of
which is traffic. * * * Among the tasks of the NSKK
are pre-military training, education, and schooling and motorized
transport. Thus, for instance, the conducting of the
entire transport system of the TODT Organization on the
West Wall and the traffic in the Western War Theater are in
the hands of the NSKK.” (<span class='it'>2810-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>The National Socialist Aviation Corps (NSFK).</span> The
NSFK was another organization affiliated with the NSDAP used
by the Nazi conspirators for military purposes. It was the great
training school for the Luftwaffe.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the endeavor to assure for the German Luftwaffe a numerically
strong and well prepared reserve, and to strengthen
in the German people the conviction that Germany must retain
its head-start in all spheres of aviation, the NSFK was
founded by the Fuehrer on 17 April 1937 * * *.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The NSFK at the time of its creation, was given the following
tasks by the Reichsmarshal:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Pre-military aviation training of the new blood for the
Luftwaffe.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The keeping in training of the reservists of the aviation
troops.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The combining and directing of all German air sports.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. Promotion and extension of the aviation idea among the
German people.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“These tasks are so great that the cooperation of tens of
thousands of active members is necessary to make carrying
them out possible, so that the Luftwaffe may be able at any
time to count on their fulfillment according to plan.”
(<span class='it'>2811-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The paramount military purpose of the NSFK is clearly indicated
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>
in the following admission by <span class='it'>Generalleutnant</span> Friedrich
Christiansen, <span class='it'>Korpsfuehrer</span> of the NSFK:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Schooled in character, trained physically as a flier, and as
a soldier, the member-to-be of the Luftwaffe leaves the
NSFK.” (<span class='it'>2813-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>The Reichsarbeitdienst (RAD)</span> (The Reich Labor Service).
The Reich Labor Service was also subverted to military purposes
by the Nazi conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Membership in the RAD was made compulsory for both young
men and women on 26 June 1935.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“All young Germans of either sex between 18-25 years of
age are obligated to serve their people in the Reich Labor
Service. As the schooling of the Nation, it has as its object
this education of the German Youth to National Socialist
Ideology.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Labor Service for men is, thanks to its military
nature, closely-knit units, and its particular education and
training an ever-ready, powerful tool of the National Socialist
Reich.” (<span class='it'>2805-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The tens of thousands of members of the RAD were militarily
trained and ready for action when Germany launched her campaigns
of aggression. Actual military use of the men of the RAD
is clearly shown in the 1 June 1943 edition of “<span class='it'>Fuehren und Erziehen</span>”
(Leadership and Education), the official magazine of the
Reich Labor Service. A photograph depicts a Labor Service man
repairing a bridge at the front, across which four infantrymen
are proceeding, and is titled as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The young crews who have gone through the educational
institutions of the Reich Labor Service today represent the
most active nucleus of our Army. * * * Our photograph
shows labor men who in the East are preparing the way for
infantry shock troops by repairing a bridge. Thus also the
men of the Reich Labor Service are today one of the examples
of eternal German soldierdom.” (<span class='it'>2806-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The military uses of the RAD are further described in the following
letter written by Goering to Reich Labor Service Leader
Konstantin Hierl:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“After the victorious termination of the campaign in Poland,
I cannot but convey to you my sincere thanks for and unreserved
recognition of the help rendered by the Reich Labor
Service in the carrying out of the operations of the Luftwaffe.
In guarding Army airfields, in clearing and quickly
repairing former enemy airports, in road construction and
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
in bringing up supplies, everywhere your men have done a
real job and have thus contributed considerably to the
successes of the German Luftwaffe.” (<span class='it'>2807-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>The TODT Organization (OT).</span> The TODT Organization,
or OT, was another NSDAP affiliate used to further the militaristic
aims of the Nazi conspirators. The OT, originally an offshoot of
the RAD, was created as a separate entity in June 1938 when
Dr. Fritz Todt was charged with the construction of the Siegfried
Line or West Wall. The military employment of the OT is clearly
shown in the following passage from “<span class='it'>Maenner der OT</span>”, which
was published by the Photographic Office of the Reich Propaganda
Office:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“No sooner had the greatest and most modern fortifications
of the world, the West Wall, been completed by the workers
of the OT, when these very same workers were called upon
by the Fuehrer to prove their worth also in direct front service
* * * and they thus helped * * * to achieve
the greatest victory in history. When the great offensive in
the west began, the brown workers’ columns of the TODT
organization followed immediately behind them. After the
armistice with France had been signed, an entirely new situation
developed for the TODT organization. Its columns had
pushed deep into enemy country. Not seldom did they have
direct contact with the enemy—their losses in dead and
wounded and the Iron Cross awards are heroic proof of that.
While, as the foremost construction workers of the German
Reich, they had already proved their worth when building
the West Wall, they were now able to perfect what they had
learned in the fight against the British world enemy. From
the Channel coast to the Atlantic Ocean, the front technicians
and front workers of the OT now proceeded to create the
prerequisites for a successful fight against England.”
(<span class='it'>2808-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Though the OT was in its origin technically a civilian organization,
it subsequently became a para-military body which, before
and during the war, cooperated fully with the German Army. On
2 July 1940, a directive was issued from the German High Command
appointing a liaison officer.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * to establish the closest liaison and cooperation
of the respective military offices with the main construction
work of the TODT Organization.” (<span class='it'>2812-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This militarization of the OT is further shown in the following
passage from “<span class='it'>Nationalsozialistische Monatschefte</span>” for 1942:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“From the Autobahn workers was developed the ‘Organization
TODT’ a body of hundreds of thousands of workers who
<span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>
help the Wehrmacht everywhere in eliminating obstacles,
building bridges and erecting fortifications and shelters. The
front soldier and the front worker stand side by side. Together
they have shed their blood in this war and together
they have won victories. Long-range guns on the Channel
coast, U-boat bases on the Atlantic, and now the East will
render the ‘OT’ immortal for all times to come.” (<span class='it'>2809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A letter from Fritz Sauckel to Hitler, dated 17 May 1943, states
that the OT had supplied 248,200 workers by March 1943 for the
completion of the Atlantic Wall, and praises the OT for its excellent
work in this regard. (<span class='it'>407-VIII-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By 1938, all phases of German life <span class='it'>had been</span> mobilized for the
accomplishment of militant aims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler declared to the Reichstag on 20 February 1938:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Only now we have succeeded in setting before us the great
tasks and in possessing the material things which are the
prerequisites for the realization of great creative plans in all
fields of our national existence. Thus, National Socialism
has made up within a few years for what centuries before it
had omitted. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“National Socialism has given the German people that leadership
which as party not only mobilizes the nation but also
organizes it, so that on the basis of the natural principle of
selection, the continuance of a stable political leadership is
safeguarded forever * * * National Socialism * * *
possesses Germany entirely and completely since the day
when, five years ago, I left the house in Wilhelmplatz as
Reich Chancellor. There is no institution in this state which
is not National Socialist. Above all, however, the National
Socialist Party in these five years not only has made the nation
National Socialist, but also has given itself that perfect
organizational structure which guarantees its permanence
for all future. <span class='it'>The greatest guarantee of the National Socialist
revolution lies in the complete domination of the Reich
and all its institutions and organizations, internally and externally,
by the National Socialist Party. Its protection
against the world abroad, however, lies in its new National
Socialist armed forces.</span> * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In this Reich, anybody who has a responsible position is a
National Socialist. * * * Every institution of this Reich
is under the orders of the supreme political leadership.
* * * The party leads the Reich politically, the armed
forces defend it militarily. * * * There is nobody in any
responsible position in this state who doubts that I am the
authorized leader of this Reich.” (<span class='it'>2715-PS</span>)</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span><h1>Chapter VIII<br/> ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THE CONSPIRACY</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It is well known that the Nazi conspirators rearmed Germany
on a vast scale. The purpose of that rearmament is revealed in
the secret records of the plans and deliberations of the inner councils
of the Nazis. These records show that the reorganization of
the German government, the financial wizardry of Hjalmar
Schacht, and the total mobilization of the German economy largely
under Hjalmar Schacht, Hermann Goering, and Walter Funk,
were directed at a single goal: aggressive war.</p>

<h3>I. ECONOMIC MOBILIZATION FOR WAR</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The significance of the economic measures adopted and applied
by the conspirators can be properly appraised only if they are
placed in the larger social and political context of Nazi Germany.
These economic measures were adopted while the conspirators
were directing their vast propaganda apparatus to the glorification
of war. They were adopted while the conspirators were perverting
physical training into training for war. They were
adopted while these conspirators were threatening to use force
and were planning to use force to achieve their material and political
objects. In short, these measures constitute in the field of
economics and government administration the same preparation
for aggressive war which dominated every aspect of the Nazi
state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1939 and 1940, after the Nazi aggression upon Poland, Holland,
Belgium, and France, it became clear to the world that the
Nazi conspirators had created probably the greatest instrument
of aggression in history. That machine was built up almost in its
entirety in a period of less than one decade. In May of 1939 Major
General George Thomas, former Chief of the Military-Economic
Staff in the Reich War Ministry, reported that the German Army
had grown from seven Infantry divisions in 1933 to thirty-nine
Infantry divisions, among them four fully motorized and three
mountain divisions; eighteen Corps Headquarters; five Panzer
divisions; twenty-two machine gun battalions. Moreover, General
Thomas stated that the German Navy had greatly expanded
by the launching, among other vessels, of two battleships of thirty-five
thousand tons, four heavy cruisers of ten thousand tons,
and other warships; further, that the Luftwaffe had grown to a
point where it had a strength of two hundred sixty thousand men,
twenty-one squadrons, consisting of two hundred forty echelons,
and thirty-three Anti-Aircraft Batteries. (<span class='it'>EC-28</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>
General Thomas further reported, in a lecture delivered on 24
May 1939 in the Nazi Foreign Office, that out of the few factories
permitted by the Versailles Treaty there had arisen * * *</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The mightiest armament industry now existing in the world.
It has attained the performances which in part equal the
German wartime performances and in part even surpasses
them. Germany’s crude steel production is today the largest
in the world after the Americans. The aluminum production
exceeds that of America and of the other countries of the
world very considerably. The output of our rifle, machine
gun, and artillery factories is at present larger than that of
any other state.” (<span class='it'>EC-28</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These results—about which General Thomas spoke in his book
entitled <span class='it'>Basic Facts for a History of German War and Armaments
Economy</span>—were achieved only by making preparation for
war the dominating objective of German economy. As General
Thomas stated on page 479 of his book:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“History will know only a few examples of cases where a
country has directed, even in peace time, all its economic
forces deliberately and systematically towards the requirements
of war, as Germany was compelled to do in the period
between the two World Wars.” (<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The task of mobilizing the German economy for aggressive war
began promptly after the Nazi conspirators’ seizure of power.
It was entrusted principally to Schacht, Goering, and Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht was appointed President of the Reichsbank in March
1933, and Minister of Economics in August 1934. The world did
not know, however, that the responsibility for the execution of
this program was entrusted to the office of the Four Year Plan
under Goering (<span class='it'>EC-408</span>). Nor did the world know that Schacht
was designated Plenipotentiary for the War Economy on 21 May
1935, with complete control over the German civilian economy for
war production in the Reich Defense Council, established by a
top secret Hitler decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A letter dated 24 June 1935, at Berlin, and signed by von Blomberg,
reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor has nominated
the President of the directorate of the Reichsbank, Dr.
Schacht, to be Plenipotentiary-General for War Economy.
* * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * I point out the necessity of strictest secrecy once
more * * *.” (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Through Schacht’s financial genius monetary measures were devised
to restore German industry to full production; and through
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>
the control of imports and exports, which he devised under his
new plan of 1934, German production was channeled in accordance
with the requirements of the German war machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1936, with an eye to the experience in the First World War,
the Nazi conspirators embarked on an ambitious plan to make
Germany completely self-sufficient in strategic war materials
such as rubber, gasoline, and steel, in a period of four years, so
that Germany would be fully prepared for aggressive war. The
responsibility for the execution of this program was entrusted to
the office of the Four Year Plan under Goering. A “memorandum
on the Four Year Plan and Preparation of the War Economy,”
dated 30 December 1936, and marked “Secret Command Matter”,
sets out that the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor has conferred
powers in regard to mobilization preparations in the economic
field that need further definition. The third paragraph refers
specifically to Minister-President, Generaloberst Goering as Commissioner
of the Four Year Plan, by authority of the Fuehrer and
Reich Chancellor granted 18 October 1936. The existence of this
program involved the reorganization and control of the whole
German economy for war. (<span class='it'>EC-408</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The military objectives of the German economy were clearly
stated by General Thomas in a lecture on 28 February 1939, delivered
at the Staff Instructor’s course. He stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The National Socialist State, soon after taking over the
power, has reorganized the German economy in all sections
and directed it towards a military viewpoint, which had been
requested by the Army for years. Due to the reorganization,
agriculture, commerce and professions became those
powerful instruments the Fuehrer needs for his extensive
plans, and we can say today that Hitler’s mobile politics, as
well as the powerful efforts of the Army and economy, would
not have been possible without the necessary reorganization
by the National Socialist Government. We can now say that
the economic organization as a whole corresponds with the
needs, although slight adjustments will have to be made
yet. Those reorganizations made a new system of economics
possible which was necessary in view of our internal and
foreign political situation as well as our financial problems.
The directed economy, as we have it today, concerning agriculture,
commerce and industry, is not only the expression of
the present State principles, but at the same time also the
economy of the country’s defense.” (<span class='it'>EC-27</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This program was not undertaken in a vacuum; it was deliberately
designed and executed to provide the necessary instrument
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
of the Nazi conspirators’ plans for aggressive war. In September
1934 Schacht admitted to the American Ambassador in Berlin
that the Hitler Party was absolutely committed to war, and that
the people too were ready and willing. (<span class='it'>EC-461</span>) At the same
time Schacht promulgated his new plan for the control of imports
and exports in the interest of rearmament. A year later he was
appointed Plenipotentiary for War Economy by top secret decree.
(<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 4 September 1936 Goering announced, at a Cabinet meeting
attended by von Blomberg, Schacht, and others, that Hitler had
issued instructions to the Reich War Minister on the basis that
“the show-down with Russia is inevitable,” and added that “all
measures have to be taken just as if we were actually in the stage
of imminent danger of war.” (<span class='it'>EC-416</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same month the office of the Four Year Plan was
created with the mission of making Germany self-sufficient for
war in four years. Goering regarded it as his task, within four
years, to put the entire economy in a state of readiness for war.
(<span class='it'>EC-408</span>)</p>

<h3>2. COLLABORATION OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS IN REARMAMENT</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Although the Nazi government officials provided the leadership
in preparing Germany for war, they received also the enthusiastic
and invaluable cooperation of the German industrialists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the invitation of Goering, approximately 25 of the leading
industrialists of Germany, together with Schacht, attended a
meeting in Berlin on 20 February 1933. This was shortly before
the German election of 5 March 1933. At this meeting Hitler
announced the conspirators’ aim to seize totalitarian control
over Germany, to destroy the parliamentary system, to crush all
opposition by force, and to restore the power of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>.
Among those present at that meeting were Gustav Krupp, head
of the munitions firm, Alfried Krupp, A.G.; four leading officials
of the I. G. Farben Works, one of the world’s largest chemical
concerns; Albert Vogler, head of United Steel Works of Germany;
and other leading industrialists. This meeting is described in the
following affidavit of George von Schnitzler:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I, George von Schnitzler, a member of the Vorstand of I.
G. Farben, make the following deposition under oath:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At the end of February 1933, four members of the Vorstand
of I. G. Farben, including Dr. Bosch, the head of the
Vorstand, and myself were asked by the office of the President
of the Reichstag to attend a meeting in his house, the
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>
purpose of which was not given. I do not remember the
two other colleagues of mine who were also invited. I believe
the invitation reached me during one of my business
trips to Berlin. I went to the meeting which was attended
by about 20 persons, who I believe were mostly leading industrialists
from the Ruhr.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Among those present I remember:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Dr. Schacht, who at that time was not yet head of the
<span class='it'>Reichsbank</span> again and not yet Minister of Economics.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Krupp von Bohlen, who in the beginning of 1933 presided
over the <span class='it'>Reichsverband der Deutschen Industrie</span>, which later
on was changed into the semi-official organization ‘<span class='it'>Reichsgruppe
Industrie</span>.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Dr. Albert Vogler, the leading man of the <span class='it'>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</span>.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Von Lowenfeld from an industrial work in Essen.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Dr. Stein, head of the <span class='it'>Gewerkschaft Auguste Victoria</span>, a
mine which belongs to the I. G. Dr. Stein was an active
member of the <span class='it'>Deutsche Volkspartei</span>.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I remember that Dr. Schacht acted as a kind of host.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“While I had expected the appearance of Goering, Hitler
entered the room, shook hands with everybody and took a
seat at the top of the table. In a long speech, he talked
mainly about the danger of communism over which he pretended
that he just had won a decisive victory.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“He then talked about the <span class='it'>Bundnis</span>—alliance—into which his
party and the <span class='it'>Deutsch Nationale Volkspartei</span> had entered.
This latter party, in the meantime, had been reorganized by
Herr von Papen. At the end he came to the point which
seemed to me the purpose of the meeting. Hitler stressed
the importance that the two aforementioned parties should
gain the majority in the coming Reichstag election. Krupp
von Bohlen thanked Hitler for his speech. After Hitler had
left the room, Dr. Schacht proposed to the meeting the raising
of an election fund of, as far as I remember, RM 3,000,000.
The fund should be distributed between the two ‘allies’
according to their relative strength at the time being. Dr.
Stein suggested that the <span class='it'>Deutsche Volkspartei</span> should be included
* * *.” (<span class='it'>EC-439</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech delivered to the industrialists in Berlin on 20 February
1933, Hitler stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of
democracy; it is conceivable only if the people have a sound
idea of authority and personality. * * * I recognized
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>
even while in the hospital that one had to search for new
ideas conducive to reconstruction. I found them in Nationalism,
in the value of strength and power of individual personality.
* * * If one rejects pacifism, one must put a new
idea in its place immediately. Everything must be pushed
aside, must be replaced by something better. * * * We
must not forget that all the benefits of culture must be introduced
more or less with an iron fist just as once upon
a time the farmers were forced to plant potatoes.</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“With the very same courage with which we go to work to
make up for what had been sinned during the last 14 years,
we have withstood all attempts to move us off the right
way.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * We must first gain complete power if we want to
crush the other side completely. While still gaining power,
one should not start the struggle against the opponent. Only
when one knows that one has reached the pinnacle of power,
that there is no further possible development, shall one
strike. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Now we stand before the last election. Regardless
of the outcome there will be no retreat, even if the coming
election does not bring about a decision. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The question of restoration of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> will not be
decided at Geneva but in Germany, when we have gained
internal strength through internal peace.” (<span class='it'>D-203</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In reply to these statements Goering, who was present at that
same meeting, declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“That the sacrifice asked for surely would be much easier
for industry to bear if it realized that the election of March
5th will surely be the last one for the next ten years, probably
even for the next hundred years.” (<span class='it'>D-203</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a memorandum dated 22 February 1933, found in the personal
files of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, Krupp
briefly described this same meeting, and recalled that he had expressed
to Hitler the gratitude of the 25 industrialists present.
(<span class='it'>D-204</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In April 1933, after Hitler had entrenched himself in power,
Gustav Krupp, as Chairman of the Reich Association of German
Industry, which was the largest association of German industrialists,
submitted to Hitler the plan of that association for the
reorganization of German industry. In connection therewith
Krupp undertook to bring the association into line with the
aims of the conspirators, and to make it an effective instrument
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
for the execution of their policies. In a letter of transmittal
(<span class='it'>D-157</span>), Krupp stated that the plan of reorganization which
he submitted on behalf of the association of industrialists, was
characterized by the desire to coordinate economic measures and
political necessity, adopting the Fuehrer conception of the new
German state. In the plan of reorganization itself, Krupp
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The turn of political events is in line with the wishes which
I myself and the board of directors have cherished for a long
time. In reorganizing the Reich Association of German
Industry, I shall be guided by the idea of bringing the new
organization into agreement with the political aims of the
Reich Government.” (<span class='it'>D-157</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The ideas of Krupp were subsequently adopted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the decree introducing the leadership principle into industry,
each group of industry was required to have a leader who
was to serve without compensation. The leaders were to be
appointed and could be removed at the discretion of the Minister
of Economics. The charter of each group was to be created by
the leader, who was obligated to lead his group in accordance
with the principles of the National Socialist State (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
1934, Part I, 1194, Sec. 11, 12, 16). The introduction of the
leadership principle into the organizations of business centralized
authority and guaranteed the efficient execution of orders,
which the government issued to business, in the effort to promote
a war economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The overwhelming support given by the German industrialists
to the Nazi war program is described in a speech prepared by
Gustav Krupp in January 1944, for delivery at the University
of Berlin:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“War material is life-saving for one’s own people, and whoever
works and performs in those spheres can be proud of
it. Here, enterprise as a whole, finds its highest justification
of existence. This justification, I may inject this here,
crystallized especially during the time of interregnum between
1919 and 1933, when Germany was lying down disarmed.
* * *</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is the one great merit of the entire German war economy
that it did not remain idle during those bad years, even
though its activity could not be brought to light for obvious
reasons. Through years of secret work, scientific and basic
groundwork was laid in order to be ready again to work
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>
for the German armed forces at the appointed hour without
loss of time or experience.</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Only through the secret activity of German enterprise, together
with the experience gained meanwhile through production
of peacetime goods, was it possible, after 1933, to
fall into step with the new tasks arrived at, restoring Germany’s
military power. Only through all that could the
entirely new and various problems, brought up by the Fuehrer’s
Four-Year Plan for German enterprise, be mastered.
It was necessary to supply the new raw materials, to explore
and experiment, to invest capital in order to make German
economy independent and strong—in short, to make it war-worthy.</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I think I may state here that the German enterprises followed
the new ways enthusiastically, that they made the
great intentions of the Fuehrer their own by fair competition
and conscious gratitude, and became his faithful followers.
How else could the tasks between 1933 and 1939,
and especially those after 1939, have been overcome?” (<span class='it'>D-317</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>3. THE USE OF ECONOMIC MEASURES TO FACILITATE REARMAMENT</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It must be emphasized that the secret rearmament program
was launched immediately upon the seizure of power by the Nazi
conspirators. On 4 April 1933 the Reich Cabinet passed a resolution
establishing a Reich Defense Council. The function of this
council was secretly to mobilize for war. At the second meeting
of the working committee of the Councillors for Reich Defense,
the predecessor of the Reich Defense Council, which was held on
22 May 1933, the chairman was Keitel. Keitel stated that the
Reich Defense Council would immediately undertake to prepare
for war emergency. He stressed the urgency of the task of organizing
a war economy, and announced that the council stood
ready to brush aside all obstacles. Fully aware of the fact that
their action was in flagrant violation of the Treaty of Versailles,
Keitel emphasized the extreme importance of absolute secrecy:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“No document ought to be lost, since otherwise it may fall into
the hands of the enemies’ intelligence service. Orally transmitted,
matters are not provable; they can be denied by us
in Geneva.” (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The singleness of purpose with which the Nazi conspirators
geared the German economy to the forging of a war machine is
further shown by the secret minutes of the second meeting of the
working committee of the Reich Defense Council, held on 7 February
1934. At this meeting at which Capt. Schmundt, Col. Guerian,
Maj. Gen. von Reichenau, Maj. Warlimont, and Jodl—then
a Lt. Col.—were present, Lieutenant-General Beck pointed out
that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The actual state of preparation is the purpose of this session.”
(<span class='it'>EC-404</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Detailed measures of financing a future war were discussed and
it was pointed out that the financial aspects of the war economy
would be regulated by the Reich Finance Ministry and the Reichsbank,
which was headed by Schacht. (<span class='it'>EC-404</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under his secret appointment as Plenipotentiary-General of
the War Economy, Schacht had the express function of placing
all economic forces of the nation in the services of the Nazi war
machine. The secret defense law of 21 May 1935 in effect gave
Schacht charge of the entire war economy. In case of war he
was to be virtual economic dictator of Germany. His task was
to place all economic forces into service for the conduct of war and
to secure economically the life of the German people. The Ministers
of Economics, Food, Agriculture, Labor, and Forestry, as
well as all Reich agencies directly under the Fuehrer, were subordinated
to him. He was to be responsible for the financing as
well as for the conduct of the war; and he was further authorized
to issue ordinances within his sphere of responsibility, even if
these deviated from existing laws. (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rearmament of Germany proceeded at a rapid pace. By
summer of 1935 the Nazi conspirators were emboldened to make
plans for the reoccupation of the Rhineland, and at the tenth meeting
of the working committee of the council the question of measures
to be taken in connection with the proposed reoccupation of
the Rhineland was discussed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that meeting, on 26 June 1935, it was said that the Rhineland
required special treatment because of the assurances given by
Hitler to the French that no military action was being undertaken
in the demilitarized zone. Among the matters requiring special
treatment was the preparation of economic mobilization, a task
specifically entrusted to Schacht as secret Plenipotentiary for the
War Economy. In this connection it was stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Since political entanglements abroad must be
avoided at present under all circumstances, only these preparatory
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
measures that are urgently necessary may be carried
out. The existence of such preparations, or the intention
of them must be kept in strictest secrecy in the zone
itself as well as in the rest of the Reich.” (<span class='it'>EC-405</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Preparations of various types were thereupon discussed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rapid success of German rearmament is attributable to
the work of Schacht. In the fall of 1934, the Nazi conspirators
announced the “New Plan”, which aimed at the control of imports
and exports in order to obtain the raw materials needed for
armaments and the foreign currency required to sustain the armament
program. The “New Plan” was the creation of Schacht.
Under the plan, Schacht controlled imports by extending the
system of supervisory boards for import control, which was previously
limited to the main groups of raw materials, to all goods
imported into Germany. The requirement of licenses for imports
enabled the Nazi conspirators to restrict imports to those commodities
which served their war aims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Subsequently, in February 1935, the <span class='it'>Devisen</span> Law was passed
(<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> 1935, I, 105). Under it, all transactions involving
foreign exchange were subject to the approval of <span class='it'>Devisenstellen</span>
(Foreign Exchange Control Offices). By thus controlling
the disposition of foreign exchange, the conspirators were able
to manipulate foreign trade so as to serve their ends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every aspect of the German economy was geared to war under
the guidance of the Nazi conspirators, particularly Schacht. In
a study of the economic mobilization for war as of 30 September
1934, it was stated that steps had already been taken to build up
stock piles, to construct new facilities for the production of
scarce goods, to redeploy industry to secure areas, and to control
fiscal and trade policies. The task of stock piling, it was announced,
had been hampered by the requirement of secrecy and
camouflage. Reserves of automobile fuels and stocks of coal were
accumulated, and the production of synthetic oil was accelerated.
Civilian supply was purposely organized so that most plants
would be working for the German Armed Forces. Studies were
made of the possibility of barter trade with supposedly neutral
countries in case of war. (<span class='it'>EC-128</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Financing of the armament program presented a difficult problem
for the conspirators. In 1934 and 1935, the German economy
could by no possibility have raised funds for the Nazis’ extensive
rearmament program through taxes and public loans. From
the outset, the armament program involved “the engagement of
the last reserves.” Moreover, apart from the problem of raising
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
the huge sums required to sustain this program, the Nazi conspirators
were exceedingly anxious, in the early stages, to conceal
the extent of their armament activities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After considering various techniques of financing the armament
program, Schacht proposed the use of “mefo” bills. One
of the primary advantages of this method was the fact that
through its use figures indicating the extent of rearmament,
which would have become public through the use of other methods,
could be kept secret. “Mefo” bills were used exclusively for
armament financing. Transactions in “mefo” bills worked as follows:
“Mefo” bills were drawn by armament contractors and accepted
by a limited liability company. The spelling of the word
“mefo” is taken from the name of this company, <span class='it'>Metallurgische
Forschungsgesellschaft, m.b.h.</span> (<span class='it'>MEFO</span>). This company had a
nominal capital of one million Reichsmarks and was merely a
dummy organization. The bills were received by all German
banks for possible rediscounting with the Reichsbank. The bills
were guaranteed by the Reich. Their secrecy was assured by the
fact that they appeared neither in the published statements of
the Reichsbank nor in the budget figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “mefo” bill system continued to be used until 1 April 1938.
Up to that date 12 billion Reichsmarks of “mefo” bills for the
financing of rearmament had been issued. Since it was no longer
deemed necessary to conceal the vast progress of German rearmament,
“mefo” financing was discontinued at that time. (<span class='it'>EC-436</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further sources of funds upon which Schacht drew to finance
the secret armament program were the funds of political opponents
of the Nazi regime, and Marks of foreigners on deposit
in the Reichsbank. As Schacht boasted in a memorandum to Hitler
dated 3 May 1935:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Our armaments are also financed partly with the credits of
our political opponents.” (<span class='it'>1168-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The outstanding “mefo” bills represented at all times a threat
to the stability of the currency because they could be tendered to
the Reichsbank for discount, in which case the currency circulation
would automatically have to be increased. Thus, there was
an ever-present threat of inflation. Schacht nevertheless continued
on his course, because he stood with unswerving loyalty to
the Fuehrer, because he fully recognized the basic idea of National
Socialism, and because he felt that at the end, the disturbances,
compared to the great task, could be considered irrelevant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>High-ranking military officers paid tribute to Schacht’s contrivances
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>
on behalf of the Nazi war machine. An article written
for the “Military Weekly Gazette” in January 1937 stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Defense Force commemorates Dr. Schacht today
as one of the men who have done imperishable things
for it and its development in accordance with directions from
the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor. The defense force owes
it to Schacht’s skill and great ability that, in defiance of all
currency difficulties it, according to plan, has been able to
grow up to its present strength from an army of 100,000
men.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After the reoccupation of the Rhineland, the Nazi conspirators
redoubled their efforts to prepare Germany for a major war. The
Four Year Plan was proclaimed by Hitler in his address at the
Nurnberg Party Convention on 9 September 1936. It was given
a statutory foundation by the decree concerning the execution of
the Four Year Plan dated 18 October 1936 (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>
1936, I, 887). By this decree Goering was put in charge of the
plan. He was authorized to enact any legal and administrative
measures deemed necessary by him for the accomplishment of his
task, and to issue orders and instructions to all government agencies,
including the highest Reich authorities. The purpose of the
plan was to enable Nazi Germany to attain complete self-sufficiency
in essential raw materials, notably motor fuel, rubber, textile
fiber, and non-ferrous metals, and to intensify preparations
for war. The development of synthetic products was greatly accelerated
despite their high costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from the self-sufficiency program, however, the Nazi conspirators
required foreign exchange to finance propaganda and
espionage activities abroad. Thus, in a speech on 1 November
1937 before the <span class='it'>Wehrmachtakademie</span>, General Thomas stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If you consider that one will need during the war considerable
means in order to organize the necessary propaganda,
in order to pay for the espionage service, and for similar purposes,
then one should be clear that our internal Mark would
be of no use therefore, and that Foreign Exchange will be
needed.” (<span class='it'>EC-14</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This need for foreign exchange was reduced in part by virtue
of the espionage and propaganda services rendered free of charge
to the Nazi state by leading German industrial concerns. A memorandum
dated at Essen on 12 October 1935, which was found in
the files of the Krupp company, contains the subheading: “Concerns:—distribution
official propaganda literature abroad with
help of our foreign connections.” It goes on to say that on the
morning of 11 October the district representative of the Ribbentrop
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>
Private Foreign Office, <span class='it'>Dienststelle Ribbentrop</span>, made an appointment
by telephone with Mr. Lachman to arrive at an appointed
time. The memorandum continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In answer to my question, with whom I was dealing and
which official bureau he represented, he informed me that he
was not himself the district representative of Ribbentrop’s
Private Foreign Office, but that a Mr. Landrat Bollman was
such and that he himself had come at Mr. Bollman’s order.”
(<span class='it'>D-206</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>After discussing the confusion in the field of foreign propaganda,
the memorandum states that Ribbentrop’s Foreign Office is creating
a private organization for foreign propaganda, and that for
this purpose the support of the Krupp firm and especially an index
of addresses are needed. This request received the following
response:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I informed Mr. Lachman that our firm has put itself years
ago at the disposal of official bureaus for purposes of foreign
propaganda, and that we had supported all requests addressed
to us to the utmost.” (<span class='it'>D-206</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These activities are demonstrated by another document found
in the files of the Krupp company. A memorandum prefaced by
Herr Sonnenberg, on 14 October 1937, reports a meeting at Essen
on 12 October 1937. The government’s request for assistance in
foreign intelligence activities met this response:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On our part we undertook to supply information to the Combined
Services Ministry (R.K.M.) as required.” (<span class='it'>D-167</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the conspirators’ program of self-sufficiency was
proceeding with great speed. The production of steel, for example,
as shown in official German publication, rose as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>The production of gasoline increased at an even greater tempo:
from 387,000 tons in 1934 to 1,494,000 tons in 1938 (<span class='it'>Statistical
Yearbook of the German Reich, 1939-1942</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators pressed the completion of the armament
program with a sense of urgency betraying their awareness
of the imminence of war. At a meeting on 4 September 1936
Goering pointed out that “all measures have to be taken just as
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>
if we were actually in the state of imminent danger of war.” He
pointed out that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * if war should break out tomorrow we would be
forced to take measures from which we might possibly still
shy away at the present moment. They are therefore to be
taken.” (<span class='it'>EC-416</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The extreme urgency was manifested by Goering’s remark that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * existent reserves will have to be touched for the
purpose of carrying us over this difficulty until the goal ordered
by the Fuehrer has been reached; in case of war they
are not a reliable backing in any case.” (<span class='it'>EC-416</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht was advised by a top secret letter dated 31 August
1936 that Hitler ordered all formations of the air force to be ready
by 1 April 1937. (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>After their successes in Austria and the Sudetenland, the Nazi
conspirators redoubled their efforts to equip themselves for the
war of aggression which they planned to launch. In a conference
on 14 October 1938, shortly before the Nazis made their first demands
on Poland, Goering stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Everybody knows from the press what the world
situation looks like, and therefore the Fuehrer has issued an
order to him to carry out a gigantic program compared to
which previous achievements are insignificant. There are
difficulties in the way which he will overcome with the utmost
energy and ruthlessness.” (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The supply of foreign currency had sunken because of preparations
for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. Replenishment was considered
necessary. At the same conference, on 14 October 1938,
Goering declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“These gains made through the export are to be used for an
increased armament. The armament should not be curtailed
by export activities.” (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Goering had received the order from the Fuehrer to increase
armaments to an abnormal extent, the air force having first priority,
and interpreted it as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Within the shortest time, the air force should be increased
five fold; also the navy should create war weapons more rapidly,
and the army should produce large amounts of war
weapons at a faster rate, particularly heavy artillery and
heavy tanks. Along with this a larger production of armaments
must go, especially fuel, rubber, powders and explosives
must be moved to the foreground. This should be
coupled with an accelerated expansion of highways, canals,
and particularly of the railroads.” (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of these preparations for war, a clash of wills ensued
between Goering and Schacht, as a result of which Schacht
resigned his position as head of the Ministry of Economics and
Plenipotentiary for the War Economy in November 1937. He
was removed from the presidency of the Reichsbank in January
1939. Regardless of the details of this controversy, Schacht’s
departure in no way implied any disagreement with the major
war aims of the Nazis. Schacht took particular pride in his vast
attainments in the financial and economic fields in aid of the Nazi
war machine. In a letter to General Thomas Schacht wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I think back with much satisfaction to the work in the Ministry
of Economics which afforded me the opportunity to
assist in the rearmament of the German people in the most
critical period, not only in the financial but also in the economic
sphere. I have always considered a rearmament of the
German people as condition <span class='it'>sine qua non</span> of the establishment
of a new German nation.” (<span class='it'>EC-257</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter written to General Von Blomberg, on 8 July 1937,
Schacht wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The direction of the war economy by the plenipotentiary
would in that event never take place entirely independent
from the rest of the war mechanism but would be aimed at
accomplishment of the political war purpose with the assistance
of all economic forces. I am entirely willing, therefore,
to participate in this way in the preparation of the
forthcoming order giving effect to the Defense Act.” (<span class='it'>EC-252</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1937, Schacht participated with representatives
of the three branches of the armed forces in “war games
in war economy” at Godesberg. A report of these exercises, entitled
“War economy tasks in Godesberg undertaken by General
Staff between the 25th of May and the 2nd of June,” records the
speech welcoming Dr. Schacht:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Before I start with the discussion of the war game in war
economy, I have to express how grateful we all are that you,
President Dr. Schacht, have gone to the trouble personally
to participate in our final discussion today despite all your
other activities. This proves to us your deep interest in war
economy tasks shown at all times and your presence is renewed
proof that you are willing to facilitate for us soldiers
the difficult war-economic preparations and to strengthen
the harmonious cooperation with your offices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I want to point out, however, that all matters and all
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>
information received has to be kept in strictest secrecy
* * *.” (<span class='it'>EC-174</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The annexation of Austria was apparently a goal which
Schacht had long sought, for in a speech to the employees of the
former Austrian National Bank he declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Austria has certainly a great mission, namely, to
be the bearer of German culture, to insure respect and regard
for the German name, especially in the direction of the
southeast. Such a mission can only be performed within the
Great German Reich and based on the power of a nation of
75 millions, which, regardless of the wish of the opponents,
forms the heart and the soul of Europe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We have read a lot in the foreign press during the last few
days that this aim, the union of both countries, is to a certain
degree justified, but that the methods of effecting this union
was terrible. This method which certainly did not suit one
or the other power was nothing but the consequence of countless
perfidies and brutal acts and violence which foreign
countries have practiced against us * * *.”</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * I am known for sometimes expressing thoughts
which give offense and there I would not like to depart from
this consideration. I know that there are even in this country
a few people—I believe they are not too numerous—who
find fault with the events of the last few days, but nobody,
I believe, doubts the goal, and it should be said to all grumblers
that you can’t satisfy everybody. One person says he
would have done it maybe one way, but the remarkable thing
is that they did not do it, and that it was only done by our
Adolf Hitler; and if there is still something left to be improved,
then those grumblers should try to bring about these
improvements from the German Reich, and within the German
community, but not to disturb us from without.” (<span class='it'>EC-297-A</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A memorandum of 7 January 1939, written by Schacht and
other directors of the Reichsbank to Hitler, urged a balancing of
the budget in view of the threatening danger of inflation. The
memorandum continued:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * From the beginning the Reichsbank has been
aware of the fact that a successful foreign policy can be
attained only by the reconstruction of the German armed
forces. It [the Reichsbank] therefore assumed to a very
great extent the responsibility to finance the rearmament
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>
in spite of the inherent dangers to the currency. The justification
thereof was the necessity, which pushed all other
considerations into the background, to carry through the armament
at once, out of nothing, and furthermore under camouflage,
which made a respect-commanding foreign policy
possible.” (<span class='it'>EC-369</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Reichsbank directors, as experts on money, believed that
a point had been reached where greater production of armaments
was no longer possible. That was merely a judgment on the situation
and not a moral stand, for there was no opposition to Hitler’s
policy of aggression. Doubts were merely entertained as to
whether that policy could be financed. Hitler’s letter to Schacht
on the occasion of Schacht’s departure from the Reichsbank paid
high tribute to Schacht’s great efforts in furthering the program
of the Nazi conspirators. The armed forces by now had enabled
Hitler to take Austria and the Sudetenland. Hitler, in his letter
to Schacht declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Your name, above all, will always be connected with the first
epoch of national rearmament.” (<span class='it'>EC-397</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Even though dismissed from the presidency of the Reichsbank,
Schacht was retained as a minister without portfolio and
special confidential adviser to Hitler. Funk stepped into Schacht’s
position as president of the Reichsbank (<span class='it'>Voelkisher Beobachter</span>
of 21 January 1939). Funk was uninhibited by fears of inflation,
and like Goering, under whom he had served in the Four Year
Plan, he recognized no obstacles to the plan to attack Poland.
In a letter written on 25 August 1939, only a few days before
the attack on Poland, Funk reported to Hitler that the Reichsbank
was prepared to withstand any disturbances of the international
currency and credit system occasioned by a large-scale
war. He said that he had secretly transferred all available funds
of the Reichsbank abroad into gold, and that Germany stood ready
to meet the financial and economic tasks which lay ahead. (<span class='it'>699-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems clear that the Nazi conspirators directed the whole
of the German economy toward preparation for aggressive war.
To paraphrase the words of Goering, the conspirators gave the
German people “guns instead of butter.” They also gave history
its most striking example of a nation gearing itself in time of
peace to the single purpose of aggressive war. Their economic
preparations, formulated and applied with the energy of Goering,
the financial wizardry of Schacht, and the willing complicity of
Funk, among others, were the indispensable prerequisites for
their subsequent campaign of aggression.

<div><span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span><h1 id='pg370a'>Chapter IX<br/> LAUNCHING OF WARS OF AGGRESSION</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg370b'>I. THE PLOTTING OF AGGRESSIVE WAR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The aggressive war phase of the case against the Nazi conspirators
is, in the view of the American prosecution, the heart
of the case. Everything else in this case, however dramatic, however
sordid, however shocking and revolting to the common instinct
of civilized peoples, is incidental or subordinate to, the fact
of aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the dramatic story of what went on in Germany in the
early phases of the conspiracy—the ideologies used, the techniques
of terror used, the suppressions of human freedom employed in
the seizure of power, and even the concentration camps and the
crimes against humanity, the persecutions, tortures and murders
committed—all these things would have had little international
juridical significance except for the fact that they were the preparation
for the commission of aggressions against peaceful neighboring
peoples. Even the aspects of the case involving “war
crimes” in the strict sense are merely the inevitable, proximate
result of the wars of aggression launched and waged by these
conspirators, and of the kind of warfare they waged. It was
total war, the natural result of the totalitarian party-dominated
state that waged it; it was atrocious war, the natural result of the
doctrines, designs and purposes of the Nazi conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The substantive rule of law which is controlling on this part
of the case is stated in Article 6 of the Charter of the International
Military Tribunal, which, so far as is pertinent here, reads
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Article 6.</span> The Tribunal established by the Agreement referred
to in Article 1 hereof for the trial and punishment of
the major war criminals of the European Axis countries
shall have the power to try and punish persons who, acting
in the interests of the European Axis countries, either as
individuals or as members of organizations, committed any
of the following crimes.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The following acts, or any of them, are crimes coming
within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for which there shall
be individual responsibility:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(a) <span class='it'>Crimes against peace</span>: namely, planning, preparation,
initiation or waging of a war of aggression, or a war in violation
of international treaties, agreements or assurances,
or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment
of any of the foregoing * * *”
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices participating
in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy
to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible
for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such
plan.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Five important principles are contained in these portions of
the Charter:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Charter imposes “individual responsibility” for acts
constituting “crimes against peace”;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The term “Crimes against peace” embraces planning,
preparation, initiation, or waging of illegal war;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The term “Crimes against peace” also embraces participation
in a common plan or conspiracy to commit illegal war;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;An illegal war consists of either a war of aggression, or
a war in violation of international treaties, agreements, or assurances;
(these two kinds of illegal war might not necessarily
be the same; it will be sufficient for the prosecution to show either
that the war was aggressive irrespective of breach of international
treaties, agreements or assurances, or that the war was in
violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances irrespective
of whether or not it was a war of aggression; but the
American prosecution will undertake to establish that the wars
planned, prepared, initiated, and waged by the Nazi conspirators
were illegal for both reasons);</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual criminal responsibility of a defendant is imposed
by the Charter not merely by reasons of direct, immediate
participation in the crime. It is sufficient to show that a defendant
was a leader, an organizer, instigator, or accomplice who
participated either in the formulation or in the execution of a
common plan or conspiracy to commit crimes against peace. In
this connection, the Charter declares that the responsibility of
conspirators extends not only to their own acts but also to all acts
performed by any persons in execution of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is familiar law in the United States that if two or more persons
set out to rob a bank in accordance with a criminal scheme
to that end, and in the course of carrying out their scheme one of
the conspirators commits the crime of murder, all the participants
in the planning and execution of the bank robbery are
guilty of murder, whether or not they had any other personal
participation in the killing. This is a simple rule of law declared
in the Charter. All the parties to a common plan or conspiracy
are the agents of each other and each is responsible as principal
for the acts of all the others as his agents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The documentary evidence assembled on this aggressive war
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>
aspect of the case will show the following: (1) the conspiratorial
nature of the planning and preparation which underlay the Nazi
aggressions already known to history; (2) the deliberate premeditation
which preceded those acts of aggression; (3) the evil
motives which led to the attacks; (4) the individual participation
of named persons in the Nazi conspiracy for aggression; (5)
the deliberate falsification of the pretexts claimed by the Nazi
aggressors as they arose for their criminal activities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The critical period between the Nazi seizure of power and the
initiation of the first war of aggression was very short. This
critical period of illegal preparation and scheming, which ultimately
set the whole world aflame, covered 6 years, from 1933
to 1939. Crowded into these 6 short years is the making of
tragedy for mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A full understanding of these 6 years, and the 6 years of war
that followed, requires that this period be divided into phases
that reflect the development and execution of the Nazi master
plan. These phases may be said to be six. The first was primarily
preparatory, although it did involve overt acts. That phase covers
roughly the period from 1933 to 1936. In that period the
Nazi conspirators, having acquired government control of Germany
by the middle of 1933, turned their attention toward utilization
of that control for foreign aggression. Their plan at this
stage was to acquire military strength and political bargaining
power to be used against other nations. In this they succeeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second phase of their aggression was shorter. As the conspiracy
gained strength it gained speed. During each phase the
conspirators succeeded in accomplishing more and more in less
and less time until toward the end of the period, the rate of acceleration
of their conspiratorial movement was enormous. The
second phase of their utilization of control for foreign aggression
involved the actual seizure and absorption of Austria and
Czechoslovakia, in that order. By March 1939 they had succeeded
in this phase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third phase may be measured in months rather than years,
from March to September 1939. The previous aggression being
successful and having been consummated without the necessity
of resorting to actual war, the conspirators had obtained much
desired resources and bases and were ready to undertake further
aggressions by means of war, if necessary. By September 1939
war was upon the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth phase of the aggression consisted of expanding the
war into a general European war of aggression. By April 1941
the war which had theretofore involved Poland, the United Kingdom,
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>
and France, had been expanded by invasions into Scandinavia
and into the Low Countries and into the Balkans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the next phase the Nazi conspirators carried the war eastward
by invasion of the territory of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics. The sixth phase consisted of collaboration with
and instigation of their Pacific ally, Japan, and precipitated the
attack on the United States at Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The essential elements of the crime of aggressive war can be
made out by a mere handful of captured German documents.
These documents will leave no reasonable doubt concerning the
aggressive character of the Nazi war or concerning the conspiratorial
premeditation of that war. After the corpus of the
crime has been demonstrated in this way, the documentary evidence
will be discussed in subsequent sections, in a more or less
chronological and detailed presentation of the relevant activities
of the conspirators from 1933 to 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each of the ten documents which will be discussed in this section
has been selected to establish the basic facts concerning a
particular phase of the development of the Nazi conspiracy for
aggression. Each document has met three standards of selection:
each is conspiratorial in nature; each is believed to have been
hitherto unknown to history; and each is self-contained and tells
its own story.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>1933 to 1936.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The period of 1933 to 1936 was characterized by an orderly,
planned sequence of preparation for war. The essential objective
of this period was the formulation and execution of the plan
to rearm and re-occupy and fortify the Rhineland, in violation
of the treaty of Versailles and other treaties, in order to acquire
military strength and political bargaining powers to be used
against other nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A secret speech of Hitler’s delivered to all supreme commanders
on 23 November 1939, at 1200 hours, is sufficient to characterize
this phase of the Nazi conspiracy (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>). The report of
the speech was found in the OKW files captured at Flensberg.
Hitler spoke as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“November 23, 1939, 1200 hours. Conference with the
Fuehrer, to which all Supreme Commanders are ordered. The
Fuehrer gives the following speech:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The purpose of this conference is to give you an idea of
the world of my thoughts, which takes charge of me, in the
face of future events, and to tell you my decisions. The
building up of our armed forces was only possible in connection
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
with the ideological [<span class='it'>weltanschaulich</span>] education of
the German people by the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I started my political task in 1919, my strong belief
in final success was based on a thorough observation of
the events of the day and the study of the reasons for their
occurrence. Therefore, I never lost my belief in the midst
of setbacks which were not spared me during my period of
struggle. Providence has had the last word and brought me
success. On top of that, I had a clear recognition of the
probable course of historical events, and the firm will to
make brutal decisions. The first decision was in 1919 when
I after long internal conflict became a politician and took up
the struggle against my enemies. That was the hardest of
all decisions. I had, however, the firm belief that I would
arrive at my goal. First of all, I desired a new system of
selection. I wanted to educate a minority which would take
over the leadership. After 15 years I arrived at my goal,
after strenuous struggles and many setbacks. When I came
to power in 1933, a period of the most difficult struggle lay
behind me. Everything existing before that had collapsed.
I had to reorganize everything beginning with the mass of
the people and extending it to the armed forces. First reorganization
of the interior, abolishment of appearances of
decay and defeatist ideas, education to heroism. While reorganizing
the interior, I undertook the second task: to release
Germany from its international ties. Two particular
characteristics are to be pointed out: secession from the
League of Nations and denunciation of the disarmament
conference. It was a hard decision. The number of prophets
who predicted that it would lead to the occupation of the
Rhineland was large, the number of believers was very small.
I was supported by the nation, which stood firmly behind me,
when I carried out my intentions. After that the order for
rearmament. Here again there were numerous prophets
who predicted misfortunes, and only a few believers. In
1935 the introduction of compulsory armed service. After
that militarization of the Rhineland, again a process believed
to be impossible at that time. The number of people
who put trust in me was very small. Then beginning of the
fortification of the whole country especially in the west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One year later, Austria came. This step also was considered
doubtful. It brought about a considerable reinforcement
of the Reich. The next step was Bohemia, Moravia and
Poland. This step also was not possible to accomplish in one
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>
campaign. First of all, the western fortification had to be
finished. It was not possible to reach the goal in one effort.
It was clear to me from the first moment that I could not be
satisfied with the Sudeten-German territory. That was only
partial solution. The decision to march into Bohemia was
made. Then followed the erection of the Protectorate, and
with that basis for the action against Poland was laid, but
I wasn’t quite clear at that time whether I should start first
against the east and then in the west, or vice-versa”. (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There are some curious antitheses of thought in that, speech, as
in most of Adolf Hitler’s speeches. In one sentence he combines
guidance by providence with the making of “brutal decisions.”
He constantly speaks of how very few people were with him, and
yet the mass of the German people were with him. But he does
give a brief summary of this early period: the organization of the
mass of the people, the extension of organization to the armed
forces, and the various “brutal decisions” that were made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A top secret letter dated 24 June 1935, from General von Blomberg
to the Supreme Commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air
Forces demonstrates the preparations for war in which the Nazi
conspirators were engaged during this period. Attached to that
letter is a copy of a Secret Reich Defense law of 21 May 1935,
and a copy of a decision of the Reichcabinet of 21 May 1935 on
the Council for the Defense of the Reich (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>). These documents
were captured in the OKW files at Fechenheim. Von Blomberg’s
letter reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“In the appendix I transmit one copy each of the law for
the defense of the Reich of the 21 May 1935, and of a decision
of the Reich Cabinet of 21 May 1935 concerning the
Reich’s Defense Council. The publication of the Reich’s defense
law is temporarily suspended by order of the Fuehrer
and Reich Chancellor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Fuehrer and the Reichschancellor has nominated
the President of the directorate of the Reichsbank, Dr.
Schacht to be ‘Plenipotentiary-General for War economy’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I request that the copies of the Reich’s defense law needed
within the units of the armed forces be ordered before 1 July
1935 at armed forces office (L) where it is to be established
with the request that the law should only be distributed down
to Corps Headquarters outside of the Reichministry of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I point out the necessity of strictest secrecy once more.”
(<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Underneath von Blomberg’s signature is an indorsement, “Berlin,
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>
3 September 1935; No. 1820/35 L Top Secret II a. To Defense-Economic
Group G-3, copy transmitted (signed) Jodl.” (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Attached to this letter is the statute referred to as the Reich’s
Defense Law of 21 May 1935, enacted by the Reichscabinet. The
law covers in detail preparations for a state of defense, mobilization,
and appointment of the Plenipotentiary-General for War
Economy (Schacht) with plenipotentiary authority for the economic
preparation of the war. Part III provides for penalties.
The law is signed, “The Fuehrer and Reichschancellor, Adolf
Hitler; the Reichsminister of War, von Blomberg; the Reichsminister
of the Interior, Frick.” At the bottom of it there is this
note:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Note on the law for the defense of the Reich of 21 May
1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The publication of the law for the defense of the Reich
of 21 May 1935 will be suspended. The law became effective
21 May 1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Fuehrer and Reichschancellor, Adolf Hitler.” (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus, although the publication itself stated the law was made
public, and although the law became effective immediately, publication
was suspended by Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was also further attached to von Blomberg’s letter a copy
of the decision of the Reichscabinet of 21 May 1935 on the
Council for the Defense of the Realm. This decree deals largely
with organization for economic preparation for the war. This
law of May 1935 was the cornerstone of war preparations of the

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Formulation and Execution of Plans to Invade Austria and
Czechoslovakia.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The next phase of aggression was the formulation and execution
of plans to attack Austria and Czechoslovakia, in that order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most striking and revealing of all the captured documents
which have come to hand is one which has come to be known
as the Hossbach notes of a conference in the Reichs Chancellery
on 5 November 1937 from 1615 to 2030 hours (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). In the
course of that meeting Hitler outlined to those present the possibilities
and necessities of expanding their foreign policy, and requested,
“That his statements be looked upon in the case of his
death as his last will and testament.” The recorder of the minutes
of this meeting, Colonel Hossbach, was the Fuehrer’s adjutant.
Present at this conspiratorial meeting, among others, were Erich
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>
Raeder, Constantin von Neurath, and Hermann Wilhelm Goering.
The minutes of this meeting reveal a crystalization towards the
end of 1937 in the policy of the Nazi regime (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). Austria
and Czechoslovakia were to be acquired by force. They would
provide “<span class='it'>lebensraum</span>” (living space) and improve Germany’s
military position for further operations. While it is true that
actual events unfolded themselves in a somewhat different manner
than that outlined at this meeting, in essence the purposes
stated at the meeting were carried out. These notes, which destroy
any possible doubt concerning the Nazi’s premeditation of
their crimes against peace, read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Berlin, 10 November 1937. Notes on the conference in the
Reichskanzlei on 5 November 1937 from 1615 to 2030 hours.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Present: The Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsminister for War, Generalfeldmarschall v. Blomberg;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The C-in-C Army, Generaloberst Freiherr v. Fritsch;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The C-in-C Navy, Generaladmiral Dr. h.c. Raeder;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The C-in-C Luftwaffe, Generaloberst Goering;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs, Freiherr v. Neurath;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Oberst Hossbach [the adjutant who took the minutes].</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer stated initially that the subject matter of today’s
conference was of such high importance, that its detailed
discussion would certainly in other states take place
before the Cabinet in full session. However, he, the Fuehrer,
had decided not to discuss this matter in the larger circle of
the Reich Cabinet, because of its importance. His subsequent
statements were the result of detailed deliberations and
of the experiences of his four and a half years in government;
he desired to explain to those present his fundamental
ideas on the possibilities and necessities of expanding our
foreign policy and in the interests of a far-sighted policy he
requested that his statements be looked upon in the case of
his death as his last will and testament.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer then stated: The aim of German policy is the
security and the preservation of the nation and its propagation.
This is consequently a problem of space. The German
nation comprises eighty-five million people, which, because of
the number of individuals and the compactness of habitation
form a homogeneous European racial body, the like of
which can not be found in any other country. On the other
hand it justifies the demand for larger living space more than
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>
for any other nation. If there have been no political consequences
to meet the demands of this racial body for living
space then that is the result of historical development spread
over several centuries and should this political condition continue
to exist, it will represent the greatest danger to the
preservation of the German nation at its present high level.
An arrest of the deterioration of the German element in Austria
and in Czechoslovakia is just as little possible as the
preservation of the present state in Germany itself.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Instead of growth, sterility will be introduced, and as a
consequence, tensions of a social nature will appear after a
number of years, because political and philosophical ideas are
of a permanent nature only as long as they are able to produce
the basis for the realization of the actual claim of existence
of a nation. The German future is therefore dependent
exclusively on the solution of the need for living space. Such
a solution can be sought naturally only for a limited period,
about one to three generations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Before touching upon the question of solving the need for
living space, it must be decided whether a solution of the
German position with a good future can be attained, either
by way of an autarchy or by way of an increased share in
universal commerce and industry.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Autarchy: Execution will be possible only with strict National-Socialist
State policy, which is the basis; assuming this
can be achieved the results are as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. In the sphere of raw materials, only limited, but not
total autarchy can be attained:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Wherever coal can be used for the extraction of raw
materials autarchy is feasible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. In the case of ores the position is much more difficult.
Requirements in iron and light metals can be covered by ourselves.
Copper and tin, however, can not.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Cellular materials can be covered by ourselves as long
as sufficient wood supplies exist. A permanent solution is not
possible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. Edible fats—possible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“B. In the case of foods, the question of an autarchy must
be answered with a definite NO.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The general increase of living standards, compared with
thirty to forty years ago, brought about a simultaneous increase
of the demand and an increase of personal consumption
even among the producers, the farmers, themselves.
The proceeds from the production increase in agriculture
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>
have been used for covering the increased demand, therefore
they represent no absolute increase in production. A
further increase in production by making greater demands
on the soil is not possible because it already shows signs of
deterioration due to the use of artificial fertilizers, and it is
therefore certain that, even with the greatest possible increase
in production, participation in the world market could
not be avoided.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The considerable expenditure of foreign currency to secure
food by import, even in periods when harvests are good, increases
catastrophically when the harvest is really poor.
The possibility of this catastrophe increases correspondingly
to the increase in population, and the annual 560,000 excess
in births would bring about an increased consumption in
bread, because the child is a greater bread eater than the
adult.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Permanently to counter the difficulties of food supplies by
lowering the standard of living and by rationing is impossible
in a continent which had developed an approximately
equivalent standard of living. As the solving of the unemployment
problem has brought into effect the complete power
of consumption, some small corrections in our agricultural
home production will be possible, but not a wholesale alteration
of the standard of food consumption. Consequently
autarchy becomes impossible, specifically in the sphere of
food supplies as well as generally.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Participation in world economy. There are limits to this
which we are unable to transgress. The market fluctuations
would be an obstacle to a secure foundation of the German
position; international commercial agreements do not offer
any guarantee for practical execution. It must be considered
on principle that since the World War (1914-18), as industrialization
has taken place in countries which formerly exported
food. We live in a period of economic empires, in
which the tendency to colonies again approaches the condition
which originally motivated colonization; in Japan and
Italy economic motives are the basis of their will to expand,
and economic need will also drive Germany to it. Countries
outside the great economic empires have special difficulties
in expanding economically.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The upward tendency, which has been caused in world
economy, due to armament competition, can never form a
permanent basis for an economic settlement, and this latter
is also hampered by the economic disruption caused by Bolshevism.
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>
There is a pronounced military weakness in those
states who base their existence on export. As our exports
and imports are carried out over those sea lanes which are
dominated by Britain, it is more a question of security of
transport than one of foreign currency, and this explains
the great weakness in our food situation in wartime. The
only way out, and one which may appear imaginary, is the
securing of greater living space, an endeavor which at all
times has been the cause of the formation of states and of
movements of nations. It is explicable that this tendency
finds no interest in Geneva and in satisfied states. Should
the security of our food situation be our foremost thought,
then the space required for this can only be sought in Europe,
but we will not copy liberal capitalist policies which rely on
exploiting colonies. It is not a case of conquering people,
but of conquering agriculturally useful space. It would also
be more to the purpose to seek raw material-producing territory
in Europe directly adjoining the Reich and not overseas,
and this solution would have to be brought into effect
for one or two generations. What would be required at a
later date over and above this must be left to subsequent,
generations. The development of great worldwide national
bodies is naturally a slow process and the German people,
with its strong racial root [Volksstamm] has for this purpose
the most favorable foundations in the heart of the European
Continent. The history of all times—Roman Empire,
British Empire—has proved that every space expansion can
only be effected by breaking resistance and taking risks.
Even setbacks are unavoidable; neither formerly nor today
has space been found without an owner; the attacker always
comes up against the proprietor.” (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After this somewhat jumbled discussion of geopolitical economic
theory and of the need for expansion and “<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>”,
Adolf Hitler, in these Hossbach notes, posed a question and proceeded
to answer it:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The question for Germany is where the greatest possible
conquest could be made at lowest cost.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“German politics must reckon with its two hateful enemies,
England and France, to whom a strong German colossus in
the center of Europe would be intolerable. Both these states
would oppose a further reinforcement of Germany, both in
Europe and overseas, and in this opposition they would have
the support of all parties. Both countries would view the
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>
building of German military strong points overseas as a
threat to their overseas communications, as a security measure
for German commerce, and retrospectively a strengthening
of the German position in Europe.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“England is not in a position to cede any of her colonial
possessions to us owing to the resistance which she experiences
in the Dominions. After the loss of prestige which
England has suffered owing to the transfer of Abyssinia to
Italian ownership, a return of East Africa can no longer be
expected. Any resistance on England’s part would at best
consist in the readiness to satisfy our colonial claims by taking
away colonies which at the present moment are not in
British hands, for example, Angola. French favors would
probably be of the same nature.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A serious discussion regarding the return of colonies to us
could be considered only at a time when England is in a state
of emergency and the German Reich is strong and well
armed. The Fuehrer does not share the opinion that the Empire
is unshakeable.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Resistance against the Empire is to be found less in conquered
territories than amongst its competitors. The British
Empire and the Roman Empire cannot be compared with
one another in regard to durability; after the Punic Wars
the latter did not have a serious political enemy. Only the
dissolving effects which originated in Christendom, and the
signs of age which creep into all states, made it possible for
the Ancient Germans to subjugate Ancient Rome.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Alongside the British Empire today a number of States
exist which are stronger than it. The British Mother Country
is able to defend its colonial possession only allied with
other states and not by its own power. How could England
alone, for example, defend Canada against attack by America,
or its Far Eastern interests against an attack by Japan?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The singling out of the British Crown as the bearer of Empire
unity is in itself an admission that the universal empire
cannot be maintained permanently by power politics. The
following are significant pointers in this respect:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Ireland’s struggle for independence.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Constitutional disputes in India where England, by
her half measures, left the door open for Indians at a later
date to utilize the non-fulfillment of constitutional promises
as a weapon against Britain.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The weakening of the British position in the Far East
by Japan.
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition in the Mediterranean to Italy which—by
virtue of its history, driven by necessity and led by a
genius—expands its power position and must consequently
infringe British interests to an increasing extent. The outcome
of the Abyssinian War is a loss of prestige for Britain
which Italy is endeavoring to increase by stirring up discontent
in the Mohammedan World.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It must be established in conclusion that the Empire cannot
be held permanently by power politics by 45 million Britons,
in spite of all the solidity of her ideals. The proportion of
the populations in the Empire, compared with that of the
Motherland, is nine to one, and it should act as a warning to
us that if we expand in space, we must not allow the level of
our population to become too low.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“France’s position is more favorable than that of England.
The French Empire is better placed geographically, the population
of its colonial possessions represents a potential military
increase. But France is faced with difficulties of internal
politics. At the present time only 10 per cent approximately
of the nations have parliamentary governments,
whereas 90 per cent of them have totalitarian governments.
Nevertheless, we have to take the following into our political
consideration as power factors:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Britain, France, Russia and the adjoining smaller states.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The German question can be solved only by way of force,
and this is never without risk. The battles of Frederick the
Great for Silesia, and Bismarck’s wars against Austria and
France had been a tremendous risk and the speed of Prussian
action in 1870 had prevented Austria from participating in
the war. If we place the decision to apply force with risk at
the head of the following expositions, then we are left to reply
to the questions ‘when’ and ‘how’. In this regard we have
to decide upon three different cases.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Case 1. Period 1943-45: After this we can only expect a
change for the worse. The rearming of the Army, the Navy
and the Air Force, as well as the formation of the Officers’
Corps, are practically concluded.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Our material equipment and armaments are modern; with
further delay the danger of their becoming out-of-date will
increase. In particular the secrecy of ‘special weapons’ cannot
always be safeguarded. Enlistment of reserves would be
limited to the current recruiting age groups and an addition
from older untrained groups would be no longer available.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In comparison with the rearmament, which will have been
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>
carried out at the time by other nations, we shall decrease in
relative power. Should we not act until 1943-45, then, dependent
on the absence of reserves, any year could bring
about the food crisis, for the countering of which we do not
possess the necessary foreign currency. This must be considered
as a ‘point of weakness in the regime.’ Over and
above that, the world will anticipate our action and will increase
counter-measures yearly. Whilst other nations isolate
themselves we should be forced on the offensive.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“What the actual position would be in the years 1943-45 no
one knows today. It is certain, however, that we can wait
no longer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On the one side the large armed forces, with the necessity
for securing their upkeep, the aging of the Nazi movement
and of its leaders, and on the other side the prospect of a
lowering of the standard of living and a drop in the birth
rate, leaves us no other choice but to act. If the Fuehrer is
still living, then it will be his irrevocable decision to solve
the German space problem no later than 1943-45. The necessity
for action before 1943-45 will come under consideration
in cases 2 and 3.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Case 2. Should the social tensions in France lead to an internal
political crisis of such dimensions that it absorbs the
French Army and thus renders it incapable for employment
in war against Germany, then the time for action against
Czechoslovakia has come.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Case 3. It would be equally possible to act against Czechoslovakia
if France should be so tied up by a war against another
State that it cannot ‘proceed’ against Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For the improvement of our military political position it
must be our first aim, in every case of entanglement by war,
to conquer Czechoslovakia and Austria, simultaneously, in
order to remove any threat from the flanks in case of a possible
advance Westwards. In the case of a conflict with
France it would hardly be necessary to assume that Czechoslovakia
would declare war on the same day as France. However,
Czechoslovakia’s desire to participate in the war will
increase proportionally to the degree to which we are being
weakened. Its actual participation could make itself felt by
an attack on Silesia, either towards the North or the West.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Once Czechoslovakia is conquered—and a mutual frontier,
Germany-Hungary is obtained—then a neutral attitude by
Poland in a German-French conflict could more easily be relied
upon. Our agreements with Poland remain valid only
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>
as long as Germany’s strength remains unshakeable; should
Germany have any setbacks then an attack by Poland against
East Prussia, perhaps also against Pomerania, and Silesia,
must be taken into account.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Assuming a development of the situation, which would lead
to a planned attack on our part in the years 1943 to ’45, then
the behaviour of France, England, Poland and Russia would
probably have to be judged in the following manner.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer believes personally, that in all probability
England and perhaps also France, have already silently
written off Czechoslovakia, and that they have got used to
the idea that this question would one day be cleaned up by
Germany. The difficulties in the British Empire and the
prospect of being entangled in another long-drawn-out European
War, were decisive factors in the nonparticipation of
England in a war against Germany. The British attitude
would certainly not remain without influence on France’s
attitude. An attack by France, without British support, is
hardly probable assuming that its offensive would stagnate
along our Western fortifications. Without England’s support,
it would also not be necessary to take into consideration
a march by France through Belgium and Holland, and
this would also not have to be reckoned with by us in case
of a conflict with France, as in every case it would have as
a consequence, the enmity of Great Britain. Naturally we
should in every case, have to bar our frontier during the
operation of our attacks against Czechoslovakia and Austria.
It must be taken into consideration here that Czechoslovakia’s
defence measures will increase in strength from year
to year, and that a consolidation of the inside values of the
Austrian Army will also be effected in the course of years.
Although the population of Czechoslovakia, in the first place
is not a thin one, the embodiment of Czechoslovakia and Austria
would nevertheless constitute the conquest of food for
five to six million people, on the basis that a compulsory emigration
of two million from Czechoslovakia, and of one million
from Austria could be carried out. The annexation of
the two States to Germany, militarily and politically, would
constitute a considerable relief, owing to shorter and better
frontiers, the freeing of fighting personnel for other purposes,
and the possibility of reconstituting new armies up
to a strength of about twelve Divisions, representing a new
Division per one million population.
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“No opposition to the removal of Czechoslovakia is expected
on the part of Italy; however, it cannot be judged today
what would be her attitude in the Austrian question, since
it would depend largely on whether the Duce were alive at
the time or not.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The measure and speed of our action would decide Poland’s
attitude. Poland will have little inclination to enter the war
against a victorious Germany, with Russia in the rear.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Military participation by Russia must be countered by the
speed of our operations; it is a question whether this needs
to be taken into consideration at all, in view of Japan’s attitude.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Should Case 2 occur—paralyzation of France by a Civil
War—then the situation should be utilized <span class='it'>at any time</span> for
operations against Czechoslovakia, as Germany’s most dangerous
enemy would be eliminated.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer sees Case 3 looming near; it could develop
from the existing tensions in the Mediterranean, and should
it occur, he has firmly decided to make use of it any time,
perhaps even as early as 1938.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Following recent experiences in the course of events of the
war in Spain, the Fuehrer does not see an early end to hostilities
there. Taking into consideration the time required
for past offensives by Franco, a further three years duration
of war is within the bounds of possibility. On the other
hand, from the German point of view, a one hundred per
cent victory by Franco is not desirable; we are more interested
in a continuation of the war and preservation of
the tensions in the Mediterranean. Should Franco be in sole
possession of the Spanish Peninsula, it would mean the end
of Italian intervention and the presence of Italy on the Balearic
Isles. As our interests are directed towards continuing
the war in Spain, it must be the task of our future policy
to strengthen Italy in her fight to hold on to the Balearic
Isles. However, a solidification of Italian positions on the
Balearic Isles can not be tolerated either by France or by
England and could lead to a war by France and England
against Italy, in which case Spain, if entirely in white
[Franco’s] hands, could participate on the side of Italy’s enemies.
A subjugation of Italy in such a war appears very
unlikely. Additional raw materials could be brought to Italy
via Germany. The Fuehrer believes that Italy’s military
strategy would be to remain on the defensive against France
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>
on the Western frontier and carry out operations against
France from Libya, against the North African French colonial
possessions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As a landing of French-British troops on the Italian coast
can be discounted, and as a French offensive via the Alps to
Upper Italy would be extremely difficult, and would probably
stagnate before the strong Italian fortifications, French lines
of communication by the Italian fleet will to a great extent
paralyze the transport of fighting personnel from North
Africa to France, so that at its frontiers with Italy and Germany,
France will have, at its disposal, solely the metropolitan
fighting forces.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If Germany profits from this war by disposing of the
Czechoslovakian and the Austrian questions, the probability
must be assumed that England—being at war with Italy—would
not decide to commence operations against Germany.
Without British support, a warlike action by France against
Germany is not to be anticipated.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The date of our attack on Czechoslovakia and Austria must
be made independent of the course of the Italian-French-English
war and would not be simultaneous with the commencement
of military operations by these three States. The
Fuehrer was also not thinking of military agreements with
Italy, but in complete independence and by exploiting this
unique favorable opportunity, he wishes to begin to carry
out operations against Czechoslovakia. The attack on Czechoslovakia
would have to take place with the speed of lightning
[<span class='it'>blitzartig schnell</span>].</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Fieldmarshal von Blomberg and Generaloberst von Fritsch
in giving their estimate on the situation, repeatedly pointed
out that England and France must not appear as our enemies,
and they stated that the war with Italy would not
bind the French Army to such an extent that it would not
be in a position to commence operations on our Western
frontier with superior forces. Generaloberst von Fritsch estimated
the French forces which would presumably be employed
on the Alpine frontier against Italy to be in the region
of twenty divisions, so that a strong French superiority
would still remain on our Western frontier. The French
would, according to German reasoning, attempt to advance
into the Rhineland. We should consider the lead which
France has got in mobilization, and quite apart from the
very small value of our then existing fortifications—which
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span>
was pointed out particularly by Generalfieldmarshal von
Blomberg—the four motorized divisions which had been laid
down for the West would be more or less incapable of movement.
With regard to our offensive in a Southeasterly direction,
Fieldmarshal von Blomberg drew special attention
to the strength of the Czechoslovakian fortifications, the
building of which had, assumed the character of a Maginot
Line and which would present extreme difficulties to our
attack.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Generaloberst von Fritsch mentioned that it was the purpose
of a study which he had laid on for this winter to investigate
the possibilities of carrying out operations against
Czechoslovakia with special consideration of the conquest of
the Czechoslovakian system of fortifications; the Generaloberst
also stated that owing to the prevailing conditions, he
would have to relinquish his leave abroad, which was to begin
on the 10 November. This intention was countermanded by
the Fuehrer, who gave as a reason that the possibility of the
conflict was not to be regarded as being so imminent. In reply
to statements by Generalfieldmarshal von Blomberg and
Generaloberst von Fritsch regarding England and France’s
attitude, the Fuehrer repeated his previous statements and
said that he was convinced of Britain’s nonparticipation and
that consequently he did not believe in military action by
France against Germany. Should the Mediterranean conflict
already mentioned, lead to a general mobilization in
Europe, then we should have to commence operations against
Czechoslovakia immediately. If, however, the powers who
are not participating in the war should declare their disinterestedness,
then Germany would, for the time being, have
to side with this attitude.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of the information given by the Fuehrer, Generaloberst
Goering considered it imperative to think of a reduction
or abandonment of our military undertaking in Spain.
The Fuehrer agreed to this, insofar as he believed this decision
should be postponed for a suitable date.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The second part of the discussion concerned material armament
questions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(Signed) Hossbach”. (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The record of what happened thereafter is well-known to history.
The Anschluss with Austria, under military pressure from
the Nazis, occurred in March 1938. Pressure on Czechoslovakia
resulted in the Munich Pact of September 1938. That Pact was
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>
violated, and Czechoslovakia invaded by Germany on 15 March
1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another captured document, a file kept by Colonel Schmundt,
Hitler’s adjutant, reveals the truth concerning the deliberateness
of the aggressions against Czechoslovakia (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>). The file
was found in a cellar of the Platterhof at Obersalzberg, near
Berchtesgaden. It consists of a work-file of originals and duplicates,
incidental to the preparations for the annexation of Czechoslovakia.
The German title is “<span class='it'>Grundlagen zur Studie Gruen</span>”,
(Basic Principles for “Case Green”), “Green” being a codeword
for the aggression against Czechoslovakia. Item No. 2 in this file
is dated 22 April 1938. It is a summary, prepared by Schmundt,
the adjutant, of a discussion on 21 April 1938 between Hitler
and Wilhelm Keitel. This item, like the other items in the file,
relates to “Case Green”. This meeting occurred within approximately
one month following the successful annexation of Austria.
In the carrying out of the conspiracy, it became necessary
to revise the “Plan Green”, to take into account changed conditions,
as a result of the bloodless success against Austria. Item
2 reads:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Bases of the Dissertation on <span class='it'>Gruen</span>.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Summary of discussion between Fuehrer and General Keitel
of 21 April:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A.&nbsp;&nbsp;Political Aspect.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Strategic surprise attack out of a clear sky without any
cause or possibility of justification has been turned down.
As result would be: hostile world opinion which can lead to
a critical situation. Such a measure is justified only for the
elimination of the <span class='it'>last</span> opponent on the mainland.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Action after a time of diplomatic clashes, which gradually
come to a crisis and lead to war.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning-swift action as the result of an incident (for
example, assassination of German ambassador in connection
with an anti-German demonstration.)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Military Conclusions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparations are to be made for the political possibilities
(2 and 3). Case 2 is the undesired one since “<span class='it'>Gruen</span>”
will have taken security measures.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of time caused by transporting the bulk of the
divisions by rail—which is unavailable, but should be cut
down as far as possible—must not impede a lightning-swift
blow at the time of the action.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Separate thrusts’ are to be carried out immediately
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span>
with a view to penetrating the enemy fortification lines at
numerous points and in a strategically favorable direction.
The thrusts are to be worked out to the smallest detail
(knowledge of roads, composition of the columns according
to their individual tasks). Simultaneous attacks by the
Army and Air Force.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Air Force is to support the individual columns (for example
divebombers; sealing off installations at penetration
points, hampering the bringing up of reserves, destroying
signal communications traffic, thereby isolating the garrisons.)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Politically, the first four days of military action are the
decisive ones. If there are no effective military successes, a
European crisis will certainly arise. Accomplished Facts
must prove the senselessness of foreign military intervention,
draw Allies into the scheme (division of spoils) and demoralize
‘<span class='it'>Gruen</span>.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore: bridging the time gap between first penetration
and employment of the forces to be brought up, by a determined
and ruthless thrust by a motorized army. (e.g. via
Pilsen, Prague.)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“5.&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible, separation of transport movement ‘<span class='it'>Rot</span>’ from
‘<span class='it'>Gruen</span>’. [‘<span class='it'>Rot</span>’ was the code name for their then plan against
the West.] A simultaneous strategic concentration ‘<span class='it'>Rot</span>’ can
lead ‘<span class='it'>Rot</span>’ to undesired measures. On the other hand, it
must be possible to put ‘<span class='it'>Case Rot</span>’ into operation at any time.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Propaganda.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaflets on the conduct of Germans in Czechoslovakia
(<span class='it'>Gruenland</span>.)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaflets with threats for intimidation of the Czechs
(<span class='it'>Gruenen</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Particular attention should be drawn to paragraph 3 of this
document, under the heading “Political Aspect”, which reads as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Lightning-swift action as the result of an incident (example:
Assassination of German ambassador as an upshot
of an anti-German demonstration).” (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The document as a whole establishes that the conspirators were
planning the creation of an incident to justify to the world their
own aggression against Czechoslovakia. It establishes that consideration
was being given to assassinating the German ambassador
at Prague to create the requisite incident.

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Formulation and Execution of the Plan to Invade Poland.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The next phase of the aggression was the formulation and execution
of the plan to attack Poland, resulting in the initiation of
aggressive war in September 1939. Here again the careful and
meticulous record keeping of Hitler’s adjutant, Schmundt, has
provided a document in his own handwriting which throws down
the mask (<span class='it'>L-79</span>). The document consists of minutes of a conference
held on 23 May 1939. The place of the conference was the
Fuehrer’s Study in the New Reich Chancellery. Goering, Raeder
and Keitel were present. The subject of the meeting was, “Indoctrination
on the political situation and future aims.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The authenticity and accuracy of Schmundt’s record of the
meeting of 23 May 1939 has been admitted by Keitel in a pretrial
interrogation. The minutes read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Top Secret</p>

<p class='noindent'>“To be transmitted by officer only</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Minutes of a Conference on 23 May 39”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Place: The Fuehrer’s Study, New Reich Chancellery.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Adjutant on duty: Lt-Col. (G.S.) Schmundt.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Present: The Fuehrer, Field-Marshal Goering, Grand-Admiral
Raeder, Col-Gen. von Brauchitsch, Col-Gen. Keitel,
Col-Gen. Milch, Gen. (of Artillery) Halder, Gen. Bodenschatz,
Rear-Adml. Schniewindt, Col. (G.S.) Jeschonnek,
Col. (G.S.) Warlimont, Lt-Col. (G.S.) Schmundt, Capt. Engel
(Army), Lieut-Commd. Albrecht, Capt. v. Below (Army).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Indoctrination on the political situation and future
aims.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer defined as the purpose of the conference:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Analysis of the situation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Definition of the tasks for the Armed Forces arising
from the situation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Exposition of the consequences of those tasks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. Ensuring the secrecy of all decisions and work resulting
from these consequences.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Secrecy is the first essential for success.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer’s observations are given in systematized form
below.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Our present situation must be considered from two points
of view:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The actual development of events between 1933 and
1939;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The permanent and unchanging situation in which Germany
lies.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the period 1933-1939, progress was made in all fields.
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Our military situation improved enormously.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Our situation with regard to the rest of the world has remained
the same.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany had dropped from the circle of Great Powers. The
balance of power had been effected without the participation
of Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This equilibrium is disturbed when Germany’s demands for
the necessities of life make themselves felt, and Germany re-emerges
as a Great Power. All demands are regarded as
‘Encroachments’. The English are more afraid of dangers
in the economic sphere than of the simple threat of force.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A mass of 80 million people has solved the ideological problems.
So, too, must the economic problems be solved. No
German can evade the creation of the necessary economic
conditions for this. The solution of the problems demands
courage. The principle, by which one evades solving the
problem by adapting oneself to circumstances, is inadmissible.
Circumstances must rather be adapted to aims. This
is impossible without invasion of foreign states or attacks
upon foreign property.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Living space, in proportion to the magnitude of the state,
is the basis of all power. One may refuse for a time to face
the problem, but finally it is solved one way or the other.
The choice is between advancement or decline. In 15 or 20
years’ time we shall be compelled to find a solution. No German
statesman can evade the question longer than that.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We are at present in a state of patriotic fervour, which is
shared by two other nations: Italy and Japan.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The period which lies behind us has indeed been put to
good use. All measures have been taken in the correct sequence
and in harmony with our aims.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“After 6 years, the situation is today as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The national-political unity of the Germans has been
achieved, apart from minor exceptions. Further successes
cannot be attained without the shedding of blood.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The demarcation of frontiers is of military importance.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Pole is no ‘supplementary enemy’. Poland will always
be on the side of our adversaries. In spite of treaties of
friendship, Poland has always had the secret intention of
exploiting every opportunity to do us harm.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Danzig is not the subject of the dispute at all. It is a question
of expanding our living space in the East and of securing
our food supplies, of the settlement of the Baltic problem.
Food supplies can be expected only from thinly populated
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>
areas. Over and above the natural fertility, thorough-going
German exploitation will enormously increase the surplus.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“There is no other possibility for Europe.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Colonies: Beware of gifts of colonial territory. This does
not solve the food problem. Remember—blockade.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If fate brings us into conflict with the West, the possession
of extensive areas in the East will be advantageous. Upon
record harvests we shall be able to rely even less in time of
war than in peace.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The population of non-German areas will perform no military
service, and will be available as a source of labour.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Polish problem is inseparable from conflict with the
West.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Poland’s internal power of resistance to Bolshevism is
doubtful. Thus Poland is of doubtful value as a barrier
against Russia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is questionable whether military success in the West can
be achieved by a quick decision, questionable too is the attitude
of Poland.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Polish government will not resist pressure from Russia.
Poland sees danger in a German victory in the West,
and will attempt to rob us of the victory.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“There is therefore no question of sparing Poland, and we
are left with the decision:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>To attack Poland at the first suitable opportunity.</span> [This
sentence is underscored in the original German text.]</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We cannot expect a repetition of the Czech affair. There
will be war. Our task is to isolate Poland. The success of
the isolation will be decisive.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore, the Fuehrer must reserve the right to give the
final order to attack. There must be no simultaneous conflict
with the Western Powers [France and England].</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If it is not certain that a German-Polish conflict will not
lead to war in the West, then the fight must be primarily
against England and France.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Fundamentally therefore: Conflict with Poland—beginning
with an attack on Poland—will only be successful if the
Western Powers keep out of it. If this is impossible, then
it will be better to attack in the West and to settle Poland
at the same time.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The isolation of Poland is a matter of skillful politics.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Japan is a weighty problem. Even if at first for various
reasons her collaboration with us appears to be somewhat
<span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>
cool and restricted, it is nevertheless in Japan’s own interest
to take the initiative in attacking Russia in good time.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Economic relations with Russia are possible only if political
relations have improved. A cautious trend is apparent in
Press comment. It is not impossible that Russia will show
herself to be disinterested in the destruction of Poland.
Should Russia take steps to oppose us, our relations with
Japan may become closer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If there were an alliance of France, England and Russia
against Germany, Italy and Japan, I would be constrained to
attack England and France with a few annihilating blows.
The Fuehrer doubts the possibility of a peaceful settlement
with England. We must prepare ourselves for the conflict.
England sees in our development the foundation of a hegemony
which would weaken England. England is therefore
our enemy, and the conflict with England will be a life-and-death
struggle.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>What will this struggle be like?</span> [This sentence is underscored
in the German original.]</p>

<p class='noindent'>“England cannot deal with Germany and subjugate us with
a few powerful blows. It is imperative for England that the
war should be brought as near to the Ruhr basin as possible.
French blood will not be spared (West Wall). The possession
of the Ruhr basin will determine the duration of our resistance.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Dutch and Belgium air bases will be occupied by armed
forces. Declarations of neutrality must be ignored. If England
and France intend the war between Germany and Poland
to lead to a conflict, they will support Holland and Belgium
in their neutrality and make them build fortifications in
order finally to force them into cooperation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Albeit under protest, Belgium and Holland will yield to
pressure.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore, if England intends to intervene in the Polish
war, we must occupy Holland with lightning speed. We must
aim at securing a new defense line on Dutch soil up to the
Zuider Zee.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The war with England and France will be a life-and-death
struggle.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The idea that we can get off cheaply is dangerous; there is
no such possibility. We must burn our boats, and it is no
longer a question of justice or injustice, but of life or death
for 80 million human beings.
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Question: Short or long war?</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Every country’s armed forces or government must aim at
a short war. The government, however, must also be prepared
for a war of 10-15 years’ duration.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“History has always shown that the people have believed
that wars would be short. In 1914, the opinion still prevailed
that it was impossible to finance a long war. Even
today this idea still persists in many minds. But on the contrary,
every state will hold out as long as possible, unless it
immediately suffers some grave weakening (e.g. Ruhr basin).
England has similar weaknesses.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“England knows that to lose a war will mean the end of her
world power.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>England</span> is the driving force against Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Her strength lies in the following:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The British themselves are proud, courageous, tenacious,
firm in resistance and gifted as organizers. They know
how to exploit every new development. They have the love of
adventure and bravery of the Nordic race. Quality is lowered
by dispersal. The German average is higher.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. World power in itself. It has been constant for 300
years. Extended by the acquisition of allies, this power is
not merely something concrete, but must also be considered
as a psychological force embracing the entire world. Add
to this immeasurable wealth, with consequential financial
credit.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Geopolitical safety and protection by strong sea power
and a courageous air force.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>England’s weakness</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If in the World War I we had had two battleships and two
cruisers more, and if the battle of Jutland had begun in the
morning, the British fleet would have been defeated and England
brought to her knees. It would have meant the end of
this war. It was formerly not sufficient to defeat the fleet.
Landings had to be made in order to defeat England. England
could provide her own food supplies. Today that is no
longer possible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The moment England’s food supply routes are cut, she is
forced to capitulate. The import of food and fuel depends on
the fleet’s protection.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If the German Air Force attacks English territory, England
will not be forced to capitulate in one day. But if the
fleet is destroyed immediate capitulation will be the result.
<span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“There is no doubt that a surprise attack can lead to a quick
decision. It would be criminal, however, for the government
to rely entirely on the element of surprise.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Experience has shown that surprise may be nullified by—</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Disclosure outside the limit of the military circles concerned.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Mere chance, which may cause the collapse of the whole
enterprise.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Human failings.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. Weather conditions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The final date for striking must be fixed well in advance.
Beyond that time, the tension cannot be endured for long.
It must be borne in mind that weather conditions can render
any surprise intervention by Navy and Air Force impossible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This must be regarded as a most unfavorable basis of
action.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. An effort must be made to deal the enemy a significant
or the final decisive blow right at the start. Consideration
of right and wrong or treaties do not enter into the matter.
This will only be possible if we are not involved in a war
with England on account of Poland.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. In addition to the surprise attack, preparation for a
long war must be made, while opportunities on the Continent
for England are eliminated.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Army will have to hold positions essential to the Navy
and Air Force. If Holland and Belgium are successfully
occupied and held, and if France is also defeated, the fundamental
conditions for a successful war against England will
have been secured.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“England can then be blockaded from Western France at
close quarters by the Air Force, while the Navy with its
submarines extend the range of the blockade.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Consequences</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“England will not be able to fight on the Continent:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Daily attacks by the Air Force and Navy will cut all her
life-lines:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany will not bleed to death on land.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Such strategy has been shown to be necessary by World
War I and subsequent military operations. World War I is
responsible for the following strategic considerations which
are imperative—</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. With a more powerful Navy at the outbreak of the War,
or a wheeling movement by the Army towards the Channel
ports, the end would have been different.
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. A country cannot be brought to defeat by an air force.
It is impossible to attack all objectives simultaneously, and
the lapse of time of a few minutes would evoke defense
counter-measures.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The unrestricted use of all resources is essential.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. Once the Army, in cooperation with the Air Force and
Navy, has taken the most important positions, industrial
production will cease in flow in to the bottomless pit of the
Army’s battles, and can be diverted to benefit the Air Force
and Navy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Army must, therefore, be capable of taking these positions.
Systematic preparation must be made for the attack.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Study to this end is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The aim will always be to force England to her knees.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A weapon will only be of decisive importance in winning
battles, so long as the enemy does not possess it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This applies to gas, submarines and the Air Force. It would
be true of the latter, for instance, as long as the English
Fleet had no available countermeasures; it will no longer
be the case in 1940 and 1941. Against Poland, for example,
tanks will be effective, as the Polish Army possesses no
counter-measures.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Where straightforward pressure is no longer considered
to be decisive, its place must be taken by the elements of
surprise and by masterly handling. * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Purpose:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Study of the entire problem.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Study of the events.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Study of the means needed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. Study of the necessary training.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Men with great powers of imagination and high technical
training must belong to the staff, as well as officers with
sober sceptic powers of understanding.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Working principles:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. No one is to take part in this who does not have to know
of it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. No one can find out more than he must know.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. When must the person in question know it at the very
latest? No one may know anything before it is necessary
that he know it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On Goering’s question, the Fuehrer decided that:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> The armed forces determine what shall be built.
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> In the shipbuilding program, nothing is to be changed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> The armament programs are to be modeled on the years
1943 or 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These minutes demonstrate that the Nazi conspirators were
proceeding in accordance with a plan. They demonstrate the
cold-blooded premeditation of the assault on Poland. They demonstrate
that the questions concerning Danzig, which the Nazis had
agitated with Poland as a political pretext, were not true questions,
but were false issues, issues agitated to conceal their
motive of aggressive, expansion for food, and <span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just one week prior to the launching of the attack on Poland,
Hitler made an address to his chief military commanders, at
Obersalzberg, on 22 August 1939. [Three reports of this meeting
are available: (<span class='it'>L-3</span>; <span class='it'>798-PS</span>; and <span class='it'>1014-PS</span>). The first of the
three documents (<span class='it'>L-3</span>) was obtained through an American newspaperman,
and purported to be original minutes of the Obersalzberg
meeting, transmitted to the newspaperman by some other
person. There was no proof of actual delivery to the intermediary
by the person who took the notes. That document (<span class='it'>L-3</span>) therefore,
merely served as an incentive to search for something better.
The result was that two other documents (<span class='it'>798-PS</span>) and
(<span class='it'>1014-PS</span>) were discovered in the OKW files at Flensberg. These
two documents indicate that Hitler on that day made two
speeches, one apparently in the morning and one in the afternoon.
Comparison of those two documents with the first document
(<span class='it'>L-3</span>) led to the conclusion that the first document was a
slightly garbled merger of the two speeches, and therefore was
not relied upon.]</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this day of 22 August 1939, Hitler addressed the supreme
commanders of the three branches of the armed forces, as well as
the commanding generals, (<span class='it'>Oberbefehlshabers</span>) as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have called you together to give you a picture of the political
situation, in order that you may have insight into the
individual element on which I base my decision to act, and
in order to strengthen your confidence. After this, we will
discuss military details.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It was clear to me that a conflict with Poland had to come
sooner or later. I had already made this decision in Spring.
[Apparently this referred to (<span class='it'>L-79</span>).] But I thought I would
first turn against the West in a few years, and only afterwards
against the East. But the sequence cannot be fixed.
One cannot close one’s eyes even before a threatening situation.
I wanted to establish an acceptable relationship with
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span>
Poland, in order to fight first against the West, but this plan
which was agreeable to me could not be executed, since essential
points have changed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It became clear to me that Poland would attack us, in case
of a conflict in the West.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Poland wants access to the sea.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The further development became obvious after the occupation
of the Memel region, and it became clear to me that
under the circumstances a conflict with Poland could arise
at an unopportune moment.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I enumerate as reasons for this reflection, first of all, two
personal constitutions, my own personality, and that of
Mussolini. Essentially, it depends on me, my existence, because
of my political activity.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Furthermore, the fact that probably no one will ever again
have the confidence of the whole German people as I do.
There will probably never again be a man in the future with
more authority. My existence is, therefore, a factor of great
value. But I can be eliminated at any time by a criminal or
an idiot.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The second personal factor is Il Duce. His existence is also
decisive. If something happens to him, Italy’s loyalty to the
alliance will no longer be certain. The basic attitude of the
Italian Court is against the Duce. Above all, the Court sees
in the expansion of the empire a burden. The Duce is the
man with the strongest nerves in Italy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The third factor, favorable for us is Franco. We can only
ask benevolent neutrality from Spain, but this depends on
Franco’s personality. He guarantees a certain uniformity
and steadiness of the present system in Spain. We must
take into account the fact that Spain does not as yet have
a Fascist Party of our internal unity.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On the other side, a negative picture, as far as decisive personalities
are concerned. There is no outstanding personality
in England or France.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For us it is easy to make decisions. We have nothing to
lose: we can only gain. Our economic situation is such, because
of our restrictions, that we cannot hold out more than
a few years. Goering can confirm this. We have no other
choice; we must act. Our opponents risk much and gain only
little. England’s stake in a war is unimaginably great. Our
enemies have men who are below average. No personalities,
no masters, no men of action.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Besides the personal factor, the political situation is favorable
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>
for us; in the Mediterranean rivalry among Italy,
France, and England; in the Orient tension, which leads to
the alarming of the Mohammedan world.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The English empire did not emerge from the last war
strengthened. From a maritime point of view, nothing was
achieved: Conflict between England and Ireland, the south
African Union became more independent, concessions had to
be made to India, England is in great danger, unhealthy industries.
A British statesman can look into the future only
with concern.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“France’s position has also deteriorated, particularly in the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Further favorable factors for us are these:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Since Albania, there is an equilibrium of power in the Balkans.
Yugoslavia carries the germ of collapse because of her
internal situation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Rumania did not grow stronger. She is liable to attack
and vulnerable. She is threatened by Hungary and Bulgaria.
Since Kemal’s death, Turkey has been ruled by small minds,
unsteady weak men.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All these fortunate circumstances will no longer prevail in
two to three years. No one knows how long I shall live.
Therefore conflict better now.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The creation of Greater Germany was a great achievement
politically but militarily it was questionable, since it was
achieved through a bluff of the political leaders. It is necessary
to test the military, if at all possible, not by general
settlement, but by solving individual tasks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The relation to Poland has become unbearable. My Polish
policy hitherto was in contrast to the ideas of the people.
My propositions to Poland, the Danzig corridor, were disturbed
by England’s intervention. Poland changed her tune
towards us. The initiative cannot be allowed to pass to
others. This moment is more favorable than in two to three
years. An attempt on my life or Mussolini’s could only
change the situation to our disadvantage. One cannot eternally
stand opposite one another with cocked rifle. A suggested
compromise would have demanded that we change our
convictions and make agreeable gestures. They talked to us
again in the language of Versailles. There was danger of
losing prestige. Now the probability is still great that the
West will not interfere. We must accept the risk with reckless
resolution. A politician must accept a risk as much as
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span>
a military leader. We are facing the alternative to strike or
to be destroyed with certainty sooner or later.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Now it is also a great risk. Iron nerves, iron resolution.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his second speech on 22 August 1939 the Fuehrer had this
to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It may also turn out differently regarding England and
France. One cannot predict it with certainty. I figure on a
trade-barrier, not on blockade, and with severance of relations.
Most iron determination on our side. Retreat before
nothing. Everybody shall have to make a point of it that we
were determined from the beginning to fight the Western
powers. Struggle for life or death. Germany has won every
war as long as she was united. Iron, unflinching attitude of
all superiors, greatest confidence, faith in victory, overcoming
of the past by getting used to heaviest strain. A long
period of peace would not do us any good. Therefore it is
necessary to expect everything. Manly bearing. It is not
machines that fight each other, but men. We have the better
quality of men. Mental factors are decisive. The opposite
camp has weaker people. In 1918, the Nation fell down because
the mental prerequisites were not sufficient. Frederic
the Great secured final success only through his mental
power.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Destruction of Poland in the foreground. The aim is elimination
of living forces, not the arrival at a certain line. Even
if war should break out in the West, the destruction of Poland
shall be the primary objective. Quick decision because
of the season.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I shall give a propagandistic cause for starting the war,
never mind whether it be plausible or not. The victor shall
not be asked, later on, whether we told the truth or not. In
starting and making a war, not the Right is what matters
but Victory.
<span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Have no pity. Brutal attitude. 80,000,000 people shall
get what is their right. Their existence has to be secured.
The strongest has the Right. Greatest severity.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Quick decision necessary. Unshakable faith in the German
soldier. A crisis may happen only if the nerves of the leaders
give way.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“First aim: advance to the Vistula and Narew. Our technical
superiority will break the nerves of the Poles. Every
newly-created Polish force shall again be broken at once.
Constant war of attrition.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“New German frontier according to healthy principle. Possibly
a protectorate as a buffer. Military operations shall
not be influenced by these reflections. Complete destruction
of Poland is the military aim. To be fast is the main thing.

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>Expansion into General War of Aggression: Scandinavia,
The Low Countries, The Balkans.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The aggressive war having been initiated in September 1939,
and Poland having been defeated shortly after the initial assaults,
the Nazi aggressors converted the war into a general war
of aggression extending into Scandinavia, into the Low Countries,
and into the Balkans. (Under the division of the case agreed
by the four Chief Prosecutors, this phase of aggression was left
for development to the British prosecuting staff, and is discussed
in Sections 9, 10 and 11 of this Chapter, <span class='it'>infra</span>.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>E. <span class='it'>Aggression Against the U. S. S. R.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The attack upon Russia was preceded with premeditation and
deliberation. Just as, in the case of aggression against Czechoslovakia,
the Nazis had a code name for the secret operation,
“Case Green”, so in the case of aggression against the Soviet
Union, they had a code name, “Case Barbarossa”. A secret
directive, Number 21, issued from the Fuehrer’s Headquarters
on 18 December 1940, relating to “Case Barbarossa,” was captured
among the OKW files at Flensberg (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>). This directive
was issued more than six months in advance of the attack.
(Other evidence shows that the planning occurred even earlier.)
This order, signed by Hitler and initialled by Jodl and Keitel,
was issued in nine copies, of which we have the fourth. The
directive reads:
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Armed Forces must be prepared to crush Soviet
Russia in a quick campaign before the end of the war
against England. (Case Barbarossa.)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For this purpose the Army will have to employ all available
units with the reservation that the occupied territories
will have to be safeguarded against surprise attacks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For the Eastern campaign the Air force will have to free
such strong forces for the support of the Army that a quick
completion of the ground operations may be expected and
that damage of the Eastern German territories will be
avoided as much as possible. This concentration of the main
effort in the East is limited by the following reservation:
That the entire battle and armament area dominated by us
must remain sufficiently protected against enemy air attacks
and that the attacks on England and especially the supply
for them must not be permitted to break down.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Concentration of the main effort of the Navy remains unequivocally
against England also during an Eastern campaign.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If occasion arises I will order the concentration of troops
for action against Soviet Russia eight weeks before the intended
beginning of operations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Preparations requiring more time to start are—if this has
not yet been done—to begin presently and are to be completed
by 15 May 1941.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Great caution has to be exercised that the intention of an
attack will not be recognized.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The preparations of the High Command are to be made on
the following basis:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I. <span class='it'>General Purpose</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The mass of the Russian Army in Western Russia is to be
destroyed in daring operations by driving forward deep
wedges with tanks and the retreat of intact battle-ready
troops into the wide spaces of Russia is to be prevented.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In quick pursuit a (given) line is to be reached from where
the Russian Air force will no longer be able to attack German
Reich territory. The first goal of operations is the protection
from Asiatic Russian from the general line Volga-Archangelsk.
In case of necessity, the last industrial area
in the Urals left to Russia could be eliminated by the Luftwaffe.</p>

<p class='noindent'>In the course of these operations the Russian Baltic Sea
Fleet will quickly erase its bases and will no longer be ready
to fight.
<span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Effective intervention by the Russian Air force is to be prevented
through forceful blows at the beginning of the operations.”
(<span class='it'>446-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another secret document captured from the OKW files establishes
the motive for the attack on the Soviet Union (<span class='it'>2718-PS</span>).
It also establishes the full awareness of the Nazi conspirators of
the Crimes against Humanity which would result from their attack.
The document is a memorandum of 2 May 1941 concerning
the results of a discussion on that day with the State Secretaries
concerning “Case Barbarossa.” The memorandum reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Matter for Chief; 2 copies; first copy to files Ia. Second
copy to General Schubert. May 2nd, 1941. Memorandum.
About the result of today’s discussion with the State Secretaries
about Barbarossa.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The war can only be continued if all armed forces are
fed by Russia in the third year of war.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. There is no doubt that as a result many millions of people
will be starved to death if we take out of the country
the things necessary for us.” (<span class='it'>2718-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>F. <span class='it'>Collaboration with Japan: Precipitation Of The Pearl Harbor
Attack.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>With the unleashing of the German aggressive war against
the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Nazi conspirators and,
in particular Ribbentrop, called upon the Eastern co-architect
of the New Order, Japan, to attack in the rear. The Nazi’s
incited and kept in motion a force reasonably calculated to result
in an attack on the United States. For a time, they preferred that
the United States not be involved in the conflict, due to military
considerations. However, their incitement resulted in the attack
on Pearl Harbor, and long prior to that attack, they had assured
the Japanese that they would declare War on the United States
should a United States-Japanese conflict occur. It was in reliance
on these assurances that the Japanese struck at Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These matters are disclosed in a document, captured from the
files of the German Foreign Office, which consists of notes dated
4 April 1941, signed by Schmidt, regarding discussions between
the Fuehrer and the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, in the
presence of Ribbentrop (<span class='it'>1881-PS</span>). Pertinent parts of this document
read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Matsuoka then also expressed the request, that the Fuehrer
should instruct the proper authorities in Germany to meet
as broad-mindedly as possible the wishes of the Japanese
Military Commission. Japan was in need of German help
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>
particularly concerning the U-boat warfare, which could be
given by making available to them the latest experiences of
the war as well as the latest technical improvements and
inventions. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Japan would do her utmost to avoid a war with the United
States. In case that the country should decide to attack
Singapore, the Japanese navy, of course, had to be prepared
for a fight with the United States, because in that case
America would probably side with Great Britain. He (Matsuoka)
personally believed, that the United States could be
restrained by diplomatic exertions from entering the war at
the side of Great Britain. Army and Navy had, however, to
count on the worse situation, that is war against America.
They were of the opinion that such a war would extend for
five years or longer and would take the form of guerilla warfare
in the Pacific and would be fought out in the South
Sea. For this reason the German experiences in her guerilla
warfare are of the greatest value to Japan. It was a question
how such a war would best be conducted and how all
the technical improvements of submarine, in all details such
as periscopes and such like, could best be exploited by Japan.
“To sum up, Matsuoka requested that the Fuehrer should see
to it that the proper German authorities would place at the
disposal of the Japanese these developments and inventions
concerning navy and army, which were needed by the Japanese.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer promised this and pointed out that Germany
too considered a conflict with the United States undesirable,
but that it had already made allowance for such a contingency.
In Germany one was of the opinion that America’s
contribution depended upon the possibilities of transportation,
and that this again is conditioned by the available tonnage.
Germany’s war against tonnage, however, means a
decisive weakening not merely against England, but also
against America. Germany has made her preparations so
that no American could land in Europe. She would conduct
a most energetic fight against America with her U-boats and
her Luftwaffe, and due to her superior experience, which
would still have to be acquired by the United States, she
would be vastly superior, and that quite apart from the fact,
that the German soldier naturally ranks high above the
American.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the further course of the discussion the Fuehrer pointed
<span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span>
out, that Germany on her part would immediately take the
consequences, if Japan would get involved with the United
States. It did not matter with whom the United States would
first get involved, if with Germany or with Japan. They
would always try to eliminate one country at a time, not to
come to an understanding with the other country subsequently.
Therefore Germany would strike, as already mentioned,
without delay in case of a conflict between Japan and
America, because the strength of the tripartite powers lies
in their joined action, their weakness would be if they would
let themselves be beaten individually.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Matsuoka once more repeated his request, that the Fuehrer
might give the necessary instructions, in order that the
proper German authorities would place at the disposal of the
Japanese the latest improvements and inventions, which are
of interest to them. Because the Japanese navy had to prepare
immediately for a conflict with the United States.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As regards Japanese-American relationship, Matsuoka explained
further that he has always declared in his country,
that sooner or later a war with the United States would be
unavoidable, if Japan continued to drift along as at present.
In his opinion this conflict would happen rather sooner than
later. His argumentation went on, why should Japan, therefore,
not decisively strike at the right moment and take the
risk upon herself of a fight against America? Just thus
would she perhaps avoid a war for generations, particularly
if she gained predominance in the South Seas. There
are, to be sure, in Japan many who hesitate to follow those
trends of thought. Matsuoka was considered in those circles
a dangerous man with dangerous thoughts. He, however,
stated that, if Japan continued to walk along her present
path, one day she would have to fight anyway and that this
would then be under less favorable circumstances than at
present.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer replied that he could well understand the situation
of Matsuoka, because he himself was in similar situations
(the clearing of the Rhineland, declaration of sovereignty
of armed Forces). He too was of the opinion that
he had to exploit favorable conditions and accept the risk of
an anyhow unavoidable fight at a time when he himself was
still young and full of vigor. How right he was in his attitude
was proven by events. Europe now was free. He would
not hesitate a moment instantly to reply to any widening of
the war, be it by Russia, be it by America. Providence favored
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span>
those who will not let dangers come to them, but who
will bravely face them.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Matsuoka replied, that the United States or rather their
ruling politicians had recently still attempted a last manoeuver
towards Japan, by declaring that America would not
fight Japan on account of China or the South Seas provided
that Japan gave free passage to the consignment of rubber
and tin to America to their place of destination. However,
America would war against Japan the moment she felt that
Japan entered the war with the intention to assist in the
destruction of Great Britain. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer commented on this, that this attitude of America
did not mean anything but that the United States had the
hope, that, as long as the British World Empire existed, one
day they could advance against Japan together with Great
Britain, whereas, in case of the collapse of the World Empire,
they would be totally isolated and could not do anything
against Japan.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Foreign Minister interjected that the Americans
precisely under all circumstances wanted to maintain the
powerful position of England in East Asia, but that on the
other hand it is proved by this attitude, to what extent she
fears a joint action of Japan and Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Matsuoka continued that it seemed to him of importance
to give to the Fuehrer an absolutely clear picture of
the real attitude inside Japan. For this reason he also had
to inform him regretfully of the fact that he (Matsuoka)
in his capacity as Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs
could not utter in Japan itself a single word of all that he
had expounded before the Fuehrer and the Reich Foreign
Minister regarding his plans. This would cause him serious
damage in political and financial circles. Once before,
he had committed the mistake, before he became Japanese
Minister for Foreign Affairs, to tell a close friend something
about his intentions. It seems that the latter had spread
these things and thus brought about all sorts of rumors,
which he as Foreign Minister had to oppose energetically,
though as a rule he always tells the truth. Under those
circumstances he also could not indicate, how soon he could
report on the questions discussed to the Japanese Premier
or to the Emperor. He would have to study exactly and
carefully in the first place the development in Japan, so as
to make his decision at a favorable moment, to make a clean
<span class='pageno' title='407' id='Page_407'></span>
breast of his proper plans towards the Prince Konoye and
the Emperor. Then the decision would have to be made
within a few days, because the plans would otherwise be
spoiled by talk.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Should he, Matsuoka, fail to carry out his intentions, that
would be proof that he is lacking in influence, in power of
conviction, and in tactical capabilities. However, should he
succeed, it would prove that he had great influence in Japan.
He himself felt confident that he would succeed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On his return, being questioned, he would indeed admit to
the Emperor, the Premier and the Ministers for the Navy
and the Army, that Singapore had been discussed; he would,
however, state that it was only on a hypothetical basis.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Besides this Matsuoka made the express request not to
cable in the matter of Singapore because he had reason to
fear that by cabling something might leak out. If necessary
he would send a courier.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer agreed and assured after all, that he could
rest entirely assured of German reticence.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Matsuoka replied he believed indeed in German reticence,
but unfortunately could not say the same of Japan.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The discussion was terminated after the exchange of
some personal parting words.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Berlin, the 4th of April 1941.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg410a'>2. PREPARATION FOR AGGRESSION: 1933-1936</h2>

<p class='pindent'>By 1933 the Nazi Party, the NSDAP, had reached very substantial
proportions. At that time its plans called for the acquisition
of political control of Germany. This was indispensable
for consolidation, within the country, of all the internal resources
and potentialities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as there was sufficient progress along this line of internal
consolidation, the next step was to become disengaged from
some of the external disadvantages of existing international limitations
and obligations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The restrictions of the Versailles Treaty were a bar to the development
of strength in all the fields necessary if Germany were
to make war. Although there had been an increasing amount of
circumvention and violation from the very time that the Versailles
Treaty came into effect, such operations under disguise and
subterfuge could not attain proportions adequate for the objectives
of the Nazis. To get the Treaty of Versailles out of the way
was indispensable to the development of the extensive military
power which they had to have for their purposes. It was as a
part of the same plan and for the same reason that Germany
withdrew from the Disarmament Conference and from the
League of Nations. It was impossible for the Nazis to carry out
their plan on the basis of existing international obligations or
on the basis of the orthodox kind of future commitments.
<span class='pageno' title='411' id='Page_411'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Every military and diplomatic operation undertaken by the
Nazis was preceded by a plan of action and a careful coordination
of all participating forces. At the same time each event was
part of a long prepared plan of aggression. Each represented a
necessary step in the preparation of the schedule of aggressions
which was subsequently carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three of the steps in preparation for aggression were first, the
withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference and the League
of Nations; second, the institution of compulsory military service;
and, third, the reoccupation of the demilitarized zone of the
Rhineland. Each of these steps was progressively more serious
in the matter of international relations. In each of these steps
Germany anticipated the possibility of sanctions being applied
by other countries, and, particularly, a strong military action
from France with the possible assistance of England. However,
the conspirators were determined that nothing less than a preventive
war would stop them, and they also estimated correctly
that no one or combination of big powers would undertake the
responsibility for such a war. The withdrawal from the Disarmament
Conference and from the League of Nations was, of
course, action that did not violate any international obligation.
The League Covenant provided the procedure for withdrawal.
These actions, however, cannot be disassociated from the general
conspiracy and the plan for aggression. The announcement
of the institution of universal military service was a more daring
action. It was a violation of the Versailles Treaty, but the Nazis
got away with it. Then came outright military defiance, with the
occupation of the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Planning to Overthrow the Versailles Treaty.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The determination and the plans of the Nazi conspirators to remove
the restrictions of Versailles, started very early. This fact
is confirmed by their own statements, their boasts of long planning
and careful execution. Hitler, in his speech to all Supreme
Commanders on 23 November 1939, stated that his primary goal
was to wipe out Versailles (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>). And Jodl, as Chief of the
General Staff of the Armed Forces, delivered an address after
four years of war, on 7 November 1943, in which he traced the
development of German strength (<span class='it'>L-172</span>). The seizure of power
to him meant the restoration of fighting sovereignty, including
conscription, occupation of the Rhineland, and rearmament, with
special emphasis on modern armor and air forces. In his speech,
entitled “The Strategic Position at the Beginning of the 5th Year
<span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>
of War,” General Jodl gave a retrospective summary of the war
for the benefit of the Reich and Gau leaders. He stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Introduction: Reichsleiter Bormann has requested me to
give you a review today of the strategic position in the beginning
of the 5th Year of War.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I must admit that it was not without hesitation that I
undertook this none too easy task. It is not possible to do it
justice with a few generalities. It is not necessary to say
openly what is. No one—the Fuehrer has ordered—may
know more or be told more than he needs for his own immediate
task, but I have no doubt at all in my mind, Gentlemen,
but that you need a great deal in order to be able to
cope with your tasks. It is in your Gaus, after all, and
among their inhabitants that all the enemy propaganda, the
defeatism, and the malicious rumours concentrate, that try
to find themselves a plan among our people. Up and down
the country the devil of subversion strides. All the cowards
are seeking a way out, or—as they call it—a political solution.
They say, we must negotiate while there is still something
in hand, and all these slogans are made use of to
attack the natural sense of the people, that in this war there
can only be a fight to the end. Capitulation is the end of
the Nation, the end of Germany. Against this wave of enemy
propaganda and cowardice you need more than force. You
need to know the true situation and for this reason I believe
that I am justified in giving you a perfectly open and uncolored
account of the state of affairs. This is no forbidden
disclosure of secrets, but a weapon which may perhaps help
you to fortify the morale of the people. For this war will
not only be decided by the force of arms but by the will of
the whole people. Germany was broken in 1918 not at the
front but at home. Italy suffered not military defeat but
morale defeat. She broke down internally. The result has
been not the peace she expected but—through the cowardice
of these criminal traitors—a fate thousand times harder
than continuation of the war at our side would have brought
to the Italian people. I can rely on you, Gentlemen, that
since I give concrete figures and data concerning our own
strength, you will treat these details as your secret; all the
rest is at your disposal without restriction for application in
your activities as leaders of the people.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The necessity and objectives of this war were clear to all
and everyone at the moment when we entered upon the War
of Liberation of Greater Germany and by attacking parried
<span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span>
the danger which menaced us both from Poland and from
the Western powers. Our further incursions into Scandinavia,
in the direction of the Mediterranean, and in that of
Russia—these also aroused no doubts concerning the general
conduct of the war so long as we were successful. It was not
until more serious set-backs were encountered and our general
situation began to become increasingly acute, that the
German people began to ask itself whether perhaps we had
not undertaken more than we could do and set our aims too
high. To provide an answer to this questioning and to furnish
you with certain points of view for use in your own explanatory
activities is one of the main points of my present
lecture; I shall divide it into three parts:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I. A review of the most important development up to
the present.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“II. Consideration of the present situation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“III. The foundation of our morale and our confidence in
victory.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of my position as military advisor to the Fuehrer,
I shall confine myself in my remarks to the problems of my
own personal sphere of action, fully appreciating at the same
time that in view of the protean nature of this war, I shall
in this way be giving expression only to one side of events.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“I. <span class='it'>Review</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The fact that the National Socialist movement and its
struggle for internal power were the preparatory stage of
the outer liberation from the bonds of the Dictate of Versailles
is not one on which I need enlarge in this circle. I
should like however to mention at this point how clearly all
thoughtful regular soldiers realize what an important part
has been played by the National Socialist movement in reawakening
the will to fight [<span class='it'>Wehrwillen</span>] in nurturing fighting
strength [<span class='it'>Wehrkraft</span>] and in rearming the German
people. In spite of all the virtue inherent in it, the numerically
small <span class='it'>Reichswehr</span> would never have been able to cope
with this task, if only because of its own restricted radius of
action. Indeed, what the Fuehrer aimed at—and has so happily
been successful in bringing about—was the fusion of
these two forces.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The seizure of power in its turn has meant in the first
place restoration of fighting sovereignty [<span class='it'>Wehrhoheit</span>—conscription,
occupation of the Rhineland] and rearmament
<span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span>
with special emphasis being laid on the creation of a modern
armoured and air arm.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The Austrian ‘<span class='it'>Anschlluss</span>’ in its turn, brought with it not
only the fulfillment of an old national aim but also had the
effect both of reinforcing our fighting strength and of materially
improving our strategic position. Whereas up till
then the territory of Czechoslovakia had projected in a most
menacing way right into Germany (a wasp waist in the direction
of France and an air base for the Allies, in particular
Russia), Czechoslovakia herself was now enclosed by pincers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Its own strategic position had now become so unfavorable
that she was bound to fall a victim to any attack pressed
home with rigour before effective aid from the West could
be expected to arrive.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This possibility of aid was furthermore made more difficult
by the construction of the West Wall, which, in contra-distinction
to the Maginot Line, was not a measure based on
debility and resignation but one intended to afford rear cover
for an active policy in the East.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. The bloodless solution of the Czech conflict in the autumn
of 1938 and spring of 1939 and the annexation of Slovakia
rounded off the territory of Greater Germany in such a way
that it now became possible to consider the Polish problem
on the basis of more or less favourable strategic premises.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This brings me to the actual outbreak of the present war,
and the question which next arises is whether the moment
for the struggle with Poland—in itself unavoidable—was
favorably selected or not. The answer to this question is all
the less in doubt since the opponent—after all, not inconsiderable
in himself—collapsed unexpectedly quickly, and the
Western Powers who were his friends, while they did declare
war on us and form a second front, yet for the rest
made no use of the possibilities open to them of snatching
the initiative from our hands. Concerning the course of the
Polish campaign, nothing further need be said beyond that
it proved in a measure which made the whole world sit up
and take notice a point which up till then had not been certain
by any means; that is, the high state of efficiency of the
young Armed Forces of Great Germany.” (<span class='it'>L-172</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In this speech General Jodl identifies himself fully with the
Nazi movement. His own words show that he was not a mere
soldier. Insofar as he is concerned, his speech identifies the military
with the political, it also shows the deliberation with which
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>
the Treaty of Versailles was abrogated by Germany and the demilitarized
zone of the Rhineland was militarized and fortified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one of Adolf Hitler’s reviews of the six-year period between
his ascendancy to power and the outbreak of hostilities, he not
only admitted but boasted about the orderly and coordinated long-range
planning. The minutes of conference of the Fuehrer kept
by Schmundt, his adjutant, contain the following passage:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the period 1933-1939 progress was made in all fields. Our
military system improved enormously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The period which lies behind us has, indeed, been put to
good use. All measures have been taken in the correct sequence
and in harmony with our aims.” (<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Economic and Financial Preparations for Aggressive War.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most significant preparations for aggressive war is
found in the Secret Reich Defense Law of 21 May 1935 (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>).
The law went into effect upon its passage. It stated at its outset
that it was to be made public instanter, but at the end of it
Adolf Hitler signed the decree ordering that it be kept secret.
General Thomas, who was in charge of War Armament Economy
and for some time a high-ranking member of the German
High Command, refers, to this law as the cornerstone of war
preparations. He points out that, although the law was not made
public until the outbreak of war, it was put into immediate execution
as a program for preparations. These statements are made
at page 25 of General Thomas’ work, “A History of the German
War and Armament Economy, 1923-1944.” (<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This secret law remained in effect until 4 September 1939, at
which time it was replaced by another secret defense law
(<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>) revising the system of defense organization and directing
more detailed preparations for the approaching status of
“mobilization,” which was clearly an euphemism for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The covering letter, under which this second Reich Defense
Law, was sent to the Ministry for Economy and Labor for Saxony
in Dresden, on 6 December 1939, was classified Top Secret and
read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Transportation Section, attention of Construction Chief
Counsellor Hirches, or representative in the office of the
Reich Protector in Bohemia and Moravia, received Prague,
5 September 1939, No. 274.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Inclosed please find a copy of the Reich Defense Law of 4
September 1938 and a copy each of the decrees of the Reich
Minister of Transportation, dated 7 October 1938, RL
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>
10.2212/38, top secret, and of 17 July 1939, RL/LV
1.2173/39, top secret. For your information and observance,
by order, signed Kretzchmar. 3 inclosures completed to
Dresden, 4 September 1939, signed Schneider 3 inclosures.
Receipt for the letter of 4 September 1939, with 3 inclosures,
signed 5 September, 1939, and returned to construction
Counsellor Kretzchmar.” (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus the second secret Reich Defense Law was transmitted under
top secret cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general plan for the breach of the Treaty of Versailles and
for the ensuing aggressions was carried out in four ways: (1)
secret rearmament from 1933 to March 1935; (2) the training
of military personnel (that includes secret or camouflage training);
(3) production of munitions of war; (4) the building of an
air force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The facts of rearmament and of secrecy are self-evident from
the events that followed. The significant phase of this activity
lies in the fact that it was necessary in order to break the barriers
of the Treaty of Versailles and of the Locarno Pact, and to make
ready for aggressive wars which were to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those activities by their nature and extent, could only have been
for aggressive purposes. The highest importance which the German
government attached to the secrecy of the program is emphasized
by the disguised methods of financing utilized both before
and after the announcement of conscription, and the rebuilding
of the army, on 16 March 1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The point is illustrated by an unsigned memorandum by Schacht
dated 3 May 1935, entitled, “The Financing of the Armament
program, “<span class='it'>Finanzierung der Ruestung</span>.” (1168-PS) It is not
signed by Schacht, but in an interrogation on 16 October 1945, he
identified it as being his memorandum. The memorandum reads
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Memorandum from Schacht to Hitler [identified by Schacht
as Exhibit A, interrogation 16 October 1945, page 40] May
3, 1935.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Financing of Armament. The following explanations are
based upon the thought, that the accomplishment of the
armament program with speed and in quantity is <span class='it'>the</span> problem
of German politics, that everything else therefore should
be subordinated to this purpose as long as the main purpose
is not imperiled by neglecting all other questions. Even after
March 16, 1935, the difficulty remains that one cannot undertake
the open propagandistic treatment of the German
people for support of armament without endangering our position
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>
internationally (without loss to our foreign trade).
The already nearly impossible financing of the armament
program is rendered hereby exceptionally difficult.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Another supposition must be also emphasized. The printing
press can be used only for the financing of armament to such
a degree, as permitted by maintaining of the money value.
Every inflation increases the prices of foreign raw materials
and increases the domestic prices, is therefore like a snail
biting its own tail. The circumstance that our armament had
to be camouflaged completely till March 16, 1935, and even
since this date the camouflage had to be continued to a larger
extent, making it necessary to use the printing press (bank
note press) already at the beginning of the whole armament
program, while it would have been natural, to start it (the
printing press) at the final point of financing. In the porte-feuille
of the Reichsbank are segregated notes for this purpose,
that is, armament, of 3,775 millions and 866 millions,
altogether 4,641 millions, out of which the armament notes
amount to Reichsmarks 2,374 millions, that is, of April 30,
1935. The Reichsbank has invested the amount of marks
under its jurisdiction, but belonging to foreigners in blank
notes of armament. Our armaments are also financed partly
with the credits of our political opponents. Furthermore,
500 million Reichsmarks were used for financing of armament,
which originated out of [<span class='it'>Reichsanleihe</span>], the federal
loans, placed with savings banks. In the regular budget, the
following amounts were provided. For the budget period
1933-34, Reichsmarks 750 millions; for the budget period
1934-35, Reichsmarks 1,100 millions; and for the budget period
1935-36, Reichsmarks 2,500 millions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The amount of deficits of the budget since 1928 increases
after the budget 1935-36 to 5 to 6 millions Reichsmarks. This
total deficit is already financed at the present time by short
term credits of the money market. It therefore reduces in
advance the possibilities of utilization of the public market
for the armament. The Minister of Finance [<span class='it'>Reichsfinanzminister</span>],
correctly points out at the defense of the budget:
As a permanent yearly deficit is an impossibility, as we cannot
figure with security with increased tax revenues in
amount balancing the deficit and any other previous debits,
as on the other hand a balanced budget is the only secure basis
for the impending great task of military policy. For all
these reasons we have to put in motion a fundamental and
conscious budget policy which solves the problem of armament
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span>
financing by organic and planned reduction of other expenditures
not only from the point of receipt, but also from
the point of expenditure, that is, by saving.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“How urgent this question is, can be deduced from the following,
that a large amount of task has been started by the
state and party and which is now in process, all of which are
not covered by the budget, but from contributions and credits,
which have to be raised by industry in addition to the
regular taxes.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The existing of various budgets side by side, which serve
more or less public tasks, is the greatest impediment for
gaining a clear view over the possibilities of financing the
armaments. A whole number of ministries and various
branches of the party have their own budgets, and for this
reason have possibilities of incomes and expenses, though
based on the sovereignty of finance of the state, but not subject
to the control of the Minister of Finance and therefore
also not subject to the control of the cabinet. Just as in the
sphere of politics the much too far-reaching delegation of
legislative powers to individuals brought about various states
within the states, exactly in the same way the condition of
various branches of state and party, working side by side
and against each other, has a devastating effect on the possibility
of financing. If on this territory concentration and
unified control is not introduced very soon, the solution of
the already impossible task of armament financing is endangered.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We have the following tasks:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(1) A deputy is entrusted with finding all sources and revenues,
which have its origin in contributions to the federal
government, to the state and party and in profits of public
and party enterprises.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(2) Furthermore experts, entrusted by the Fuehrer, have
to examine how these amounts were used and which of these
amounts can in the future be withdrawn from their previous
purpose.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(3) The same experts have to examine the investments of
all public and party organizations, to which extent this property
can be used for the purpose of armament financing.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(4) The federal Ministry of Finance is to be entrusted to
examine the possibilities of increased revenues by way of
new taxes or increasing of existing taxes.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The up-to-date financing of armaments by the Reichsbank
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>
under existing political conditions was a necessity and the
political success proved the correctness of this action. The
other possibilities of armament financing have to be started
now under any circumstances. For this purpose all absolutely
non-essential expenditures for other purposes must not
take place and the total financial strength of Germany, limited
as it is, has to be concentrated for the one purpose of
armament financing. Whether the problem of financing, as
outlined in this program, succeeds, remains to be seen, but
without such concentration, it will fail with absolute certainty.”

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Renunciation of Armament Provisions of Versailles Treaty.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>21 May 1935 was a very important date in the Nazi calendar. It
was on that date that the Nazis passed the secret Reich Defense
Law (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>). The secrecy of their armament operations had
already reached the point beyond which they could no longer
maintain successful camouflage. Since their program called for
still further expansion, they unilaterally renounced the armament
provisions of the Versailles Treaty on the same date, 21 May
1935. Hitler’s speech to the Reichstag on that day (<span class='it'>2288-PS</span>)
was published in “<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>” under the heading
“The Fuehrer Notifies the World of the Way to Real Peace.” Hitler declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The German Reich Government refuses to adhere to the
Geneva Resolution of 17 May.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Treaty of Versailles was not broken by Germany
unilaterally, but the well-known paragraphs of the dictate
of Versailles were violated, and consequently invalidated, by
those powers who could not make up their minds to follow
the disarmament requested of Germany with their own disarmament
as agreed upon by Treaty.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Because the other powers did not live up to their obligations
under the disarmament program, the Government
of the German Reich no longer considers itself bound
to those articles, which are nothing but a discrimination
against the German nation for an unlimited period of time,
since, through them, Germany is being nailed down in a
unilateral manner contrary to the spirit of the agreement.”
(<span class='it'>2288-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In conjunction with other phases of planning and preparation
for aggressive war, there were various programs for direct and
indirect training of a military nature. They included not only
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span>
the training of military personnel, but also the establishment and
training of other military organizations, such as the Police Force,
which could be and were absorbed by the Army. The extent of
this program for military training is indicated by Hitler’s boast
of the expenditure of ninety billion Reichsmarks during the
period 1933 to 1939, in the building up of the armed forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech by Adolf Hitler delivered on 1 September, 1939,
(<span class='it'>2322-PS</span>), which was published in the “<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>”
under the heading “The Fuehrer announces the Battle for the
Justice and Security of the Reich”, the following passage occurred:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For more than six years now, I have been engaged in building
up the German Armed Forces. During this period more
than ninety billion Reichsmarks were spent building up the
<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. Today, ours are the best-equipped armed forces
in the world, and they are superior to those of 1914. My
confidence in them can never be shaken.” (<span class='it'>2322-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The secret nature of this training program and the fact of its
early development is illustrated by a report to Hess, in 1932,
concerning the secret training of flying personnel, as well as the
early plans to build a military air force (<span class='it'>1143-PS</span>). This report
was sent in a letter from Schickedantz to Rosenberg, for delivery
to Hess. Apparently Schickedantz was very anxious that no one
but Hess should get this letter, and therefore sent it to Rosenberg
for personal delivery to Hess. The letter points out that the
civilian pilots should be so organized as to enable their transfer
into the military air force organization. The letter dated 20 October
1932, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dear Alfred [Rosenberg]: I am sending you enclosed a
communication from the RWM forwarded to me by our
confidential man (<span class='it'>Vertrauensmann</span>) which indeed is very
interesting. I believe we will have to take some steps so that
the matter will not be procured secretly for the Stahlhelm.
This report is not known to anybody else. I intentionally did
not inform even our tall friend.” [Rosenberg, in an interrogation
on 5 October 1945, identified this “tall friend” as being
Von Albensleben.] “I am enclosing an additional copy for
Hess, and ask you to transmit the letter to Hess by messenger,
as I do not want to write a letter to Hess for fear that it
might be read somewhere. <span class='it'>Mit bestem Gruss</span>, Yours Amo.”
(<span class='it'>1143-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Enclosed in the report is:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“Air Force Organization”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Purpose: Preparation of material and training of personnel
<span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span>
to provide for the case of the armament of the air force.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Entire management as a civilian organization will be transferred
to Col. Von Willberg, at present commander of Breslau,
who, retaining his position in the Reichwehr, is going
on leave of absence.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(a) Organizing the pilots of civilian air lines in such a way
as to enable their transfer to the air force organization.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(b) Prospects to train crews for military flying. Training
to be done within the organization for military flying of the
Stahlhelm [steel helmet] which is being turned over to Col.
Hanel, retired.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All existing organizations for sport flying are to be used
for military flying. Directions on kinds and tasks of military
flying will be issued by this Stahlhelm directorate. The
Stahlhelm organization will pay the military pilots 50 marks
per hour flight. These are due to the owner of the plane in
case he himself carries out the flight. They are to be divided
in case of non-owners of the plane, between flight organization,
proprietor and crew in the proportion of 10:20:20.
Military flying is now paid better than flying for advertisement
(40). We therefore have to expect that most proprietors
of planes or flying associations will go over to the
Stahlhelm organization. It must be achieved that equal conditions
will be granted by the RWM, also the NSDAP organization.”

</div>

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>Secret Rearmament</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The program of rearmament and the objectives of circumventing
and breaching the Versailles Treaty are forcefully shown
by a number of Navy documents, showing the participation and
cooperation of the German navy in this rearmament program
which was secret at first. When it was deemed safe to say so,
the Navy openly acknowledged that it had always been its objective
to break the Versailles Treaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1937 the Navy High Command (OKM) published a secret
book entitled, “The Fight of the Navy Against Versailles, 1919 to
1935”, written by Sea Captain Schussler (<span class='it'>C-156</span>). The preface refers
to the fight of the navy against the unbearable regulations
of the peace treaty of Versailles. The table of contents includes
a variety of navy activities, such as saving of coastal guns from
destruction as required by Versailles; independent armament
measures behind the back of the government and behind the back
of the legislative bodies; resurrection of the U-boat arm; economic
rearmament; and camouflaged rearmament from 1933 to
the freedom from the restrictions in 1935. (<span class='it'>C-156</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This book points out the significant effect of seizure of power
by the Nazis in 1933 on increasing the size and determining the
nature of the rearmament program. It also refers to the far-reaching
independence in the building and development of the
navy, which was only hampered insofar as concealment of rearmament
had to considered in compliance with the Versailles
Treaty (<span class='it'>C-156</span>). With the restoration of what was called the
military sovereignty of the Reich in 1935—the reoccupation of
the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland—the external camouflage
of rearmament was eliminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This book of the German navy bears the symbol of the Nazi
Party, the Swastika, in the spread eagle on the cover sheet, and
it is headed “secret”, underscored (<span class='it'>C-156</span>). Raeder has identified
this book in an interrogation and explained that the Navy tried
to fulfill the letter of the Versailles Treaty and at the same time
to make progress in naval development. The following are pertinent
extracts from the book:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The object and aim of this memorandum under the heading
‘Preface’, is to draw a technically reliable picture based on
documentary records and the evidence of those who took part
in the fight of the Navy against the unbearable regulations
of the peace treaty of Versailles. It shows that the Reich
navy after the liberating activities of the Free Corps and of
Scapa Flow did not rest, but found ways and means to lay
with unquenchable enthusiasm, in addition to the building
up of the 15,000-man navy, the basis for a greater development
in the future, and so create by work of soldiers and
technicians the primary condition for a later rearmament.
It must also distinguish more clearly the services of these
men, who, without being known in wide circles, applied
themselves with extraordinary zeal in responsibility in the
service of the fight against the peace treaty; thereby stimulated
by the highest feeling of duty, they risked, particularly
in the early days of their fight, themselves and their position
unrestrainedly in the partially self-ordained task. This compilation
makes it clearer, however, that even such ideal and
ambitious plans can be realized only to a small degree if
the concentrated and united strength of the whole people is
not behind the courageous activity of the soldier. Only when
the Fuehrer had created the second and even more important
condition for an effective rearmament in the coordination
of the whole nation and in the fusion of the political, financial
and spiritual power, could the work of the soldier find
its fulfillment. The framework of this peace treaty, the
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span>
most shameful known in world history, collapsed under the
driving power of this united will, [signed] The Compiler”.

<p class='pindent'>The following is a passage from Chapter IV:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The unification of the whole nation which was combined
with the taking over of power on 30 January 1933 was of
the decisive influence on the size and shape of further rearmament.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“While the second chamber, <span class='it'>Reichsrat</span>, approached its dissolution
and withdrew as a legislative body, the <span class='it'>Reichstag</span>
assumed a composition which could only take a one-sided
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>
attitude toward the rearmament of the armed forces. The
government took over the management of the rearmament
program upon this foundation.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“Development of the Armed Forces.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This taking over of the management by the Reich Government
developed for the armed forces in such a manner that
the War Minister, General von Blomberg, and through him
the three branches of the armed forces, received far-reaching
powers from the Reich Cabinet for the development
of the armed forces. The whole organization of the Reich
was included in this way. In view of these powers the collaboration
of the former inspecting body in the management
of the secret expenditure was from then on dispensed with.
There remained only the inspecting duty of the accounting
office of the German Reich.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“Independence of the Commander in Chief of the Navy”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The commander-in-chief of the Navy, Admiral Raeder, honorary
doctor, had received the help of a far-reaching independence
in the building and development of the navy. This
was only hampered insofar as the previous concealment of
rearmament had to be continued in consideration of the Versailles
Treaty. Besides the public budget there remained
the previous special budget, which was greatly increased in
view of the considerable credit for the provision of labor,
which was made available by the Reich. Wide powers in the
handling of these credits were given to the Director of the
Budget Department of the navy, up to 1934 Commodore
Schussler, afterwards Commodore Foerster. These took into
consideration the increased responsibility of the Chief of the
Budget.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“Declaration of Military Freedom”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“When the Fuehrer, relying upon the strength of the armed
forces executed in the meanwhile, announced the restoration
of the military sovereignty of the German Reich, the last-mentioned
limitation on rearmament works namely, the external
camouflage, was eliminated. Freed from all the
shackles which have hampered our ability to move freely on
and under water, on land and in the air for one and a half
decades, and carried by the newly-awakened fighting spirit
of the whole nation, the armed forces, and as part of it, the
navy, can lead with full strength towards its completion the
rearmament already under way with the goal of securing for
the Reich its rightful position in the world.” (<span class='it'>C-156</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='425' id='Page_425'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>An interrogation of Raeder concerning this book went as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. I have here a document, <span class='it'>C-156</span>, which is a photostatic
copy of the work prepared by the High Command of the
Navy, and covers the struggle of the Navy against the Versailles
Treaty from 1919 to 1935. I ask you initially whether
you are familiar with the work?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. I know this book. I read it once when it was edited.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. Was that an official publication of the Germany navy?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. This Captain Schuessler, indicated there, was Commander
in the Admiralty. Published by the OKM, which was
an idea of these officers to put all these things together.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. Do you recall the circumstances under which the authorization
to prepare such a work was given to him?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. I think he told me that he would write such a book as he
told us here in the foreword.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. In the preparation of this work he had access to the official
naval files, and based his work on the items contained
therein?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. Yes, I think so. He would have spoken with other persons,
and he would have had the files, which were necessary.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. Do you know whether before the work was published, a
draft of it was circulated among the officers in the Admiralty
for comment?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. No, I don’t think so. Not before it was published. I
saw it only when it was published.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. Was it circulated freely after its publication?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. It was a secret object. I think the upper commands in
the Navy had knowledge of it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. It was not circulated outside of the naval circles?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. No.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. What then is your opinion concerning the comments contained
in the work regarding the circumventing of the provisions
of the Versailles Treaty?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. I don’t remember very exactly what is in here. I can
only remember that the Navy had always the object to fulfill
the word of the Versailles Treaty, but wanted to have some
advantages. But the flying men were exercised one year before
they went into the Navy. Quite young men. So that
the word of the Treaty of Versailles was filled. They didn’t
belong to the Navy, as long as they were exercised in flying,
and the submarines were developed but not in Germany, and
not in the Navy, but in Holland. There was a civil bureau,
and in Spain there was an Industrialist; in Finland, too, and
<span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>
they were built much later when we began to act with the
English government about the Treaty of thirty-five to
one-hundred, because we could see that then the Treaty of
Versailles would be destroyed by such a treaty with England,
and so in order to keep the word of Versailles, we tried to
fulfill the word of Versailles, but tried to have advantages.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. Would the fair statement be that the Navy High Command
was interested in avoiding the limited provisions of
the Treaty of Versailles regarding the personnel and limits
of armaments, but would it attempt to fulfill the letter of the
treaty, although actually avoiding it?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. That was their endeavor”.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Raeder had his explanations:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. Why was such a policy adopted?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. We were much menaced in the first years after the first
war by danger that the Poles would attack East Prussia and
so we tried to strengthen a little our very, very weak forces in
this way, and so all our efforts were directed to the aim to
have a little more strength against the Poles, if they would
attack us; it was nonsense to them of attacking the Poles in
this state, and for the Navy a second aim was to have some
defense against the entering of French forces into the Ostsee,
or East Sea, because we knew the French had intentions to
sustain the Poles from ships that came into the Ostsee Goettinger,
and so the Navy was a defense against the attack by
the Poles, and against the entrance of French shipping into
an Eastern Sea. Quite defensive aims.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. When did the fear of attack from Poles first show itself
in official circles in Germany would you say?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. When the first years they took Wilma. In the same
minute we thought that they would come to East Prussia. I
don’t know exactly the year, because those judgments were
the judgments of the German government ministers, of the
Army and Navy Ministers, Groner and Noske.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. Then those views in your opinion were generally held
existing perhaps as early as 1919 or 1920, after the end of the
First World War?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. Oh, but the whole situation was very, very uncertain,
and about those years in the beginning, I can not give you a
very exact thing, because I was then two years in the Navy
archives to write a book about the war, and how the cruisers
fought in the first war. Two years, so I was not with these
things.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The same kind of aims and purposes are reflected in the table
<span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>
of contents of a history of the German Navy, 1919 to 1939, found
in captured official files of the German Navy (<span class='it'>C-17</span>). Although a
copy of the book itself has not been found, the project was written
by Oberst Scherff, Hitler’s special military historian. The table
of contents however, is available. It refers by numbers to groups
of documents and notes in the documents, which evidently were
intended as working material for the basis of the chapters to be
written in accordance with the table of contents. The title of this
table of contents fairly establishes the navy planning and preparations
that were to get the Versailles Treaty out of the way, and
to rebuild the navy strength necessary for war. Some of the

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The policy development of the navy is also reflected from the financial
side. The planned organization of the navy budget for
armament measures was based on a co-ordination of military developments
and political objectives. Military-political development
was accelerated after the withdrawal from the League of
Nations. (<span class='it'>C-17</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='430' id='Page_430'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A captured document, entitled “<span class='it'>Chef der Marineleitung</span>, Berlin,
12 May 1934,” and marked “Secret Commando Matter,” discusses
the “Armament Plan (A.P.) for the 3rd Armament Phase.”
(<span class='it'>C-153</span>). This document, which bears the facsimile signature of
Raeder at the end, speaks of war tasks, war and operational plans,
armament target, etc., and shows that it was distributed to many
of the High Command of the Navy. Dated 12 May 1934, it shows
that a primary objective was readiness for a war without any
alert period. The following are pertinent extracts:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>* * * “The planned organization of armament measures
is necessary for the realization of the target; this again requires
a coordinated and planned expenditure in peace time.
This organization of financial measures over a number of
years according to the military viewpoint is found in the
armament program and provides</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> for the <span class='it'>military leaders</span> a sound basis for their operational
considerations and</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> for the political leaders a clear picture of what may be
achieved with the military means available at a given time.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All theoretical and practical A-preparations are to be drawn
up with a primary view to readiness for a war without any
alert period.” (C-153)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The conspiratorial nature of these Nazi plans and preparations
long before the outbreak of hostilities is illustrated in many other
ways. Thus, in 1934, Hitler instructed Raeder to keep secret the
U-Boat construction program; also the actual displacement and
speed of certain ships. Work on U-Boats had been going on, as
already indicated, in Holland and Spain. The Nazi theory was
ingenious in that respect. The Versailles Treaty forbade re-arming
by the Germans in Germany, but the Nazis said it did not
forbid them to rearm in Holland, Spain, and Finland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secrecy was equally important then because of the pending
naval negotiations with England. The subject was discussed in
a conversation between Raeder and Adolf Hitler in June 1934.
The record of that conversation (<span class='it'>C-189</span>) is not signed by Raeder,
but in an interrogation on 8 November 1945, Raeder admitted
that (<span class='it'>C-189</span>) was a record of this conversation, and that it was
in his handwriting, though he did not sign his name at the end.
The report is headed, “Conversation with the Fuehrer in June
1934 on the occasion of the resignation of the Commanding Officer
of the <span class='it'>Karlsruhe</span>.” It reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Report by the C-in-C Navy concerning displacement of
D. and E. (defensive weapons).
<span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Fuehrer’s instructions: No mention must be made of a displacement
of 25-26,000 tons, but only of improved 10,000-ton
(ships). Also, the speed over 26 nautical miles may be stated.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. C-in-C Navy expresses the opinion that later on the Fleet
must anyhow be developed to oppose England, that therefore
from 1936 onwards, the large ships must be armed with 35
c.m. guns (Like the King George Class).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The Fuehrer demands to keep the construction of the
U-Boats completely secret. Plebiscite also in consideration
of the Saar.” (<span class='it'>C-189</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In order to continue the increase in navy strength, as planned,
more funds were needed than the navy had available. Hitler
therefore proposed to put funds of the Labor Front at the disposal
of the navy. This appears from another Raeder memorandum of
a conversation between Raeder with Hitler, on 2 November 1934
(<span class='it'>C-190</span>). This report, again, is not signed, but it was found in
Raeder’s personal file and seems clearly his memorandum. It is
headed: “Conversation with the Fuehrer on 2.11.34 at the time
of the announcement by the Commanding Officer of the “Emden”.
It reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. When I mentioned that the total funds to be made available
for the armed forces for 1935 would presumably represent
only a fraction of the required sum, and that therefore
it was possible that the navy might be hindered in its plans,
he replied that he did not think the funds would be greatly
decreased. He considered it necessary that the navy be speedily
increased by 1938 with the deadlines mentioned. In case
of need, he will get Dr. Ley to put 120-150 million from the
Labor Front at the disposal of the navy, as the money would
still benefit the workers. Later in a conversation with Minister
Goering and myself, he went on to say that he considered
it vital that the navy be increased as planned, as no war
could be carried on if the navy was not able to safeguard the
ore imports from Scandinavia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Then, when I mentioned that it would be desirable to
have six U-Boats assembled at the time of the critical situation
in the first quarter of 1935, he stated that he would keep
this point in mind, and tell me when the situation demanded
that the assembling should commence.” (<span class='it'>C-190</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then there is an asterisk and a note at the bottom:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The order was not sent out. The first boats were launched
in the middle of June 35 according to plan.” (<span class='it'>C-190</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The development of the armament industry by the use of foreign
markets was a program encouraged by the navy, so that this
<span class='pageno' title='432' id='Page_432'></span>
industry would be able to supply the requirements of the navy in
case of need. A directive of Raeder, dated 31 January 1933, and
classified “Secret Commando Matter,” requires German industry
to support the armament of the navy (<span class='it'>C-29</span>). It provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“<span class='it'>TOP SECRET</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'><span class='it'>General directions for support given by the German Navy to the German Armament Industry</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The effects of the present economic depression have led
here and there to the conclusion that there are no prospects
of an active participation of the German Armament Industry
abroad, even if the Versailles terms are no longer kept.
There is no profit in it and it is therefore not worth promoting.
Furthermore, the view has been taken that the increasing
“self-sufficiency” would in any case make such
participation superfluous.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“However obvious these opinions may seem, formed because
of the situation as it is today, I am nevertheless forced to
make the following contradictory corrective points:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> The economic crisis and its present effects must perforce
be overcome sooner or later. Though equality of rights in
war politics is not fully recognized today, it will, by the assimilation
of weapons, be achieved at some period, at least
to a certain extent,</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> The consequent estimation of the duties of the German
Armament Industry lies mainly in the <span class='it'>Military-political</span>
sphere. It is impossible for this industry to satisfy, militarily
and economically, the growing demands made of it by
limiting the deliveries to our own armed forces. Its capacity
must therefore be increased by the delivery of supplies
to foreign countries over and above our own requirements.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> Almost every country is working to the same end today,
even those which, unlike Germany, are not tied down by
restrictions. Britain, France, North America, Japan, and
especially Italy are making supreme efforts to ensure markets
for their armament industries. The use of their diplomatic
representations, of the propaganda voyages of their
most modern ships and vessels, of sending missions and also
of the guaranteeing of loans and insurance against deficits
are not merely to gain commercially advantageous orders for
their armament industries, but first and foremost to expand
their output from the point of view of military policy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>d.</span> It is just when the efforts to do away with the restrictions
imposed on us have succeeded, that the German Navy
<span class='pageno' title='433' id='Page_433'></span>
has an ever-increasing and really vital interest in furthering
the German Armament Industry and preparing the way for
it in every direction in the competitive battle against the
rest of the world.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>e.</span> If, however the German Armament Industry is to be able
to compete in foreign countries, it must inspire the <span class='it'>confidence</span>
of its purchasers. The condition for this is that
secrecy for our own ends be not carried too far. The amount
of material to be kept secret under all circumstances in the
interest of the defence of the country is comparatively small.
I would like to issue a warning against the assumption that,
at the present stage of technical development in foreign
industrial states, a problem of vital military importance
which we perhaps have solved, has not been solved there.
Solutions arrived at today, which may become known, if
divulged to a third person by naturally always possible indiscretion,
have often been already superseded by new and
better solutions on our part, even at that time or at any rate
after the copy has been made. It is of greater importance
that we should be technically well to the fore in any really
fundamental matters, than that less important points should
be kept secret unnecessarily and excessively.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>f.</span> To conclude: I attach particular importance to guaranteeing
the continuous support of the industry concerned by
the navy, even after the present restrictions have been relaxed.
If the purchasers are not made confident that something
special is being offered them, the industry will not be
able to stand up to the competitive battle and therefore will
not be able to supply the requirements of the German Navy
in case of need.” (C-29)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This surreptitious rearmament, in violation of treaty obligations,
starting even before the Nazi came into power, is illustrated
by a 1932 order of Raeder, chief of the naval command,
addressed to the main naval command, regarding the concealed
construction of torpedo tubes in E-Boats (<span class='it'>C-141</span>). He ordered
that torpedo tubes be removed and stored in the naval arsenal
but be kept ready for immediate refitting. By using only the
number permitted under the Treaty, at a given time, and by storing
them after satisfactory testing, the actual number of operationally
effective E-Boats was constantly increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This German order for the concealed armament of E-Boats,
issued by Raeder on 10 February 1932, provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of our treaty obligations and the Disarmament
Conference steps must be taken to prevent the 1st E-Boat-Half-Flotilla,
<span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span>
which in a few months will consist of exactly
similar newly built (E)-Boats, from appearing openly as a
formation of torpedo-carrying boats as it is not intended to
count these E-Boats against the number of torpedo-carrying
boats allowed us.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I therefore order:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. S2-S5, will be commissioned in the shipyard Luerssen,
Vegesack without armament, and will be fitted with easily
removable cover-sheet-metal on the spaces necessary for torpedo-tubes.
The same will be arranged by T.M.I. [Inspectorate
of Torpedoes and Mining] in agreement with the
naval arsenal, for the Boat ‘S1’ which will dismantle its
torpedo-tubes, on completion of the practice shooting, for
fitting on another boat.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The torpedo-tubes of all S-Boats will be stored in the
naval arsenal ready for immediate fitting. During the trial
runs the torpedo-tubes will be taken on board one after the
other for a short time to be fitted and for practice shooting
so that only one boat at a time carries torpedo armament.
For public consumption this boat will be in service for the
purpose of temporary trials by the T.V.A. [Technical Research
Establishment].</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It should not anchor together with the other, unarmed boats
of the Half-Flotilla because of the obvious similarity of type.
The duration of firing, and consequently the length of time
the torpedo-tubes are aboard, is to be as short as possible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Fitting the torpedo-tubes on all E-Boats is intended as
soon as the situation of the political control allows it.” (<span class='it'>C-141</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Along similar lines the navy was also carrying on the concealed
preparation of auxiliary cruisers, under the disguised designation
of Transport Ships O. The preparations under this order were
to be completed by 1 April 1935. At the very time of construction
of these ships as commercial ships, plans were made for
their conversion. This was the result of a Top Secret order from
the command office of the navy, dated 12 March 1934, and signed
in draft by Groos. This order bears the seal of the <span class='it'>Reichministerium,
Marineleitung</span>, over the draft signature. It provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Preparation of Auxiliary Cruisers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is intended to include in the Establishment Organization
35 (<span class='it'>AG-Aufstellungsgliederung</span>) a certain number of auxiliary
cruisers which are intended for use in operations on the
high seas.
<span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“In order to disguise the intention and all the preparations
the ships will be referred to as “Transport Ships O”. It is requested
that in future this designation only will be used.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The preparations are to be arranged so that they can be
completed by 1.4.35.” (<span class='it'>C-166</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the official navy files, notes were kept year by year, from
1927 to 1940, on the reconstruction of the German Navy. One
of these notes discloses that the displacement of the battleship
“<span class='it'>Scharnhorst-Gneisenau</span>” was actually greater than the tonnage
which had been notified to the British under the treaty obligations:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The true displacement of the battleship ‘<span class='it'>Scharnhorst-Gneisenau</span>’
<span class='it'>and</span> ‘F/G’ exceeds by 20 percent in both cases the displacement
reported to the British.” (<span class='it'>C-23</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>There is annexed to this document a table with reference to different
ships, and two columns, headed “Displacement by Type”;
one column reads “Actual Displacement,” and the other, “Notified
Displacement.” The actual displacement of the “<span class='it'>Scharnhorst</span>”, is
thus shown to be 31,300 tons, although the notified displacement
was only 26,000 tons. On the “F/G” actual was 41,700, while
notified was 35,000. On the “HI”, actual was 56,200 tons, while
notified was 46,850. And so on down the list. (<span class='it'>C-23</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these notes there also occurs the statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In a clear cut program for the construction, the Fuehrer
and Reich Chancellor has set the navy the task of carrying
out the aims of his foreign policy.” (<span class='it'>C-23</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The German Navy constantly planned and committed violations
of armament limitation, and with characteristic German thoroughness
had prepared superficial pretexts to explain away these
violations. Following a conference with the chief of “A” section
[the military department of the Navy], an elaborate survey list
was prepared and compiled, giving a careful list of the quantity
and type of German naval armament and ammunition on hand
under manufacture or construction (<span class='it'>C-32</span>). A statement of the
justification or defense that might be used was included in those
instances where the Versailles Treaty was violated or its allotment
has been exceeded. The list contained 30 items under “Material
Measures” and 14 items under “Measures of Organization.”
The variety of details covered necessarily involved several sources
within the navy, which must have realized their significance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Top Secret document, which is headed “A Survey Report
of German Naval Armament after Conference with Chief of “A”
Section, dated 9 September 1933,” contains three columns, one
headed “Measure,” one headed “Material Measures, Details,” and
the third headed “Remarks.” The “Remarks” contain the pretext
<span class='pageno' title='436' id='Page_436'></span>
or justification for explaining away the violations of the
treaty. The following are examples:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“1. Exceeding the permitted number of mines.” Then figures
are given. “Remarks: Further mines are in part ordered, in
part being delivered.” (<span class='it'>C-32</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Number 2. Continuous storing of guns from the North Sea
area for Baltic artillery batteries.” The remarks column reads,
“Justification: Necessity for over-hauling. Cheaper repairs.”
(<span class='it'>C-32</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Number 6. Laying gun-platforms in the Kiel area.” Remarks:
“The offense over and above that in serial number 3 lies in the
fact that all fortifications are forbidden in the Kiel area. This
justification will make it less severe; pure defense measures.”
(<span class='it'>C-32</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Number 7. Exceeding the calibre permitted for coastal batteries.”
Remarks: “Possible justification is that, though the calibre
is larger, the number of guns is less.” (<span class='it'>C-32</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Number 8. Arming of mine-sweepers.” Remarks: “The
guns are taken from the fleet reserve stores, have been temporarily
installed only for training purposes. All nations arm their
mine-sweeping forces (equality of rights).” (<span class='it'>C-32</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Number 13. Exceeding the number of machine guns, et
cetera, permitted.” Remarks: “Can be made light of.” (<span class='it'>C-32</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Number 18. Construction of U-boat parts.” Remarks: “Difficult
to detect. If necessary can be denied.” (<span class='it'>C-32</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Number 20. Arming of fishing vessels.” Remarks: “For
warning shots. Make little of it.” And so on throughout the
list (<span class='it'>C-32</span>). This document must have been used as a guide for
negotiators who were attending the Disarmament Conference,
as to the position that they might take.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>E. <span class='it'>Withdrawal From the Disarmament Conference and the
League of Nations: Building of the Air Force.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point, on 14th October 1933, Germany withdrew from
the International Disarmament Conference and from the League
of Nations. The Nazis took this opportunity to break away from
the international negotiations and to take an aggressive position
on an issue which would not be serious enough to provoke reprisal
from other countries. At the same time, Germany attached
so much importance to this action that it considered the
possibility of the application of sanctions by other countries. In
anticipation of the probable nature of such sanctions and the
countries which might apply them, plans were made for armed resistance
on land, at sea, and in the air. Military preparations
<span class='pageno' title='437' id='Page_437'></span>
were ordered in a directive from the Reichsminister for Defense
(von Blomberg) to the head of the Army High Command
(Fritsch), the head of the Navy High Command, (Raeder), and
the Reichsminister for Air, (Goering) (<span class='it'>C-140</span>). This directive,
dated 25 October 1933, 11 days after the withdrawal from the
Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations, provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The enclosed directive gives the basis for preparation
of the armed forces in the case of sanctions being applied
against Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. I request the chiefs of the Army and Navy High Command
and the Reichsminister for Air to carry out the preparations
in accordance with the following points:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>a</span>) Strictest secrecy. It is of the utmost importance that
no facts become known to the outside world from which
preparation for resistance against sanctions can be inferred
or which is incompatible with Germany’s existing obligations
in the sphere of foreign policy regarding the demilitarized
zone. If necessary, the preparations must take second place
to this necessity.” (<span class='it'>C-140</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>One of the immediate consequences of this action was that following
the withdrawal from the League of Nations, Germany’s
armament program was still further increased. As it was ordered
on 12 May, 1934:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“5. Owing to the speed of military political development since
Germany quitted Geneva and based on the progress of the
army, the new A-Plan will only be drawn up for a period of
two years. The third A phase lasts accordingly from 1.4.34
to 31.3.36.” (<span class='it'>C-153</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 10 March 1935, Goering announced that Germany was
building a military air force. At page 1830 of <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span> it is
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Minister for Aviation, General of the Airmen,
Goering, in his talk with the special correspondent of the
Daily Mail, Ward Price, expressed himself on the subject of
the German Air Force.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“General Goering said:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the extension of our national defense [<span class='it'>Sicherheit</span>], it was
necessary, as we repeatedly told the world, to take care of
defense in the air. As far as that is concerned, I restricted
myself to those measures absolutely necessary. The guiding
line of my actions was, not the creation of an aggressive
force which would threaten other nations, but merely the
<span class='pageno' title='438' id='Page_438'></span>
completion of a military aviation which would be strong
enough to repel, at any time, attacks on Germany.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In conclusion, the correspondent asked whether the German
Air Force will be capable of repelling attacks on Germany.
General Goering replied to that exactly as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Air Force is just as passionately permeated
with the will to defend the Fatherland to the last as it is
convinced, on the other hand, that it will never be employed
to threaten the peace of other nations.” (<span class='it'>2292-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Since they had gone as far as they could on rearmament and
the secret training of personnel, the next step necessary to the
conspirators’ program for aggressive war was a large-scale increase
in military strength. This could no longer be done under
disguise and camouflage, and would have to be known to the
world. Accordingly, on 16 March 1935, there was promulgated a
law for universal military service, in violation of Article 173 of
the Versailles Treaty. That law appeared in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Title I, Vol. I, 1935, page 369. The text of the law itself
provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In this spirit the German Reich Cabinet has today passed
the following law:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Law for the Organization of the Armed Forces of March 16,
1935.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Cabinet has passed the following law which is
herewith promulgated:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Section 1.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Service in the Armed Forces is based upon compulsory military
duty.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Section 2.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In peace time, the German Army, including the police troops
transferred to it, is organized into: 12 Corps and 36 Divisions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Section 3.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Minister of War is charged with the duty of submitting
immediately to the Reich Ministry detailed laws on
compulsory military duty.” (<span class='it'>1654-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The law is signed first by the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor
Adolf Hitler, and then by many other officials, including von Neurath,
Frick, Schacht, Goering, Hess, and Frank. (<span class='it'>1654-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>F. <span class='it'>Assurances.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As a part of their program to weaken resistance in other states,
the Nazis followed a policy of making false assurances, thereby
<span class='pageno' title='439' id='Page_439'></span>
tending to create confusion and a false sense of security. Thus,
on 21 May 1935, the same date on which Germany renounced the
armament provisions of the Versailles Treaty, Hitler announced
the intent of the German Government to respect the territorial
limitations of the Versailles and Locarno Treaties. In his speech
in the Reichstag on that date Hitler stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore, the Government of the German Reich shall absolutely
respect all other articles pertaining to the cooperation
[<span class='it'>zusammenleben</span>] of the various nations including territorial
agreements; revisions which will be unavoidable as
time goes by it will carry out by way of a friendly understanding
only.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Government of the German Reich has the intention not
to sign any treaty which it believes not to be able to fulfill.
However, it will live up to every treaty signed voluntarily
even if it was composed before this government took over.
Therefore, it will in particular adhere to all the allegations
under the Locarno Pact as long as the other partners of the
pact also adhere to it.” (<span class='it'>2288-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>For convenient reference, the territorial limitations in the Locarno
and Versailles Treaties, include the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 1 of the Rhine Pact of Locarno, 16 October 1925, provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The High Contracting parties, collectively and severally,
guarantee, in the manner provided in the following Articles:
the maintenance of the territorial status quo, resulting from
the frontiers between Germany and Belgium and between
Germany and France and the inviolability of the said frontiers,
as fixed by, or in pursuance of the Treaty of Peace,
signed at Versailles, on June 28, 1919, and also the observance
of the stipulation of Articles 42 and 43 of the said
Treaty, concerning the demilitarized zone.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That has reference, of course, to the demilitarized zone of the
Rhineland.</p>

<p class='noindent'>Article 42 of the Versailles Treaty, 28 June 1919, provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany is forbidden to maintain or construct any fortifications
either on the left bank of the Rhine or on the right
bank, to the west of the line drawn 50 kilometers to the east
of the Rhine.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Article 43 provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the area defined above, the maintenance and the assembly
of armed forces, either permanently or temporarily and
military maneuvers of any kind, as well as the upkeep of all
<span class='pageno' title='440' id='Page_440'></span>
permanent works for mobilization, are in the same way forbidden.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>G. <span class='it'>Reoccupation of the Rhineland.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The demilitarized zone of the Rhineland was a sore spot with the
Nazis ever since its establishment after World War I. Not only
was this a blow to their increasing pride, but it was a bar to any
effective strong position which Germany might want to take on
any vital issues. In the event of any sanctions against Germany,
in the form of military action, the French and other powers would
get well into Germany east of the Rhine, before any German resistance
could even be put up. Therefore, any German plans to
threaten or breach international obligations, or for any kind of
aggression, required the preliminary reoccupation and refortification
of this open Rhineland territory. Plans and preparations
for the reoccupation of the Rhineland started very early.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A document apparently signed in the handwriting of von Blomberg,
deals with what is called “Operation <span class='it'>Schulung</span>”, meaning
schooling or training (<span class='it'>C-139</span>). It is dated 2 May 1935 and refers
to prior staff discussions on the subject. It is addressed to
the Chief of the Army Command, who at that time was Fritsch;
the Chief of the Navy High Command (Raeder); and the Reich
Minister for Air (Goering). The document does not use the name
“Rhineland” and does not, in terms, refer to it. It seems clear,
however, that it was a plan for the military reoccupation of the
Rhineland, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the Rhine
Pact of Locarno. The first part, headed “Secret Document,” provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the operation, suggested in the last staff talks of the
Armed Forces, I lay down the <span class='it'>Code name Schulung</span> [training].</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The supreme direction of the operation ‘<span class='it'>Schulung</span>’ rests with
the Reich Minister of Defense as this is a joint undertaking
of the three services.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Preparations for the operation will begin forthwith according
to the following directives:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. General.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The operation must, on issue of the code word ‘Carry out
<span class='it'>Schulung</span>,’ be executed by a surprise blow at lightning speed.
<span class='it'>Strictest</span> secrecy is necessary in the preparations and only
the very smallest number of officers should be informed and
employed in the drafting of reports, drawings, etc., and these
officers only in person.
<span class='pageno' title='441' id='Page_441'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. There is no time for mobilization of the forces taking
part. These will be employed in their peace-time strength
and with their peace-time equipment.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The preparation for the operation will be made without
regard to the present inadequate state of our armaments.
Every improvement of the state of our armaments will make
possible a greater measure of preparedness and thus result in
better prospects of success.” (<span class='it'>C-139</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the order deals with military details. There are
certain points in this order which are inconsistent with any theory
that it was merely a training order, or that it might have been
defensive in nature. The operation was to be carried out as a surprise
blow at lightning speed. The air forces were to provide
support for the attack. There was to be reinforcement by the
East Prussian division. Furthermore, since this order is dated
2 May 1935, which is about 6 weeks after the promulgation of the
Conscription Law of 16 March 1935, it could hardly have been
planned as a defensive measure against any expected sanctions
which might have been applied by reason of the passage of the
Conscription Law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The actual reoccupation of the Rhineland did not take place
until 7 March, 1936, and this early plan (<span class='it'>C-139</span>) necessarily underwent
revision to suit changed conditions and specific objectives.
That the details of this particular plan were not ultimately the
ones that were carried out in reoccupying the Rhineland does not
detract from the fact that as early as 2 May 1935, the Germans
had already planned that operation, not merely as a staff plan
but as a definite operation. It was evidently not on their timetable
to carry out the operation so soon, if it could be avoided.
But they were prepared to do so if necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is significant to note the date of this order is the same as the
date of the signing of the Franco-Russian Pact, which the Nazis
later asserted as their excuse for the Rhineland reoccupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The military orders on the basis of which the Rhineland reoccupation
was actually carried into execution on 7 March 1936, were
issued on 2 March 1936 by the War Minister and Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces, von Blomberg. They were addressed
to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army (Fritsch), the Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy (Raeder), and the Air Minister and
C-in-C of the Air Force (Goering) (<span class='it'>C-159</span>). That order, classified
“Top Secret”, in the original bears Raeder’s initial in green
pencil, with a red pencil note, “To be submitted to the C-in-C of
the Navy”.
<span class='pageno' title='442' id='Page_442'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>The first part of the Order reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Supreme Command of the Navy:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor has made the following
decision:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“By reason of the Franco-Russian alliance, the obligations
accepted by Germany in the Locarno Treaty, as far as they
apply to Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, which
referred to the demilitarized zone, are to be regarded as obsolete.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Sections of the army and air force will therefore be
transferred simultaneously in a surprise move to garrisons
of the demilitarized zone. In this connection, I issue the following
orders: * * *” (<span class='it'>C-159</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>There follow detailed orders for the military operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The order for Naval cooperation was issued on 6 March 1936,
in the form of an order on behalf of the Reich Minister for War,
von Blomberg, signed by Keitel, and addressed to the Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy (Raeder) (<span class='it'>C-194</span>). The order set out detailed
instructions for the Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet and
the admirals commanding the Baltic and North Sea. The short
covering letter is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“To: C-in-C Navy:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Minister has decided the following after the meeting:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The inconspicuous air reconnaissance in the German bay,
not over the line Texel-Doggerbank, from midday on Z-Day
onward, has been approved. C-in-C air force will instruct
the air command VI from midday 7 March to hold in readiness
single reconnaissance aircraft to be at the disposal of
the C-in-C fleet.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The Minister will reserve the decision to set up a U-Boat
reconnaissance on line, until the evening of 7 March. The
immediate transfer of U-Boats from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven
has been approved.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The proposed advance measures for the most part exceed
Degree of Emergency A and therefore are out of the question
as the first counter-measures to be taken against military
preparations of neighboring states. It is far more essential
to examine the advance measures included in Degree of
Emergency A, to see whether one or other of the especially
conspicuous measures could not be omitted.” (<span class='it'>C-194</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The reoccupation and fortification of the Rhineland was carried
out on 7 March 1936. For the historical emphasis of this
occasion, Hitler made a momentous speech on the same day, in
which he declared:
<span class='pageno' title='443' id='Page_443'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Men of the German Reichstag! France has replied to the
repeated friendly offers and peaceful assurances made by
Germany by infringing the Reich pact through a military alliance
with the Soviet Union exclusively directed against
Germany. In this manner, however, the Locarno Rhine Pact
has lost its inner meaning and ceased in practice to exist.
Consequently, Germany regards herself, for her part, as no
longer bound by this dissolved treaty. The German government
are now constrained to face the new situation created
by this alliance, a situation which is rendered more acute by
the fact that the Franco-Soviet treaty has been supplemented
by a Treaty of Alliance between Czechoslovakia and the
Soviet Union exactly parallel in form. In accordance with
the fundamental right of a nation to secure its frontiers and
ensure its possibilities of defense, the German government
have today restored the full and unrestricted sovereignty of
Germany in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland.”
(<span class='it'>2289-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The German reoccupation of the demilitarized zone of the
Rhineland caused extensive international repercussions. As
a result of the protests lodged with the League of Nations, the
Council of the League made an investigation and announced the
following finding, which is published in the League of Nations
monthly summary, March, 1936, Volume 16, Page 78. [It is also
quoted in the <span class='it'>American Journal of International Law</span>, page 487
(1936)]:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“That the German government has committed a breach of
Article 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, by causing on March
7, 1936, military forces to enter and establish themselves in
the demilitarized zone, referred to in Article 42 and the following
articles of that Treaty, and in the Treaty of Locarno.
At the same time, on March 7, 1936, the Germans reoccupied
the Rhineland in flagrant violation of the Versailles and Locarno
Treaties. They again tried to allay the fears of other
European powers and lead them into a false sense of security
by announcing to the world ‘we have no territorial demands
to make in Europe.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The last phrase occurred in Hitler’s speech on 7 March 1936:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We have no territorial claims to make in Europe. We know
above all that all the tensions resulting either from false territorial
settlements or from the disproportion of the numbers
of inhabitants to their living space cannot, in Europe, be
solved by war.” (<span class='it'>2289-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The existence of prior plans and preparations for the reoccupation
<span class='pageno' title='444' id='Page_444'></span>
and fortification of the Rhineland is indisputable. The
method and sequence of these plans and their accomplishments
are clearly indicative of the increasingly aggressive character of
the Nazi objectives, international obligations and considerations
of humanity notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators were determined, as these documents
have shown, to use whatever means were necessary to abrogate
and overthrow the Treaty of Versailles and its restrictions upon
the military armament and activity of Germany. In this process,
they conspired and engaged in secret armament and training, the
secret production of munitions of war, and they built up an air
force. They withdrew from the International Disarmament Conference
and the League of Nations on 14 October 1933. They instituted
universal military service on 16 March 1935. On 21 May
1935 they falsely announced that they would respect the territorial
limitations of Versailles and Locarno. On March 7 1936
they reoccupied and fortified the Rhineland and at the same time,
falsely announced that they had no territorial demands in Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The accomplishment of all these objectives, particularly the repudiation
of the Versailles Treaty restrictions, opened the gates
for the numerous aggressions which were to follow.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg450a'>3. AGGRESSION AGAINST AUSTRIA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>The Events Leading up to the Autumn of 1937 and the
Strategic Position of the National Socialists in Austria.</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The National Socialist Aim of Absorption of Austria.</span> In
order to understand more clearly how the Nazi conspirators proceeded
after the meeting in the Reichschancellery on 5 November
1937, at which Hitler laid plans for the conquest of Austria and
Czechoslovakia (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>), it is advisable to review the steps which
had already been taken in Austria by the National Socialists of
both Germany and Austria. The position which the Nazis had
reached by the Fall of 1937 made it possible for them to complete
their absorption of Austria much sooner and with less cost than
was contemplated in this meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The acquisition of Austria had long been a central aim of the
German National Socialists. On the first page of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>,
Hitler had written, “German-Austria must return to the great
German mother-land.” He continued by stating that this purpose,
of having common blood in a common Reich, could not be satisfied
<span class='pageno' title='451' id='Page_451'></span>
by a mere economic union. This aim was regarded as a serious
program which the Nazis were determined to carry out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This fact is borne out by an affidavit executed in Mexico City
on 28 August 1945 by George S. Messersmith, United States
Ambassador in Mexico City (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>). Mr. Messersmith was
Consul General of the United States of America in Berlin from
1930 to the late Spring of 1934. He was then made American
Minister in Vienna, where he stayed until 1937. In this affidavit
he states that the nature of his work brought him into frequent
contact with German Government officials, many of whom were,
on most occasions, amazingly frank in their conversations, and
made no concealment of their aims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In particular, Mr. Messersmith states that he had contact with
the following twenty governmental officials, among others: Hermann
Goering, General Milch, Hjalmar Schacht, Hans Frank,
Wilhelm Frick, Count Schwerin von Krosigk, Josef Goebbels,
Richard Walter Darré, Robert Ley, Hans Heinrich Lammers,
Otto Meissner, Franz von Papen, Walter Funk, General Wilhelm
Keitel, Admiral Erich von Raeder, Admiral Karl Doenitz, Dr.
Behle, Dr. Stuckart, Gustav Krupp von Bohlen, and Dr. Davidson.
Mr. Messersmith further states that in addition to this contact
with officials of the Government he maintained contact with
individuals in all parties in Germany in order to keep himself and
the Government informed of political developments in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the Austrian matter, he states that from the
very beginning of the Nazi Party he was told by both high and
secondary government officials in Germany that incorporation of
Austria into Germany was both a political and economic necessity
and that this incorporation was going to be accomplished
“by whatever means were necessary.” He further states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I can assert that it was fully understood by everyone in
Germany who had any knowledge whatever of what was going
on that Hitler, and the Nazi Government were irrevocably
committed to this end and the only doubt which ever existed
in conversations or statements to me was ‘how’ and ‘when.’ ”
(<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As Mr. Messersmith relates, at the beginning of the Nazi regime
in 1933 Germany was too weak to make open threats of force
against any country. It developed a policy of securing its aims
in Austria in the same manner as in Germany—by obtaining a
foothold in the Cabinet, particularly in the Ministry of Interior
which controls the police, and quickly eliminating the opposition
elements. Mr. Messersmith states that throughout his stay in
Austria he was told on any number of occasions by high officials
<span class='pageno' title='452' id='Page_452'></span>
of the Austrian Government, including Chancellor Dollfuss, Chancellor
Schuschnigg, and President Miklas, that the German Government
kept up constant pressure upon the Austrian Government
to appoint ministers with Nazi orientation.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Pressure Used, Including Terror and Intimidation, Culminating
in the Unsuccessful Putsch of 25 July 1934.</span> To achieve
their end the Nazis used various pressures. They used economic
pressure. The law of 24 March 1933 imposed a prohibitive 1,000
reichsmark penalty on trips to Austria, thus bringing hardship
to Austria, which relied heavily on its tourist trade (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>
1933, I, 311). The Nazis used propaganda. And they used
terroristic acts, primarily bombings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>) goes into some detail with
respect to these means. Although they were committed by National
Socialists in Austria, high Nazi officials in Germany admitted
to Mr. Messersmith that they were instigating and directing
these waves of terror in Austria. They made no effort to
conceal their use of terror, which they justified on the ground
that terror was a necessary instrument to impose the will of the
party not only in Germany but in other countries. Mr. Messersmith
recalls specifically that General Milch of the Air Force
stated that the terrorism in Austria was being directed by the
Nazi Party in Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Messersmith points out that all these outrages were a common
occurrence. They had peaks and distinct periods, one in mid-1933
and another in early 1934. He points out that the wave of
outrages in May and June 1934 diminished markedly for a few
days during the meeting of Hitler and Mussolini in Venice, in
mid-June 1934. (At that time Mussolini was strongly supporting
the Austrian Government and interested in its independence.) Mr.
Messersmith’s affidavit quotes extensively from dispatches sent
from the American Legation in Vienna to the State Department
during this period. These dispatches indicate that the terror was
often directed at Catholic Churches and institutions, and at railways
and tourist centers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Messersmith also recalls that in addition, the Nazis maintained
a threat of violent action against Austria through the “Austrian
Legion.” This was a para-military force of several thousand
men, armed by the Nazis in Germany, and stationed in Germany
near the Austrian border. It included Austrian Nazis who
fled from Austria after committing crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These terroristic activities of the Nazis in Austria continued
until July 25, 1934. On that day members of the NSDAP attempted
<span class='pageno' title='453' id='Page_453'></span>
a revolutionary putsch and killed Chancellor Dollfuss. A
message from Mr. Hadow, of the British Legation in Vienna, to
Sir John Simon contains details of the putsch (<span class='it'>2985-PS</span>). The
official version of events given verbally by the Austrian Government
to the diplomatic Corps, as set forth in this document, stated
that approximately a hundred men attempting the putsch seized
the Federal Chancellery. Chancellor Dollfuss was wounded in trying
to escape, being shot twice at close quarters. The Radio Building
in the center of the town was overwhelmed, and the announcer
was compelled to broadcast the news that Dollfuss had resigned
and Doctor Rintelen had taken his place as Chancellor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the putsch failed, the insurgents kept control of the
Chancellery Building and agreed to give it up only after they had
a safe-conduct to the German border. The insurgents contacted
the German Minister, Dr. Rieth, by telephone, and subsequently
had private negotiations with him in the building. At about 7:00
p. m. they yielded the building, but Chancellor Dollfuss died about
6:00 p. m., not having had the services of a doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Government denied all complicity in the putsch
and assassination. Hitler removed Dr. Rieth as Minister on the
ground that he had offered a safe-conduct to the rebels without
making inquiry of the German Government, and had thus without
any reason dragged the German Reich into an internal Austrian
affair. This statement appears in the letter which Hitler sent to
Franz von Papen on the 26th day of July 1934. (<span class='it'>2799-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the German Government denied any knowledge or
complicity in this putsch, there is ample basis for the conclusion
that the German Nazis bear responsibility for the events. Light
is shed on this matter in the extensive record of the trial of the
Austrian Nazi, Planetta, and others who were convicted for the
murder, and in the Austrian Brown Book issued after July 25.
Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit offers further evidence:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The events of the Putsch of July 25, 1934, are too well
known for me to repeat them in this statement. I need say
here only that there can be no doubt that the Putsch was
ordered and organized by the Nazi officials from Germany
through their organization in Austria made up of German
Nazis and Austrian Nazis. Dr. Rieth, the German Minister
in Vienna, was fully familiar with all that was going to happen
and that was being planned. The German Legation was
located directly across the street from the British Legation
and the Austrian secret police kept close watch on the persons
who entered the German Legation. The British had
their own secret service in Vienna at the time and they also
<span class='pageno' title='454' id='Page_454'></span>
kept a discreet surveillance over people entering the German
Legation. I was told by both British and Austrian officials
that a number of the men who were later found guilty by the
Austrian Courts of having been implicated in the Putsch had
frequented the German Legation. In addition, I personally
followed very closely the activities of Dr. Rieth and I never
doubted on the basis of all my information that Dr. Rieth
was in close touch and constant touch with the Nazi agents
in Austria; these agents being both German and Austrian.
Dr. Rieth could not have been unfamiliar with the Putsch
and the details in connection therewith. I recall too very
definitely from my conversations with the highest officials of
the Austrian Government after the Putsch, their informing
me that Dr. Rieth had been in touch with von Rintelen, who
it had been planned by the Nazis was to succeed Chancellor
Dollfuss had the Putsch been successful.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It may be that Dr. Rieth was himself not personally sympathetic
with the plans for the Putsch but there is no question
that he was fully familiar with all these plans and must have
given his assent thereto and connived therein.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As this Putsch was so important and was a definite attempt
to overthrow the Austrian Government and resulted in the
murder of the Chancellor of Austria, I took occasion to verify
at the time for myself various other items of evidence
indicating that the Putsch was not only made with the knowledge
of the German Government but engineered by it. I
found and verified that almost a month before the Putsch,
Goebbels told Signor Cerruti, the Italian Ambassador in
Berlin, that there would be a Nazi Government in Vienna
in a month.” (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. William Dodd, Ambassador of the United States to Germany,
published in 1941 his Diary, covering the years 1933-1938
(<span class='it'>2832-PS</span>). The diary contains an entry for July 26, 1934, which
makes the following observations. First, Ambassador Dodd noted
that in February, 1934, Ernst Hanfstaengl had advised him that
he had brought what was virtually an order from Mussolini to
Hitler to leave Austria alone and to dismiss and silence Theodor
Habicht, the German agent in Munich who had been agitating for
annexation of Austria. On 18 June, in Venice, Hitler was reported
to have promised Mussolini to leave Austria alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dodd further states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On Monday, July 23, after repeated bombings in Austria
by Nazis, a boat loaded with explosives was seized on Lake
Constance by the Swiss police. It was a shipment of German
<span class='pageno' title='455' id='Page_455'></span>
bombs and shells to Austria from some arms plant. That
looked ominous to me, but events of the kind had been so
common that I did not report it to Washington.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Today evidence came to my desk that last night, as late as
eleven o’clock, the government issued formal statements to
the newspapers rejoicing at the fall of Dollfuss and proclaiming
the Greater Germany that must follow. The German
Minister in Vienna had actually helped to form the new
Cabinet. He had, as we now know, exacted a promise that
the gang of Austrian Nazi murderers should be allowed to
go into Germany undisturbed. But it was realized about 12
o’clock that, although Dollfuss was dead, the loyal Austrians
had surrounded the government palace and prevented the
organization of a new Nazi regime. They held the murderers
prisoners. The German Propaganda Ministry therefore forbade
publication of the news sent out an hour before and
tried to collect all the releases that had been distributed. A
copy was brought to me today by a friend.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All the German papers this morning lamented the cruel
murder and declared that it was simply an attack of discontented
Austrians, not Nazis. News from Bavaria shows that
thousands of Austrian Nazis living for a year in Bavaria on
German support had been active for ten days before, some
getting across the border contrary to law, all drilling and
making ready to return to Austria. The German propagandist
Habicht was still making radio speeches about the necessity
of annexing the ancient realm of the Hapsburgs to the
Third Reich, in spite of all the promises of Hitler to silence
him. But now that the drive has failed and the assassins are
in prison in Vienna, the German Government denounces all
who say there was any support from Berlin.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I think it will be clear one day that millions of dollars and
many arms have been pouring into Austria since the spring
of 1933. Once more the whole world is condemning the
Hitler regime. No people in all modern history has been
quite so unpopular as Nazi Germany. This stroke completes
the picture. I expect to read a series of bitter denunciations
in the American papers when they arrive about ten days
from now.” (<span class='it'>2832-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with the German Government’s denial of any
connection with the putsch and the murder of Dollfuss, the letter
of appointment which Hitler wrote to Vice-Chancellor von Papen
on 26 July 1934 is significant. This letter appears in a standard
German reference work, <span class='it'>Dokumente der Deutschen Politik, II, Page 83</span>
<span class='pageno' title='456' id='Page_456'></span>
(<span class='it'>2799-PS</span>). (In considering the letter the report wide-spread
at the time should be recalled, that von Papen narrowly
missed being purged on 30 June, 1944, along with Ernst Roehm
and others.) The letter reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>“26 July 1934</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Dear Mr. von Papen</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As a result of the events in Vienna I am compelled to suggest
to the Reichs President the removal of the German Minister
to Vienna, Dr. Rieth, from his post, because he, at the
suggestion of Austrian Federal Ministers and the Austrian
rebels respectively consented to an agreement made by both
these parties concerning the safe conduct and retreat of the
rebels to Germany without making inquiry of the German
Reich Government. Thus the Minister has dragged the German
Reich into an internal Austrian affair without any
reason.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The assassination of the Austrian Federal Chancellor
which was strictly condemned and regretted by the German
Government has made the situation in Europe, already fluid,
more acute, without any fault of ours. Therefore, it is my
desire to bring about if possible an easing of the general
situation, and especially to direct the relations with the German
Austrian State, which have been so strained for a long
time, again into normal and friendly channels.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For this reason, I request you, dear Mr. von Papen, to take
over this important task, just because you have possessed
and continue to possess my most complete and unlimited confidence
ever since we have worked together in the Cabinet—</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore, I have suggested to the Reichs President that
you, upon leaving the Reich-Cabinet and upon release from
the office of Commissioner for the Saar, be called on special
mission to the post of the German Minister in Vienna for a
limited period of time. In this position you will be directly
subordinated to me.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Thanking you once more for all that you have at one time
done for the coordination of the Government of the National
Revolution and since then together with us for Germany, I
remain,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>Yours, very sincerely,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Adolf Hitler.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>(<span class='it'>2799-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Four years later, on July 25, 1938, after the Anschluss with
Austria, German officials no longer expressed regrets over the
death of Dollfuss. They were eager and willing to reveal what the
<span class='pageno' title='457' id='Page_457'></span>
world already knew—that they were identified with and sponsors
of the murder of the former Chancellor. A dispatch from the
American Consul General in Vienna to the Secretary of State,
dated July 26, 1938, relates to the Nazis’ celebration of the murder
of Dollfuss, held on July 24 and July 25, 1938, four years after
the event. It states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The two high points of the celebration were the memorial
assembly on the 24th at Klagenfurt, capital of the province
of Carinthia, where in 1934 the Vienna Nazi revolt found its
widest response, and the march on the 25th to the former
Federal Chancellery in Vienna by the surviving members of
the S.S. Standarte 89, which made the attack on the Chancellery
in 1934—a reconstruction of the crime, so to say.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The assembled thousands at Klagenfurt were addressed by
the Fuehrer’s deputy, Rudolf Hess, in the presence of the
families of the 13 National Socialists who were hanged for
their part in the July putsch. The Klagenfurt memorial celebration
was also made the occasion for the solemn swearing
in of the seven recently appointed Gauleiters of the Ostmark.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“From the point of view of the outside world, the speech of
Reichs Minister Hess was chiefly remarkable for the fact
that after devoting the first half of his speech to the expected
praise of the sacrifices of the men, women and youths of
Austria in the struggle for a greater Germany, he then
launched into a defense of the occupation of Austria and an
attack on the ‘lying foreign press’ and on those who spread
the idea of a new war. The world was fortunate, declared
Hess, that Germany’s leader was a man who would not allow
himself to be provoked. ‘The Fuehrer does what is necessary
for his people in sovereign calm. * * * and labors for
the peace of Europe’ even though provocators, ‘completely
ignoring the deliberate threat to peace of certain small
states,’ deceitfully claim that he is a menace to the peace of
Europe.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The march on the former Federal Chancellery, now the
Reichsstatthalterei, followed the exact route and time schedule
of the original attack. The marchers were met at the
Chancellery by the Reichsstatthalter Seyss-Inquart, who
addressed them and unveiled a memorial tablet. From the
Reichsstatthalterei the Standarte marched to the old RAVAG
broadcasting center from which false news of the
resignation of Dollfuss had been broadcast, and there unveiled
a second memorial tablet. Steinhausl, the present
Police President of Vienna, is a member of the S. S. Standarte
89”. (<span class='it'>L-273</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='458' id='Page_458'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The original plaque is now rubble. But a photograph of it
was found in The National Library in Vienna. [The photograph
was offered in evidence at the trial. See <span class='it'>2968-PS</span>.] The plaque
reads: “154 German men of 89 SS Standarte stood up here for
Germany on July 26, 1934. Seven found death at the hands of the
hangman”. The words chosen for this marble tablet, and it may
be presumed that they were words chosen carefully, reveal clearly
that the men involved were not mere malcontent Austrian revolutionaries,
but were regarded as German men, were members
of a para-military organization, who stood up here “for Germany.”
In 1934 Hitler repudiated Dr. Rieth because he “dragged the German
Reich into an internal Austrian affair without any reason”.
In 1938 Nazi Germany proudly identified itself with this murder,
took credit for it, and took responsibility for it.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Program Culminating in the Pact of July 11, 1936.</span>
In considering the activities of the Nazi conspirators in Austria
between 25 July 1934 and November 1937, there is a distinct
intermediate point, the Pact of 11 July 1936. Accordingly, developments
in the two-year period, July 1934 to July 1936, will first
be reviewed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Continued Aim of Eliminating Austria’s Independence—Conversation
and Activities of von Papen.</span> The Nazi conspirators
pretended to respect the independence and sovereignty of
Austria, notwithstanding the aim of Anschluss stated in <span class='it'>Mein
Kampf</span>. But in truth and in fact they were working from the very
beginning to destroy the Austrian State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dramatic recital of the position of von Papen in this regard
is provided in Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit. It states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When I did call on von Papen in the German Legation, he
greeted me with ‘Now you are in my Legation and I can control
the conversation.’ In the baldest and most cynical manner
he then proceeded to tell me that all of Southeastern
Europe, to the borders of Turkey, was Germany’s natural
hinterland, and that he had been charged with the mission of
facilitating German economic and political control over all
this region for Germany. He blandly and directly said that
getting control of Austria was to be the first step. He definitely
stated that he was in Austria to undermine and
weaken the Austrian Government and from Vienna to work
towards the weakening of the Governments in the other
states to the South and Southeast. He said that he intended
to use his reputation as a good Catholic to gain influence
with certain Austrians, such as Cardinal Innitzer, towards
<span class='pageno' title='459' id='Page_459'></span>
that end. He said that he was telling me this because the
German Government was bound on this objective of getting
this control of Southeastern Europe and there was nothing
which could stop it and that our own policy and that of
France and England was not realistic.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The circumstances were such, as I was calling on him in the
German Legation, that I had to listen to what he had to say
and of course I was prepared to hear what he had to say
although I already knew what his instructions were. I was
nevertheless shocked to have him speak so baldly to me and
when he finished I got up and told him how shocked I was
to hear the accredited representative of a supposedly
friendly state to Austria admit that he was proposing to engage
in activities to undermine and destroy that Government
to which he was accredited. He merely smiled and said, of
course this conversation was between us and that he would
of course, not be talking to others so clearly about his objectives.
I have gone into this detail with regard to this conversation
as it is characteristic of the absolute frankness and
directness with which high Nazi officials spoke of their
objectives.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On the surface, however, German activities consisted principally
of efforts to win the support of prominent and influential
men through insidious efforts of all kinds, including
the use of the German Diplomatic Mission in Vienna and its
facilities and personnel. Von Papen as German Minister
entertained frequently and on a lavish scale. He approached
almost every member of the Austrian Cabinet, telling them,
as several of them later informed me, that Germany was
bound to prevail in the long run and that they should join
the winning side if they wished to enjoy positions of power
and influence under German control. Of course, openly and
outwardly he gave solemn assurance that Germany would
respect Austrian independence and that all that she wished
to do was to get rid of elements in the Austrian Government
like the Chancellor, Schuschnigg and Starhemberg as head
of the Heimwehr and others, and replace them by a few
‘nationally-minded’ Austrians, which of course meant Nazis.
The whole basic effort of von Papen was to bring about
Anschluss.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In early 1935, the Austrian Foreign Minister, Berger-Waldenegg,
informed me that in the course of a conversation
with von Papen, the latter had remarked ‘Yes, you have your
<span class='pageno' title='460' id='Page_460'></span>
French and English friends now and you can have your independence
a little longer’. The Foreign Minister, of course,
told me this remark in German but the foregoing is an accurate
translation. The Foreign Minister told me that he had
replied to von Papen ‘I am glad to have from your own lips
your own opinion which agrees with what your Chief has
just said in the Saar and which you have taken such pains
to deny.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Von Papen undoubtedly achieved some successes, particularly
with men like Glaise-Horstenau and others who had
long favored the ‘Grossdeutschum’ idea, but who nevertheless
had been greatly disturbed by the fate of the Catholic
Church. Without conscience or scruple, von Papen exploited
his reputation and that of his wife as ardent and devout
Catholics to overcome the fears of these Austrians in this
respect.” (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Continued Existence of Nazi Organizations with a Program
of Armed Preparedness.</span> The wiles of von Papen represented
only one part of the total program of the Nazi conspiracy. At
the same time Nazi activities in Austria, forced underground
during this period, were carried on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit discloses the following: The Nazi
organization, weakened in the events following the putsch, began
reorganization work. An informant furnished the Austrian Government
with a memorandum of a meeting of Austrian Nazi
chiefs held in Bavaria, September, 1934. The memorandum shows
that they agreed to prepare for new terroristic acts, to proceed
brutally against persons cooperating with the Schuschnigg Government
when the next action against the Government took place,
and to appear disposed to negotiate but to arm for the struggle.
A copy of this memorandum was furnished to Mr. Messersmith.
At the same time the Austrian Legion was kept in readiness in
Germany. This large, organized hostile group constituted a continuing
menace for Austria. (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact of the reorganization of the Nazi party in Austria is
corroborated by a report of one of the Austrian Nazis, Rainer
(<span class='it'>812-PS</span>). (<span class='it'>812-PS</span> contains three parts. First there is a letter
dated 22 August 1939 from Rainer, then Gauleiter at Salzburg,
to Seyss-Inquart, then Reich Minister. That letter encloses
a letter dated 6 July 1939, written by Rainer to Reich Commissioner
and Gauleiter Josef Buerckel. In that letter, in turn, Rainer
inclosed a report on the events in the NSDAP of Austria from
1933 to 11 March 1938, the day before the invasion of Austria.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter from Rainer to Buerckel indicates that he was asked
<span class='pageno' title='461' id='Page_461'></span>
to prepare a short history of the role of the party. He states that
after the Anschluss Hitler and the general public gave Seyss-Inquart
alone credit for effecting the Anschluss. It is Rainer’s belief
that credit belongs to the entire Party, the leaders of which had
to remain underground. And so Rainer writes his report to show
that the Party as a whole is entitled to “the glory which was
excessively ascribed to one person, Dr. Seyss-Inquart”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently Seyss-Inquart heard from Buerckel what Rainer
said, and wrote to Rainer asking for an explanation. To avoid
misunderstanding, Rainer prepared for Seyss-Inquart a copy of
his letter to Buerckel and his report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rainer report tells of the disorganization of the Nazi party
in Austria and of its reconstitution. The second and third paragraphs
of the report state:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Thus the first stage of battle commenced which ended with
the July rising of 1934. The decision for the July rising was
right, the execution of it was faulty. The result was a complete
destruction of the organization; the loss of entire
groups of fighters through imprisonment or flight into the
‘Alt-Reich’; and with regard to the political relationship of
Germany to Austria, a formal acknowledgment of the existence
of the Austrian State by the German Government.
With the telegram to PAPEN, instructing him to reinstitute
normal relationships between the two states, the Fuehrer
had liquidated the first stage of the battle; and a new method
of political penetration was to begin. By order of the Fuehrer
the Landesleitung Munich was dissolved, and the party
in Austria was left to its own resources.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“There was no acknowledged leader for the entire party in
Austria. New leaderships were forming in the nine Gaus.
The process was again and again interrupted by the interference
of the police; there was no liaison between the formations,
and frequently there were two, three or more rival
leaderships. The first evident, acknowledged speaker of
almost all the Gaus in Autumn 1934 was engineer REINTHALLER
(already appointed Landesbauernfeuhrer (leader
of the country’s farmers) by Hess). He endeavored to
bring about a political appeasement by negotiations with the
government, with the purpose of giving the NSDAP legal
status again, thus permitting its political activities. Simultaneously
Reinthaller started the reconstruction of the illegal
political organization, at the head of which he had
placed engineer NEUBACHER.” (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Secret Contacts Between German Officials, Including
<span class='pageno' title='462' id='Page_462'></span>
Papen, and the Austrian Nazis: the Use by the Austrian
Nazis of “Front” Personalities.</span> Two cardinal factors about the
Nazi organization in Austria should be borne in mind. First,
although the Fuehrer had on the surface cast the Austrian Nazis
adrift, in fact German officials, including Papen, maintained secret
contact with the Austrian Nazis, in line with Hitler’s desires.
German officials consulted and gave advice and support to the
organization of the Austrian Nazis. In the second place, the
Austrian Nazis remained an illegal organization, organizing for
the eventual use of force in an “emergency.” But in the meanwhile
they deemed it expedient to act behind “front” personalities,
such as Seyss-Inquart, who had no apparent taint of illegality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Messersmith relates in his affidavit that he obtained a copy
of a document outlining this Nazi program.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For two years following the failure of the July 25 Putsch,
the Nazis remained relatively quiet in Austria. Very few
terroristic acts occurred during the remainder of 1934 and as
I recall in 1935 and most of 1936; this inactivity was in accordance
with directives from Berlin as direct evidence to
that effect, which came to my knowledge at that time,
proved. Early in January, the Austrian Foreign Minister,
Berger-Waldenegg, furnished me a document which I considered
accurate in all respects and which stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>‘The German Minister here, von Papen, on the occasion
of his last visit to Berlin, was received three times by
Chancellor Hitler for fairly long conversations, and he
also took this opportunity to call on Schacht and von Neurath.
In these conversations the following instructions
were given to him:</p>

<p class='noindent'>‘During the next two years nothing can be undertaken
which will give Germany external political difficulties. On
this ground, everything must be avoided which could
awaken the appearance of Germany interfering in the
internal affairs of Austria. Chancellor Hitler will, therefore,
also for this reason not endeavor to intervene in the
present prevailing difficult crisis in the National Socialist
Party in Austria, although he is convinced that
order could be brought into the Party at once through a
word from him. This word, however, he will, for foreign
political reasons, give all the less, as he is convinced that
the, for him, desirable ends may be reached also in another
way. Naturally, Chancellor Hitler declared to the German
Minister here, this does not indicate any disinterestedness
in the idea of Austria’s independence. Also, before everything,
<span class='pageno' title='463' id='Page_463'></span>
Germany cannot for the present withdraw Party
members in Austria, and must, therefore, in spite of the
very real exchange difficulties, make every effort to bring
help to the persecuted National Socialist sufferers in
Austria. As a result, Minister of Commerce Schacht
finally gave the authorization that from then on 200,000
marks a month were to be set aside for this end (support
of National Socialists in Austria). The control and the
supervision of this monthly sum was to be entrusted to
Engineer Reinthaller, who, through the fact that he alone
had control over the money, would have a definite influence
on the Party followers. In this way it would be possible to
end most quickly and most easily the prevailing difficulties
and division in the Austrian National Socialist Party.</p>

<p class='noindent'>‘The hope was also expressed to Herr von Papen that
the recently authorized foundation of German “Ortsgruppen”
of the National Socialist Party in Austria
(made up of German citizens in Austria) would be so
arranged as not to give the appearance that Germany is
planning to interfere in Austrian internal affairs.’ ”
(<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The report of Gauleiter Rainer to Reichskommissar Buerckel
in July 1939, outlines the further history of the party and the
leadership squabbles following the retirement of Reinthaller. In
referring to the situation in 1935, he mentions some of the contacts
with the Reich Government in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In August some further arrests took place, the victims of
which were, apart from the Gauleaders, also Globocnik and
Rainer. SCHATTENFROH then claimed, because of an
instruction received from the imprisoned LEOPOLD, to have
been made deputy country leader. A group led by engineer
RAFFELSBERGER had at this time also established connections
with departments of the Alt-Reich (Ministry of
Propaganda, German Racial Agency, etc.) and made an attempt
to formulate a political motto in the form of a program
for the fighting movement of Austria.” (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Rainer report sets forth the situation a little later in 1936:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The principles of the construction of the organization were:
The organization is the bearer of the illegal fight and the
trustee of the idea to create a secret organization, in a simple
manner, and without compromise, according to the principle
of organizing an elite to be available to the illegal land-party
council upon any emergency. Besides this, all political opportunities
should be taken and all legal people and legal
<span class='pageno' title='464' id='Page_464'></span>
chances should be used without revealing any ties with the
illegal organization. Therefore, cooperation between the
illegal party organization and the legal political aides was
anchored at the top of the party leadership. All connections
with the party in Germany were kept secret in accordance
with the orders of the Fuehrer. These said that the German
state should officially be omitted from the creation of an
Austrian NSDAP; and that auxiliary centers for propaganda,
press, refugees, welfare, etc. should be established in
the foreign countries bordering Austria.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Hinterleitner already contacted the lawyer Seyss-Inquart,
who had connections with Dr. Wachter which originated
from Seyss-Inquart’s support of the July uprising. On the
other side Seyss-Inquart had a good position in the legal field
and especially well-established relations with Christian-Social
politicians. Dr. Seyss-Inquart came from the ranks of
the ‘Styrian Heimatschutz’ and became a party member
when the entire ‘Styrian Heimatschutz’ was incorporated
into the NSDAP. Another personality who had a good position
in the legal field was Col. Glaise-Horstenau who had
contacts with both sides. The agreement of 11 July 1936 was
strongly influenced by the activities of these two persons. Papen
mentioned Glaise-Horstenau to the Fuehrer as being a
trusted person.” (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Rainer report thus discloses the dual tactics of the Austrian
Nazis during this period of keeping quiet and awaiting
developments. They were maintaining their secret contacts with
Reich officials, and using “front” personalities such as Glaise-Horstenau
and Seyss-Inquart. The Nazis made good use of such
figures, who were more discreet in their activities and could be
referred to as “Nationalists”. They presented, supported, and
obtained consideration of demands which could not be negotiated
by out-and-out Nazis like Captain Leopold. Seyss-Inquart did
not hold any public office until January 1937, when he was
made Councillor of State. But Rainer, describing him as a
trustworthy member of the Party through the ranks of the
Styrian Heimatschutz, points him out as one who strongly influenced
the agreement of 11 July 1936.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the Nazis, but not the Austrian Government, did well to
trust Seyss-Inquart, is indicated by a letter, dated 14 July 1939,
addressed to Field Marshal Goering (<span class='it'>2219-PS</span>). The letter ends
with the “Heil Hitler” close and is not signed, but it was undoubtedly
written by Seyss-Inquart. It was found among Seyss-Inquart’s
personal files. On the first page of the letter there
<span class='pageno' title='465' id='Page_465'></span>
appears a note in ink, not indicated in the partial English translation,
reading: “Air Mail. 15 July, 1515 hours, Berlin, brought
to Goering’s office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main text of the letter consists of a plea for intercession
in behalf of one Muehlmann, who unfortunately got in Buerckel’s
bad graces. An extract from the letter, which shows Seyss-Inquart
as one whose loyalty to Hitler and the aims of the Nazi
conspiracy led him to fight for the Anschluss with all the means
at his disposal, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>At Present In Vienna, 14 July 1939</p>

<p class='noindent'>“To the General Field Marshal</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If I may add something about myself, it is the following: I
know that I am not of an active fighting nature, unless final
decisions are at stake. At this time of pronounced activism
(<span class='it'>Aktivismus</span>) this will certainly be regarded as a fault in
my personality. Yet I know that I cling with unconquerable
tenacity to the goal in which I believe. That is Greater Germany
(<span class='it'>Grossdeutschland</span>) and the FUEHRER. And if some
people are already tired out from the struggle and some have
been killed in the fight, I am still around somewhere and
ready to go into action. This, after all, was also the development
until the year 1938. Until July 1934 I conducted myself
as a regular member of the party. And if I had quietly,
in whatever form, paid my membership dues the first one,
according to a receipt, I paid in December 1931. I probably
would have been an undisputed, comparatively old fighter
and party member of Austria, but I would not have done
any more for the union. I told myself in July 1934 that we
must fight this clerical regime on its own ground in order to
give the Fuehrer a chance to use whatever method he desires.
I told myself that this Austria was worth a mass. I have
stuck to this attitude with an iron determination because I
and my friends had to fight against the whole political
church, the Freemasonry, the Jewry, in short, against everything
in Austria. The slightest weakness which we might
have displayed would undoubtedly have led to our political
annihilation; it would have deprived the Fuehrer of the
means and tools to carry out his ingenious political solution
for Austria, as became evident in the days of March 1938.
I have been fully conscious of the fact that I am following a
path which is not comprehensible to the masses and also not
to my party comrades. I followed it calmly and would without
<span class='pageno' title='466' id='Page_466'></span>
hesitation follow it again because I am satisfied that at
one point I could serve the FUEHRER as a tool in his work,
even though my former attitude even now gives occasion to
very worthy and honorable party comrades to doubt my
trustworthiness. I have never paid attention to such things
because I am satisfied with the opinion which the FUEHRER
and the men close to him have of me.” (<span class='it'>2210-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A letter from Papen to Hitler dated 27 July 1935 shows how
Papen thought the doctrines of National Socialism could be used
to effect the aim of Anschluss. It consists of a report entitled
“Review and Outlook, One Year after the Death of Chancellor
Dollfuss.” After reviewing the success that the Austrian Government
had had in establishing Dollfuss as a martyr and his
principles as the patriotic principles of Austria, Papen stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“National Socialism must and will overpower the new
Austrian ideology. If today it is contended in Austria that
the NSDAP is only a centralized Reich German party and
therefore unable to transfer the spirit of thought of National
Socialism to groups of people of a different political make-up,
the answer must rightly be that the national revolution in
Germany could not have been brought about in a different
way. But when the creation of the people’s community in
the Reich will be completed, National socialism could, in a
much wider sense than this is possible through the present
party organization—at least apparently—, certainly become
the rallying point for all racially German units beyond the
borders. Spiritual progress in regard to Austria cannot be
achieved today with any centralized tendency. If this recognition
would once and for all be stated clearly from within
the Reich, then it would easily become possible to effect a
breakthrough into the front of the New Austria. A Nurnberg
Party Day designated as ‘The German Day’ as in old
times and the proclamation of a national socialistic peoples’
front, would be a stirring event for all beyond the borders of
the Reich. Such attacks would win us also the particularistic
Austrian circles, whose spokesman, the legitimistic Count
Dubsky wrote in his pamphlet about the ‘Anschluss’: The
Third Reich will be with Austria, or it will not be at all. National
Socialism must win it or it will perish, if it is unable
to solve this task * * *.” (<span class='it'>2248-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Other reports from Papen to Hitler, hereinafter mentioned,
show that he maintained covert contact with the National Socialist
groups in Austria. From the very start of his mission Papen was
thinking of ways and means of using the principle of National
<span class='pageno' title='467' id='Page_467'></span>
Socialism for “National Germans” outside the borders of Germany.
Papen was working for Anschluss, and although he preferred
to use the principles of National Socialism rather than
rely on the party organization, he was prepared to defend the
party organization as a necessary means of establishing those
principles in the German Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>Assurances and Reassurances.</span> The German Government
did more than keep up a pretense of noninterference with Austrian
groups. It employed the psychological inducement of providing
assurances that it had no designs on Austria’s independence.
If Austria could but hope for the execution of those assurances,
she could find her way clear to the granting of concessions,
and obtain relief from the economic and internal pressures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A letter from Papen, while in Berlin, to Hitler, dated 17 May
1935, indicated that a forthright, credible statement by Germany
reassuring Austria would be most useful for German diplomatic
purposes and the improvement of relationships between Austria
and German groups in Austria (<span class='it'>2247-PS</span>). Papen had a scheme
for pitting Schuschnigg and his Social-Christian forces against
Starhemberg, the Vice-Chancellor of Austria, who was backed
by Mussolini. He hoped to persuade Schuschnigg to ally his
forces with the NSDAP in order to emerge victorious over Starhemberg.
Papen indicated that he obtained this idea from Captain
Leopold, leader of the illegal National Socialists. His letter
states in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * I suggest that we take an active part in this
game. The fundamental idea should be to pit Schuschnigg
and his Christian-social Forces, who are opposed to a home
front dictatorship, against Starhemberg. The possibility of
thwarting the measures arranged between Mussolini and
Starhemberg should be afforded to him, in such way that
he would submit the offer to the government of a definitive
German-Austrian compromise of interests. According to the
convincing opinion of the leader of the NSDAP in Austria,
Capt. Leopold, the totalitarian principle of the NSDAP in
Austria must be replaced in the beginning by a combination
of that part of the Christian-elements which favors the
Greater Germany idea and the NSDAP. If Germany recognizes
the national independence of Austria and guarantees
full freedom to the Austrian national opposition, then as a
result of such a compromise the Austrian government would
be formed in the beginning by a coalition of these forces. A
further consequence of this step would be the possibility of
the participation of Germany in the Danube pact, which
<span class='pageno' title='468' id='Page_468'></span>
would take the sting out of its acuteness due to the settlement
of relations between Germany and Austria. Such a
measure would have a most beneficial influence on the European
situation and especially on our relationship with England.
One may object, that Mr. Schuschnigg will hardly be
determined to follow such a pattern, that he will rather in
all probability immediately communicate our offer to our
opponents. Of course, one should first of all explore the possibility
of setting Schuschnigg against Starhemberg through
the use of ‘Go betweens’. The possibility exists. If Mr.
Schuschnigg finally says ‘No’ and makes our offer known in
Rome, then the situation would not be any worse but, on the
contrary, the efforts of the Reich government to make peace
with Austria would be revealed—without prejudice to other
interests. Therefore even in the case of refusal this last
attempt would be an asset. I consider it completely possible,
that in view of the far spread dislike of the Alpine countries
of the pro-Italian course and in view of the sharp tensions
within the federal government (<span class='it'>Bundesregierung</span>), Mr.
Schuschnigg will grasp this last straw—always under the
supposition that the offer could not be interpreted as a trap
by the opponents, but that it bears all the mark of an actually
honest compromise with Austria. Assuming success of
this step, we would again establish our active intervention
in Central European politics, which, as opposed to the
French-Czech and Russian political maneuvers, would be a
tremendous success, both morally and practically. Since
there are 2 weeks left to accomplish very much work in the
way of explorations and Conferences, an immediate decision
is necessary. The Reich Army Minister (<span class='it'>Reichswehrminister</span>)
shares the opinion presented above and the Reich
Foreign Minister (<span class='it'>Reichsaussenminister</span>) wanted to discuss
it with you my Fuehrer.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Papen”. (<span class='it'>2247-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, Papen wanted a strong assurance and credible
assurance, of Austria’s independence. As he put it, Germany had
nothing to lose with what it could always call a mere effort at
peace. And she might be able to convince Schuschnigg to establish
an Austrian coalition government with the NSDAP. If she
did this, she would vastly strengthen her position in Europe.
Finally, Papen urged haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exactly four days later (21 May 1935) in a Reichstag address
Hitler responded to Papen’s suggestion, asserting:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany neither intends nor wishes to interfere in the
<span class='pageno' title='469' id='Page_469'></span>
internal affairs of Austria, to annex Austria or to conclude
an Anschluss”. (<span class='it'>TC-26</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Despite this assurance, Papen suggested and Hitler announced,
for a complexity of reasons, a policy completely at variance with
their intentions, which had been and continued to be to interfere
in Austria’s internal affairs and to conclude an Anschluss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) <span class='it'>Temporary Continuance of a Quiet Pressure Policy.</span> On
1 May 1936 Hitler branded as a lie any statement that tomorrow
or the day after Germany would fall upon Austria. His words
were published in the <span class='it'>Voelkische-Beobachter</span>, SD, 2-3 May 1936,
p. 2. (<span class='it'>2367-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Hitler meant what he said, it was only in the most literal
and misleading sense that he would not fall upon Austria “tomorrow
or the day after”. For the conspirators well knew that the
successful execution of their purpose required for a while longer
the quiet policy they had been pursuing in Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A memorandum of a conversation which occurred when William
Bullitt, American Ambassador to France, called upon von
Neurath, German Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 18 May 1936,
recounts von Neurath’s explanation why Germany was trying to
prevent rather than encourage an outbreak by the Nazis in Austria
(<span class='it'>L-150</span>). The Nazis were growing stronger in Austria, anyway,
in view of their appeal to the young people. And the German
Government was doing nothing active in foreign affairs until the
Rhineland, reoccupied two months before, had been “digested”,
and until fortifications were constructed on the French frontier.
Finally, Italy still had a conflicting interest in Austria, and Germany
wished to avoid any involvement with Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>f</span>) <span class='it'>The agreement of 11 July 1936.</span> But if Germany was not
yet ready for open conflict in Austria, its diplomatic position was
vastly improved over 1934, a fact which influenced Austria’s willingness
to make concessions to Germany and come to terms. As
Mr. Messersmith points out, Italy, formerly a protector of Austria,
had embarked on her Abyssinian adventure, and this, together
with the refortification of the Rhineland, strengthened
Germany’s position (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>). This weakening of Austria
helped pave the way for the Pact of 11 July 1936. (<span class='it'>TC-22</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The formal part of the agreement of July 11, 1936, between the
German Government and the Government of the Federal State of
Austria, looks like a great triumph for Austria. It contains a
confusing provision to the effect that Austria, in its policy, especially
with regard to Germany, will regard herself as a German
state. But the other two provisions clearly state that Germany
recognizes the full sovereignty of Austria, and that it regards
<span class='pageno' title='470' id='Page_470'></span>
the inner political order of Austria (including the question of
Austrian National Socialism) as an internal concern of Austria
upon which it will exercise neither direct nor indirect influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was much more substance to the day’s events. Mr.
Messersmith’s summary, as set forth in his affidavit, is more
revealing:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Even more important than the terms of the agreement published
in the official communique, was the contemporaneous
informal understanding, the most important provisions
of which were, that Austria would (1) appoint a number of
individuals enjoying the Chancellor’s confidence but friendly
to Germany to positions in the Cabinet; (2) would devise
means to give the ‘national opposition’ a role in the political
life of Austria and within the framework of the Patriotic
Front, and (3) would amnesty all Nazis save those convicted
of the most serious offenses. This amnesty was duly announced
by the Austrian Government and thousands of
Nazis were released, and the first penetration of the <span class='it'>Deutsche
Nationaler</span> into the Austrian Government was accomplished
by the appointment of Dr. Guido Schmidt as Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, and of Dr. Edmund Glaise-Horstenau
as Minister Without Portfolio”. (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These and other provisions of the secret part of the Agreement
of July 11 are set forth briefly and in general terms in an affidavit
by Kurt Schuschnigg, former Chancellor of Austria, dated November
19, 1945 (<span class='it'>2994-PS</span>). By two of those provisions Austria
agreed to permit Nazi organizations on Austrian soil, and also
use of the swastika and singing of the Horst Wessel song—all
for German subjects. On its credit side, Austria was to get
repeal of the 1,000 mark barrier on tourist trade, and in general
tourist trade between the two countries was to resume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the strategy and tactics of the Nazis, these were
substantial concessions made by Austria to obtain Germany’s
diplomatic, formal assurance of Austrian independence and non-intervention
in Austrian internal affairs. The release of imprisoned
Nazis to the community presented potential police problems.
And as Mr. Messersmith pointed out in a 1934 dispatch, quoted
in his affidavit, any prospect that the National Socialists might
come to power would make it more difficult to obtain effective
police and judicial action against the Nazis for fear of reprisals
by the future Nazi Government against those taking action
against Nazis even in the line of duty (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>). The preservation
of internal peace in Austria was thus dependent upon Germany’s
living up to its obligations under the Accord.

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Germany’s Instructions to the Austrian National Socialists
Concerning Future Plans.</span> In the pact of 11 July 1936 Germany
agreed not to influence directly or indirectly the internal
affairs of Austria, including the matter of Austrian National
Socialism. On 16 July 1936, just five days later, Hitler violated
that provision. The report of Gauleiter Rainer to Reich Commissioner
Buerckel states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * At that time the Fuehrer wished to see the
leaders of the party in Austria in order to tell them his opinion
on what Austrian National Socialists should do. Meanwhile
Hinterleitner was arrested, and Dr. Rainer became his
successor and leader of the Austrian party. On 16 July 1936,
Dr. Rainer and Globocnik visited the Fuehrer at the ‘Obersalzburg’
where they received a clear explanation of the
situation and the wishes of the Fuehrer. On 17 July 1936,
all illegal Gauleiters met in Anif near Salzburg, where they
received a complete report from Rainer on the statement of
the Fuehrer and his political instructions for carrying out
the fight. At the same conference the Gauleiters received
organizational instructions from Globocnik and Hiedler.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Upon the proposal of Globocnik, the Fuehrer named Lt.
Gen. (Gruppenfuehrer) Keppler as chief of the mixed commission
which was appointed, in accordance with the state
treaty of 11 July 1936, to supervise the correct execution of
the agreement. At the same time Keppler was given full
authority by the Fuehrer for the party in Austria. After
Keppler was unsuccessful in his efforts to cooperate with
Leopold, he worked together with Dr. Rainer, Globocnik,
Reinthaller as leader of the peasants, Kaltenbrunner as
leader of the SS, and Dr. Jury as deputy-leader of the Austrian
party, as well as with Glaise-Horstenau and Seyss-Inquart.”
(<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A new strategy was developed for the Austrian Nazis. Mr.
Messersmith describes it briefly in his affidavit:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The sequel of the agreement was the only one which could
have been expected in view of all the facts and previous
recorded happenings. Active Nazi operations in Austria
were resumed under the leadership; of a certain Captain
Leopold, who it was known definitely was in frequent touch
with Hitler. The Nazi program was now to form an organization
through which the Nazis could carry on their operations
<span class='pageno' title='472' id='Page_472'></span>
openly and with legal sanction in Austria. There were
formed in Austria several organizations which had a legal
basis but which were simply a device by which the Nazis in
Austria could organize, and later seek inclusion as a unit in
the Patriotic Front. The most important of these was the
<span class='it'>Ostmarkischer Verein</span>, the sponsor of which was the Minister
of the Interior Glaise-Horstenau. Through the influence
of Glaise-Horstenau and the pro-Nazi Neustadter-Sturmer,
this organization was declared legal by the Courts. I
made specific mention of the foregoing because it shows the
degree to which the situation in Austria had disintegrated
as a result of the underground and open Nazi activities directed
from Germany.” (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A report from Papen to Hitler dated 1 September 1936 indicates
Papen’s strategy after 11 July 1936 for destroying Austria’s
independence. Papen had taken a substantial step forward
with the agreement of July 11. Incidentally, after that agreement
he was promoted from Minister to Ambassador. Now his
tactics were developed in the following terms, as explained in
the last three paragraphs of his letter of September 1:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The progress of normalizing relations with
Germany at the present time is obstructed by the continued
persistence of the Ministry of Security, occupied by the old
anti-National Socialistic officials. Changes in personnel are
therefore of utmost importance. But they are definitely not
to be expected prior to the conference on the abolishing of
the Control of Finances (Finanzkontrolle) at Geneva. The
Chancellor of the League has informed Minister de Glaise-Horstenau,
of his intention, to offer him the portfolio of
the Ministry of the Interior. As a guiding principle
(Marschroute) I recommend on the tactical side, continued,
patient psychological treatment, with slowly intensified pressure
directed at changing the regime. The proposed conference
on economic relations, taking place at the end of October,
will be a very useful tool for the realization of some of
our projects. In discussion with government officials as
well as with leaders of the illegal party (Leopold and Schattenfroh)
who conform completely with the agreement of
July 11. I am trying to direct the next developments in such
a manner to aim at corporative representation of the movement
in the fatherland front (Vaterlaendischen Front) but
nevertheless refraining from putting National Socialists in
important positions for the time being. However such positions
are to be occupied only by personalities, having the
<span class='pageno' title='473' id='Page_473'></span>
support and the confidence of the movement. I have a willing
collaborator in this respect in Minister Glaise-Horstenau.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To recapitulate, this report of von Papen, discloses the following
plans:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>1.</span><p class='listPara'>obtaining a change in personnel in Ministry of Security
in due course;</p>

positions yet, but using “nationalist” personalities;</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>4.</span><p class='listPara'>using economic pressure, and “patient psychological
treatment, with slowly intensified pressure directed at
changing the regime.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Nazi Demands and Demonstrations.</span> The Nazi demanded
even more open recognition. In January 1937 Captain
Leopold submitted a memorandum of demands. They are listed in
Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>). They were not formally
received by the Austrian Cabinet, but they were known to and
considered by the Cabinet. They included the following demands:
(1) An amnesty for all punishments or privations suffered for
National Socialist or National activity or sympathy; (2) equal
treatment for National Socialists, including freedom of political
activity and cultural activity; (3) abolition of laws and sanctions
used by the Government against Nazi activity. The memorandum
advocated cooperation on the basis of political principles including:
A broadening of the Patriotic Front; changes in the Cabinet;
an alliance with the Reich; common racial stock as a political
aim; the application of anti-Semitic measures; and an early
plebiscite on Anschluss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit also states that these demands, and
Leopold’s petition for a nationalistic party, were supported by
frequent demonstrations and much propaganda work. As early
as 29 July 1936, when the Olympic Torch was carried through
Vienna, there were violent Nazi disorders. From that time on
there were frequent arrests for distributing illegal literature or
staging illegal demonstrations. (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Schuschnigg’s Concessions.</span> Gauleiter Rainer’s historical
review points out that due to the activities of the Reich officials
and the Austrians who acted as the Nazi “fronts”, it was possible
to obtain the appointment of Seyss-Inquart as <span class='it'>Staatsrat</span>
(Councillor of State) in July, 1937. (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schuschnigg’s affidavit mentions the Olympic Torch incident,
<span class='pageno' title='474' id='Page_474'></span>
and in addition the demonstration of the illegal Nazis at the time
of the visit of von Neurath to Vienna in February 1937. Schuschnigg
also points out other examples of the pressure increasingly
exerted by Germany on Austria. One of his main reasons
for entering into the July 11 agreement was to eliminate Germany’s
1,000 mark penalty on tourists to Austria. The penalty
was removed, but Germany made it illegal for a tourist to bring
more than 5 marks out of the country. And German buyers of
cattle and wood purchased only from Austrian Nazis. (<span class='it'>2994-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schuschnigg further reports that the incidents and pressure
culminated in the so-called Tavs Plan, discovered by the Austrian
police in November, 1937, containing instructions for unrest to
break out among the Nazis at a prearranged time. The German
Government would submit an ultimatum that National Socialists
must be brought into the Government or the German Army
would invade. (<span class='it'>2994-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be recalled that during this period Schuschnigg made
concessions. He appointed Seyss-Inquart as Councillor of State
in July, 1937. He had previously appointed a “Committee of
Seven” to discuss with him the desires of the national opposition.
He played a delaying game, presumably in the hope that a
change in the foreign situation would provide him with external
support.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Germany’s Diplomatic Preparations for Conquest.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The program of the Nazi conspiracy aimed at weakening Austria
externally and internally, by removing its support from
without as well as by penetrating within. This program was of
the utmost significance, since the events of 25 July 1934 inside
Austria were overshadowed by the fact that Mussolini had
brought his troops to the Brenner Pass and poised them there
as a strong protector of his northern neighbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, interference in the affairs of Austria, and steady
increase in the pressure needed to acquire control over that
country, required removal of the possibility that Italy or any
other country would come to Austria’s aid. But the program of
the conspiracy for the weakening and isolation of Austria was
integrated with its foreign policy program in Europe generally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators’ diplomatic preparation for war is described
in a second affidavit of George S. Messersmith (<span class='it'>2385-PS</span>),
which may be summarized as follows: In 1933 the Nazis openly
acknowledged the ambition to expand the territorial borders of
the Reich to include Austria and Czechoslovakia. As for the other
countries of Southeast Europe, the professed objective was stated
<span class='pageno' title='475' id='Page_475'></span>
at that time not in terms of territorial acquisition but rather in
terms of political and economic control. And the stated objectives
were not limited to Southeast Europe, for important Nazis
even in 1933 were stating their desire for the Ukraine as the
granary of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they came to power, the Nazis had two principal objectives.
They wanted to establish their power in Germany. And
they wanted to rearm and establish Germany’s armed power.
They wanted peace until they were ready. But they wanted to
acquire the ability to carry out their program in Europe by force
if necessary, although preferably by a threat of force. They
accordingly embarked upon their vast rearmament program. It
proceeded very rapidly. Goering and General Milch often said to
Messersmith or in his presence that the Nazis were concentrating
on air power in their rearmament, as the weapon of terror most
likely to give Germany a dominant position and the weapon which
could be developed most rapidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to material preparation for war, there was preparation
for war in the psychological sense. Throughout Germany
youth of all ages could be observed in military exercises and field
maneuvers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, as Mr. Messersmith also observes,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Military preparation and psychological preparation were
coupled with <span class='it'>diplomatic</span> preparation designed to so disunite
and isolate their intended victims as to render them defenseless
against German aggression.” (<span class='it'>2385-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In 1933 the difficulties facing Germany in the political and
diplomatic field loomed large. France was the dominant military
power on the continent. She had woven a system of mutual
assistance in the West and in the East. The Locarno Pact of
1928, supplemented by the Franco-Belgian alliance, guaranteed
the territorial status quo in the West. Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia,
and Rumania were allied in the Little Entente and each in turn
was united with France by mutual assistance pacts. Since 1922,
France and Poland had likewise been allied against external
aggression. Italy had made plain her special interest in Austrian
independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nazi Germany launched a vigorous diplomatic campaign to
break up the existing alliances and understandings, to create
divisions among the members of the Little Entente and the other
Eastern European powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Specifically, Nazi Germany countered these alliances with
promises of economic gain for cooperating with Germans. To
some of these countries she offered extravagant promises of territorial
<span class='pageno' title='476' id='Page_476'></span>
and economic rewards. She offered Carinthia, in Austria,
to Yugoslavia. She offered part of Czechoslovakia to Hungary and
part of Poland. She offered Yugoslav territory to Hungary at
the same time that she was offering land in Hungary to Yugoslavia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mr. Messersmith states in his affidavit:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Austria and Czechoslovakia were the first on the German
program of aggression. As early as 1934, Germany began to
woo neighbors of these countries with promises of a share
in the loot. To Yugoslavia in particular they offered Carinthia.
Concerning the Yugoslav reaction, I reported at the
time:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>‘* * * The major factor in the internal situation in
the last week has been the increase in tension with respect
to the Austrian Nazi refugees in Yugoslavia. * * *
There is very little doubt but that Goering, when he made
his trip to various capitals in Southeastern Europe about
six months ago, told the Yugoslavs that they would get a
part of Carinthia, when a National Socialist Government
came into power in Austria. * * * The Nazi seed
sown in Yugoslavia has been sufficient to cause trouble
and there are undoubtedly a good many people there who
look with a great deal of benevolence on those Nazi refugees
who went to Yugoslavia in the days following July
25.’</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany made like promises of territorial gains to Hungary
and to Poland in order to gain their cooperation or at
least their acquiescence in the proposed dismemberment of
Czechoslovakia. As I learned from my diplomatic colleagues
in Vienna, von Papen and von Mackensen in Vienna and in
Budapest in 1935, were spreading the idea of division of
Czechoslovakia, in which division Germany was to get Bohemia,
Hungary to get Slovakia, and Poland the rest. This
did not deceive any of these countries for they knew that the
intention of Nazi Germany was to take all.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Nazi German Government did not hesitate to make
inconsistent promises when it suited its immediate objectives.
I recall the Yugoslav Minister in Vienna saying to me
in 1934 or 1935, that Germany had made promises to Hungary
of Yugoslav territory while at the same time promising
to Yugoslavs portions of Hungarian territory. The Hungarian
Minister in Vienna later gave me the same information.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I should emphasize here in this statement that the men who
<span class='pageno' title='477' id='Page_477'></span>
made these promises were not only the died-in-the-wool Nazis
but more conservative Germans who already had begun to
willingly lend themselves to the Nazi program. In an official
despatch to the Department of State from Vienna dated
October 10, 1935, I wrote as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>‘* * * Europe will not get away from the myth that
Neurath, Papen and Mackensen are not dangerous people
and that they are “diplomats of the old school.” They are
in fact servile instruments of the regime and just because
the outside world looks upon them as harmless, they are
able to work more effectively. They are able to sow discord
just because they propagate the myth that they are
not in sympathy with the regime.’ ” (<span class='it'>2385-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, Nazi Germany was able to promote these divisions
and increase its own aggressive strength by using as its
agents in making these promises men who on outward appearances
were merely conservative diplomats. It is true that Nazis
openly scoffed at any notion of international obligations. It is
true that the real trump in Germany’s hand was its rearmament
and more than that its willingness to go to war. And yet the
attitude of the various countries was not influenced by those
considerations alone. Schuschnigg laid great stress upon, and
was willing to go to some lengths to obtain, an assurance of
independence. All these countries found it possible to believe
apparently substantial personages, like von Neurath, for example.
They were led to rely on the assurances given, which
seemed more impressive since the diplomats making them were
represented as men who were not Nazis and would not stoop to
go along with the base designs of the Nazis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Germany’s approach toward Great Britain and France was
in terms of limited expansion as the price of peace. They signed
a naval limitations treaty with England and discussed a Locarno
Air Pact. In the case of both France and England, they limited
their statement of intentions and harped on fears of Communism
and war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In making these various promises, Germany was untroubled by
notions of the sanctity of international obligations. High-ranking
Nazis, including Goering, Frick, and Frank, openly stated to Mr.
Messersmith that Germany would observe her international
undertakings only so long as it suited Germany’s interests to do
so. As Mr. Messersmith states in his affidavit:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“High-ranking Nazis with whom I had to maintain official
contact, particularly men such as Goering, Goebbels, Ley,
Frick, Frank, Darré and others, repeatedly scoffed at my
<span class='pageno' title='478' id='Page_478'></span>
position as to the binding character of treaties and openly
stated to me that Germany would observe her international
undertakings only so long as it suited Germany’s interests to
do so. Although these statements were openly made to me as
they were, I am sure, made to others, these Nazi leaders were
not really disclosing any secret for on many occasions they
expressed the same ideas publicly.” (<span class='it'>2385-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>France and Italy worked actively in Southeastern Europe to
counter Germany’s moves. France made attempts to promote an
East Locarno Pact and to foster an economic accord between
Austria and the other Danubian powers. Italy’s effort was to
organize an economic bloc of Austria, Hungary, and Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Germany foiled these efforts by redoubling its promises of
loot, by continuing its armament, and by another significant
stratagem. The Nazis stirred up internal dissensions to disunite
and weaken their intended victims. They supported the Austrian
Nazis and the Henlein Party in Czechoslovakia. They probed
what Goebbels called the “sore spots.” In Yugoslavia they played
on the differences between the Croats and the Serbs, and in
particular played on the fear of the restoration of the Hapsburgs
in Austria, a fear which was very real in Yugoslavia. In Hungary,
Poland, and Rumania they stirred up other fears and hatreds.
These measures had considerable effect in preventing these countries
from joining any which were opposed to German designs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis consolidated their power in Germany very quickly.
The German people became increasingly imbued with the Nazi
military spirit. Within Germany, resistance to the Nazis disappeared.
Army officers, including many who originally aided the
Nazis with the limited objective of restoring the German Army,
increasingly became imbued with aggressive designs as they saw
how remarkably their power was growing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The power of Nazi Germany outside the borders of the Reich
increased correspondingly. Other countries feared its military
might. Important political leaders in Yugoslavia, in Hungary,
and in Poland became convinced that the Nazi regime would gain
its ends and that the best course was to play along with Germany.
These countries became apathetic toward the development of
Anschluss with Austria and cooperative toward the dismemberment
of Czechoslovakia. Mr. Messersmith’s despatches from
Europe to the State Department, setting out the developments in
these countries, are included in his second affidavit. (<span class='it'>2385-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Italy, Germany’s initial objective was to sow discord
between Yugoslavia and Italy, by promising Yugoslavia Italian
territory, particularly Trieste. This was to prevent France from
<span class='pageno' title='479' id='Page_479'></span>
reaching agreement with them and to block an East Locarno Pact.
As Mr. Messersmith states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“While Italy openly opposed efforts at Anschluss with Austria
in 1934, Italian ambitions in Abyssinia provided Germany
with the opportunity to sow discord between Italy and
France and England, and to win Italy over to acceptance of
Germany’s program in exchange for German support of
Italy’s plans in Abyssinia.” (<span class='it'>2385-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That paved the way for the Austro-German declaration of 11
July 1936. And in the Fall of 1936, Germany extended the hand
of friendship and common purpose to Italy in an alliance—the
Rome-Berlin Axis. This, together with Germany’s alliance with
Japan, put increasing pressure on England and increased the
relative strength of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, by means of careful preparation in the diplomatic field,
among others, the Nazi conspirators had woven a position for
themselves so that they could seriously consider plans for war
and outline a timetable. That timetable was developed in the
conference with Hitler in the Reichschancellery on 5 November
1937. (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Crystallization of the Plan to Wage Aggressive War in
Europe and to Seize Austria and Czechoslovakia.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At the meeting of the conspirators in the Reichschancellery on
5 November 1937, the Fuehrer insisted that Germany should have
more space in Europe (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). It was concluded that the space
required must be taken by force, three different cases were outlined
as possibilities, and it was decided that the problem would
have to be solved before the period 1943 to 1945. The nature of
a war in the near future was envisaged, specifically against Austria
and Czechoslovakia. Hitler said that for the improvement of
Germany’s military political position the first aim of the Nazis
in every case of entanglement by war must be to conquer Czechoslovakia
and Austria simultaneously, in order to remove any
threat from the flanks in case of a possible advance Westwards.
Hitler then calculated that the conquest of Czechoslovakia and
Austria would constitute the conquest of food for from five to six
million people, assuming that the comprehensive emigration of
one million from Austria could be carried out. He further
pointed out that the annexation of the two states to Germany
would constitute a considerable relief, both militarily and politically,
since they would provide shorter and better frontiers, would
free fighting personnel for other purposes, and would make possible
the reconstitution of new armies. (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='480' id='Page_480'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The minutes of this meeting reveal a crystallization in the
policy of the Nazi conspirators. It had always been their aim
to acquire Austria. At the outset a revolutionary Putsch was
attempted, using the personnel of the Austrian Nazis, but that
failed. The next period was one of surface recognition of the
independence of Austria and the use of devious means to
strengthen the position of the Nazis internally in Austria. Now,
however, it became clear that the need for Austria, in the light
of the larger aggressive purposes of the Nazi conspirators, was
sufficiently great to warrant the use of force in order to obtain
Austria with the desired speed. The Nazis were, in fact, able
to secure Austria, after having weakened it internally and
removed from it the support of other nations, merely by setting the
German military machine in motion and making a threat of force.
The German armies were able to cross the border and secure the
country without the necessity of firing a shot. Careful planning
for war and the readiness to use war as an instrument of political
action made it possible in the end for the Nazis to master Austria
without having to fight for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German High Command had previously considered preparations
against Austria. On 24 June 1937 the Reich Minister
for War and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, General
von Blomberg, issued a Top Secret Directive (<span class='it'>C-175</span>). The
importance of this directive, establishing a unified preparation
of the Armed Forces for war, is indicated by the fact that the
carbon copy received by the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy
was one of only four copies. This directive from General von
Blomberg stated that the general political situation indicated that
Germany need not consider an attack from any side, and also that
Germany did not intend to unleash a European war. It then
stated, in point 1:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Nevertheless the politically fluid world situation, which does
not preclude surprising incidents, demands a continuous preparedness
for war of the German Armed Forces.</p>

opportunities should they occur.” (<span class='it'>C-175</span>)</p>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The directive then indicated that there would be certain preparations
of a general nature for war.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“2.</span><p class='listPara'>The preparations of a general nature include:</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The directive finally indicated, in Part 3, that there might
be special preparation for war in Austria:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Armed intervention in Austria in the event of her restoring
the Monarchy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The object of this operation will be to compel Austria by
armed force to give up a restoration.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Making use of the domestic political divisions of the Austrian
people, the march in will be made in the general direction
of Vienna and will break any resistance.” (<span class='it'>C-175</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This plan is indicated in the document as having been superseded
by new and more detailed plans following the meeting of
November 5, 1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plans of the conspirators were further revealed in two
conversations held by William Bullitt, United States Ambassador
to France with Schacht and with Goering in November, 1937.
Both Schacht and Goering told Bullitt that Germany was determined
to annex Austria. Goering further added that there could
be no final solution of the Sudeten-German question other than
inclusion in the Reich. (<span class='it'>L-151</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>Pressure and Threats Resulting in Further Concessions:
Berchtesgaden, 12 February 1938.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Chancellor Schuschnigg states in an affidavit (<span class='it'>2995-PS</span>) that
in 1938 von Papen suggested to him that he should meet Hitler
at Berchtesgaden. After several discussions Schuschnigg agreed
to go, provided three conditions were met:</p>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)</span><p class='listPara'>He must be invited by Hitler.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)</span><p class='listPara'>He must be previously informed of the precise agenda and
assured that the agreement of 11 July 1936 would be
maintained.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)</span><p class='listPara'>There was to be an agreement in advance that the communique
to be published at the end of the meeting would
affirm the 11 July 1936 agreement.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'>Von Papen brought back word from Hitler inviting Schuschnigg
and agreeing with these conditions, particularly the maintenance
of the July 1936 treaty. (<span class='it'>2995-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The official German communique of this conference between
Hitler and Schuschnigg at Obersalzberg on 12 February 1938
was calm (<span class='it'>2461-PS</span>). The communique stated that the unofficial
meeting was caused by the mutual desire to clarify by personal
conversations the questions relating to the relationship between
<span class='pageno' title='482' id='Page_482'></span>
the German Reich and Austria. The communique listed, as
among those present, Schuschnigg and his Foreign Minister
Schmidt, Hitler and his Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and von
Papen. The communique concluded: “Both statesmen are convinced
that the measures taken by them constitute at the same
time an effective contribution toward the peaceful development
of the European situation.” (<span class='it'>2461-PS</span>). A similar communique
was issued by the Austrian Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, as a result of the conference great concessions were
obtained by the German Government from Austria. The principal
concessions are contained in the official Austrian communique
dated 16 February 1938 (<span class='it'>2464-PS</span>). The communique
announced a reorganization of the Austrian Cabinet, including
the appointment of Seyss-Inquart to the position of Minister of
Security and Interior. In addition, announcement was made of
a general political amnesty to Nazis convicted of crimes.
(<span class='it'>2464-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later, on 18 February 1938, another concession was
divulged in the official German and Austrian communique concerning
the equal rights of Austrian National Socialists in Austria
(<span class='it'>2469-PS</span>). The communique announced that pursuant to
the Berchtesgaden conference, the Austrian National Socialists
would be taken into the Fatherland Front, the single legal political
party of Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schuschnigg’s affidavit on his Berchtesgaden visit on February
12, 1938 (<span class='it'>2995-PS</span>) points out that considerable pressure
was brought to bear on him at the Berghof. Several Generals—Keitel,
Sperrle, and Reichenau, names which were omitted from
the formal communique later issued—were present on his arrival.
The conference started with a two-hour conference between
Schuschnigg and Hitler alone. Hitler made no precise demands
but attacked Schuschnigg violently. In the words of the affidavit:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I furthermore state and affirm that, immediately after arriving
at the Berghof, I commenced a conference with Hitler.
Hitler and I were alone for two hours. Hitler attacked in a
violent manner the politics of Austria, both of the past and
present. He furthermore informed me that he, Hitler, had
‘decided to bring the Austrian question to a solution so-or-so,
even if he had to immediately use military force.’ At no time
during the first two hours of our conversation did Hitler ever
make any precise demands or requests of me, but spent the
whole of the two hours accusing me and menacing me as a
traitor to Austrian politics. Especially he informed me that,
according to his knowledge, Austria could no longer reckon
<span class='pageno' title='483' id='Page_483'></span>
with any assistance from other European Powers, and that
Austria now stood alone in the world. He furthermore added—‘Schuschnigg,
you now have the chance to put your name
alongside the names of other famous German leaders, such as
Goering, Hess, Frick, Epp, Goebbels, and others.’ * * * “.
(<span class='it'>2995-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After Hitler’s violent threats, Schuschnigg had discussions of
a calmer nature with von Ribbentrop and von Papen. They talked
soothingly and comfortingly to Schuschnigg but reached the
same conclusion, that he should yield to German demands, which
in practical effect meant Nazi control of the Government of
Austria.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I furthermore state and affirm that I was next called before
Joachim von Ribbentrop with my Secretary for Foreign
Affairs, Guido Schmidt, and, in the presence of Franz von
Papen, Ribbentrop exhibited to me a typewritten draft containing
the conditions and demands made by Hitler upon me
and Austria. He furthermore added that Hitler has informed
me, Ribbentrop, ‘that these demands that I now offer
to you are the final demands of the Fuehrer and that he,
Hitler, is not prepared to further discuss them’. He further
stated that, ‘you must accept the whole of these demands
herein contained’. Ribbentrop then advised me to accept the
demands at once. I protested, and referred him to my previous
agreements with von Papen, made prior to coming to
Berchtesgaden, and made it clear to Ribbentrop that I was
not prepared to be confronted with such unreasonable demands
as he had then and there placed before me. Von
Papen, still present, apologized and informed me that he,
von Papen, was entirely surprised and not at all informed
about the aims of the Fuehrer, as here laid down. He further
stated, and informed me, that he, von Papen, could only
offer his advice and that he should now accede to, and sign,
these demands. He furthermore informed me that I could be
assured that Hitler would take care that, if I signed these
demands and acceded to them, that from that time on Germany
would remain loyal to this Agreement and that there
would be no further difficulties for Austria.” (<span class='it'>2995-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, after obtaining some minor concessions from Ribbentrop,
Schuschnigg met with Hitler again. This time Hitler not
only put pressure upon Schuschnigg, but also, upon learning that
the approval of President Miklas of Austria was necessary,
indicated clearly to Schuschnigg that military action would follow
if Miklas did not approve the agreement. In the words of
Schuschnigg’s affidavit:
<span class='pageno' title='484' id='Page_484'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I further state and say, that I then went before Hitler
again. Hitler was very excited and informed me that he
would make a final test with Austria, and stated further:
‘that you must fulfill the conditions of the demands made by
me on you within three days, or else I will order the march
into Austria.’ I replied: ‘I am not able to take over the obligation
to fulfill your demands, for I am only the Chancellor
of Austria, and that obligation you attempt to place upon me
is the duty only of the Federal President, Miklas; I am only
able to sign the draft and, when I arrive in Vienna, to present
it to the Federal President’. Hitler then flung open the
door and yelled ‘Keitel’. At the same time, Hitler asked me
to wait outside. Keitel then came in to Hitler. After twenty
minutes or more I was again called before Hitler and, when
before him, he, Hitler, informed me as follows: ‘For the first
time in my life, I have changed my mind. You must sign the
demands that I have made upon you, then report them to the
Federal President, Miklas, and within three days from now
Austria must fulfill the Agreement, otherwise things will
take their natural course’. I then agreed to sign the demands
and, while waiting in Hitler’s private room, he, Hitler, in an
entirely changed mood, said to Franz von Papen, who was
also present, ‘Herr von Papen, through your assistance I
was appointed Chancellor of Germany and thus the Reich
was saved from the abyss of communism. I will never forget
that’. Papen replied: ‘<span class='it'>Jawohl, Mein Fuehrer</span>’.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I furthermore say and affirm that I, in the presence of Ribbentrop,
Guido Schmidt, von Papen, and Hitler, signed the
demands, and retained a copy for the Austrian Government.
“I further state and affirm that, on the way back to Vienna
from Berchtesgaden, Franz von Papen accompanied me
and my party. Between the Berghof and Berchtesgaden,
von Papen informed me as follows: ‘Now, you have your
own impression of how excited the Fuehrer can get, but that
happens very seldom, and I am convinced that the next time
you meet him, you will have an amicable conversation with
him.’ ” (<span class='it'>2995-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The pressure put on Schuschnigg at Berchtesgaden is also disclosed
in von Papen’s notes on his last meeting with Schuschnigg,
on 26 February 1938, the last two paragraphs of which read:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I then introduced into the conversation the widespread
opinion that he had acted under ‘brutal pressure’ in Berchtesgaden.
I myself had been present and been able to state
that he had always and at every point had complete freedom
<span class='pageno' title='485' id='Page_485'></span>
of decision. The Chancellor replied he had actually been
under considerable moral pressure, he could not deny that.
He had made notes on the talk which bore that out. I reminded
him that despite this talk he had not seen his way
clear to make any concessions, and I asked him whether
without the pressure he would have been ready to make the
concessions he made late in the evening. He answered: ‘To
be honest, no!’ It appears to me of importance to record
this statement.” (<span class='it'>1544-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>For diplomatic purposes von Papen, who had been at Berchtesgaden,
kept up the pretense that there had been no pressure.
But General Jodl, writing the account of current events for his
diary, was more candid. This hand-written diary discloses not
only the pressure at Berchtesgaden but also the fact that for some
days thereafter, General Keitel and Admiral Canaris worked out
a scheme for shamming military pressure, in order to coerce
President Miklas into ratifying the agreement. And so the Nazi
conspirators kept up the military pressure, with threats of invasion,
for some days after the Berchtesgaden conference, in order
to produce the desired effect on Miklas. (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following entries, for Feb. 11-Feb. 14 were made in Jodl’s
diary:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>11 February</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the evening and on 12 February General K. with General
V. Reichenau and Sperrle at the Obersalzberg. Schuschnigg
together with G. Schmidt are again being put under heaviest
political and military pressure. At 2300 hours Schuschnigg
signs protocol.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>13 February</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the afternoon General K. asks Admiral C. and myself to
come to his apartment. He tells us that the Fuehrer’s order
is to the effect that military pressure by shamming military
action should be kept up until the 15th. Proposals for these
deceptive maneuvers are drafted and submitted to the
Fuehrer by telephone for approval.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>14 February</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At 2:40 o’clock the agreement of the Fuehrer arrives.
Canaris went to Munich to the Counter-Intelligence office
VII and initiates the different measures.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The effect is quick and strong. In Austria the impression is
created that Germany is undertaking serious military preparations.”
(<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>The proposals for deceptive maneuvers mentioned by Jodl
were signed by Keitel. Underneath his signature appeared
<span class='pageno' title='486' id='Page_486'></span>
a pencilled note that the Fuehrer approved the proposals.
Among the rumors which Keitel proposed for the intimidation
of Austria were the following:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. To take no real preparatory measures in the Army or
Luftwaffe. No troop movements or redeployments.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Spread false, but quite credible news, which may
lead to the conclusion of military preparations against Austria.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The pattern of intimidation and rumor was effective, for in due
course, as is shown in the communiques already referred to, President
Miklas ratified the Berchtesgaden agreement, which foreshadowed
a National Socialist Austria.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>E. <span class='it'>Events Culminating in the German Invasion on 12 March
1938.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Plebiscite.</span> The day after his appointment as Minister
of the Interior, Seyss-Inquart flew to Berlin for a conference
with Hitler. (<span class='it'>2484-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 9 March 1938, three weeks after Seyss-Inquart had been
put in charge of the police, Schuschnigg announced that he would
hold a plebiscite throughout Austria on the following Sunday, 13
March 1938. The question was: “Are you for an independent
and social, a Christian, German and united Austria?” A “yes”
answer to this question was clearly compatible with the agreement
made by the German Government on 11 July 1936, and
carried forward at Berchtesgaden on 12 February 1938. Moreover,
<span class='pageno' title='487' id='Page_487'></span>
for a long while the Nazis had been demanding a plebiscite
on the question of Anschluss. But the Nazis apparently appreciated
the likelihood of a strong “yes” vote on the question put
by Schuschnigg, and they could not tolerate the possibility of
such a vote of confidence in the Schuschnigg Government. They
took this occasion to overturn the Austrian Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the Plebiscite was not announced until the evening
of 9 March, the Nazi Organization received word about it earlier
in the day. It was determined by the Nazis that they had to ask
Hitler what to do about the situation, and that they would prepare
a letter of protest against the Plebiscite from Seyss-Inquart to
Schuschnigg, and that pending Hitler’s approval, Seyss-Inquart
would pretend to negotiate with Schuschnigg about details of the
plebiscite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the words of Gauleiter Rainer’s report to Reichscommissioner
Buerckel:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The <span class='it'>Landesleitung</span> received word about the planned plebiscite
through illegal information services, on 9 March 1938 at
10 a. m. At the session which was called immediately afterwards,
Seyss-Inquart explained that he had known about
this for only a few hours, but that he could not talk about it
because he had given his word to keep silent on this subject.
But during the talks he made us understand that the illegal
information we received was based on truth, and that in
view of the new situation, he had been cooperating with the
<span class='it'>Landesleitung</span> from the very first moment. Klausner, Jury,
Rainer, Globocnik and Seyss-Inquart were present at the
first talks which were held at 10 a. m. There it was decided
that first, the Fuehrer had to be informed immediately; secondly,
the opportunity for the Fuehrer to intervene must
be given to him by way of an official declaration made by
Minister Seyss-Inquart to Schuschnigg; and thirdly, Seyss-Inquart
must negotiate with the government until clear
instructions and orders were received from the Fuehrer.
Seyss-Inquart and Rainer together composed a letter to
Schuschnigg, and only one copy of it was brought to the
Fuehrer by Globocnik, who flew to him on the afternoon of
9 March 1938.” (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Germany’s Preparation for the Use of Force.</span> When news
of the Plebiscite reached Berlin, it started a tremendous amount
of activity. Hitler was determined not to tolerate the plebiscite.
Accordingly, he called his military advisers and ordered preparation
for the march into Austria. He made diplomatic preparations
<span class='pageno' title='488' id='Page_488'></span>
by explaining in a letter to Mussolini the reasons why he
was going to march into Austria. In the absence of von Ribbentrop,
who was temporarily detained in London, von Neurath took
over the affairs of the Foreign Office again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The terse and somewhat disconnected notes in General Jodl’s
diary give a vivid account of the activity in Berlin. The entry
for the 10th of March 1938 reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“By surprise and without consulting his ministers, Schuschnigg
ordered a plebiscite for Sunday, 13, March, which
should bring strong majority for the Legitimists in the absence
of plan or preparation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Fuehrer is determined not to tolerate it. The same night,
March 9 to 10, he calls for Goering. General v. Reichenau
is called back from Cairo Olympic Committee. General v.
Schebert is ordered to come, as well as Minister Glaise Horstenau,
who is with the District leader (<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>) Buerckel
in the Palatinate. General Keitel communicates the facts at
1:45. He drives to the Reichskanzlei at 10 o’clock. I follow
at 10:15, according to the wish of General v. Viebahn, to
give him the old draft.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Prepare case Otto.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1300 hours: General K informs Chief of Operational Staff
(and) Admiral Canaris. Ribbentrop is being detained in
London. Neurath takes over the Foreign Office.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Fuehrer wants to transmit ultimatum to the Austrian Cabinet.
A personal letter is dispatched to Mussolini and the
reasons are developed which force the Fuehrer to take
action.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1830 hours: Mobilization order is given to the Command of
the 8th Army (Corps Area 3) 7th and 13th Army Corps;
without reserve Army.” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a directive of the Supreme High Command of the Armed
Forces, dated 11 March 1938 and initialed by Jodl and Keitel,
Hitler stated his mixed political and military intentions:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. If these measures prove unsuccessful, I intend to invade
Austria with armed forces to establish constitutional conditions
and to prevent further outrages against the pro-German
population.</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. The forces of the Army and Air Force detailed for this
operation must be ready for invasion and/or ready for action
on the 12th of March 1938 at the latest from 1200 hours.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I reserve the right to give permission for crossing and flying
over the frontier, and to decide the actual moment for
invasion.
<span class='pageno' title='489' id='Page_489'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. The behavior of the troops must give the impression
that we do not want to wage war against our Austrian brothers.
It is in our interest that the whole operation shall be
carried out without any violence but in the form of a peaceful
entry welcomed by the population. Therefore any provocation
is to be avoided. If, however, resistance is offered
it must be broken ruthlessly by force of arms.” (<span class='it'>C-102</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An implementing directive of 11 March 1938 issued by Jodl
provided further:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If Czechoslovakian troops or militia units are encountered
in Austria, they are to be regarded as hostile.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Italians are everywhere to be treated as friends especially
as Mussolini has declared himself uninterested in the
solution of the Austrian Question”. (<span class='it'>C-103</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The military preparations for invasion were complete.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Events of 11 March in Austria.</span> The events of 11
March 1938 in Austria are available in three separate accounts.
Although these accounts differ in some minor details, they afford
each other almost complete corroboration with regard to the
way in which the German Government deprived Austria of its
sovereignty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first account is contained in a third affidavit executed by
Schuschnigg (<span class='it'>2996-PS</span>). Schuschnigg first states that he had
been discussing the plebiscite with Seyss-Inquart, and that
Seyss-Inquart had made some procedural objections but in general
indicated his general willingness to support the plebiscite.
Schuschnigg went to bed on March 10 thinking the plebiscite
would be a success. But on the morning of March 11 he was told
that traffic from Germany had stopped, and that German Army
forces were moving to the border. After 10 a. m. Seyss-Inquart
came to Schuschnigg’s office with Glaise-Horstenau. Glaise-Horstenau
had just come from Berlin and reported that Hitler
was in a rage. (<span class='it'>2996-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schuschnigg’s affidavit then relates the three ultimatums presented
by the German Government:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Seyss-Inquart was then and there called to the telephone
and, upon his return, read to me from a scrap of paper which
he held in his hand, the contents of a telephone call which he
alleged was just then received by him from Goering in
Berlin. The contents as he read it to me was as follows: ‘The
Chancellor must revoke the proposed plebiscite within the
time of one hour, and after three or four weeks, Austria
must oblige herself to carry out a plebiscite concerning the
<span class='pageno' title='490' id='Page_490'></span>
Anschluss according to the SAAR status, otherwise the German
Army is ordered to pass the Austrian frontier’.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I further state and say that after informing the Federal
President of this demand made on Austria by Germany, we
decided to recall the Plebiscite, and thereupon I informed
Seyss-Inquart and Glaise-Horstenau of our intentions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Seyss-Inquart said that he would go to the telephone and
inform Goering in Berlin concerning the decision of the Austrian
Government, at that time made. In a few minutes, he,
Seyss-Inquart, returned to my office, and informed me further,
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>‘I have had a telephone conversation with Goering, and
Goering has ordered me to inform the Federal Chancellor
Schuschnigg, as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>‘ “The situation can only be saved for Austria when Schuschnigg
resigns as the Chancellor of Austria within two hours
and Seyss-Inquart is appointed as the new Chief of the Austrian
Government; if Seyss-Inquart does not inform me,
Goering, within two hours, I, Goering, will suppose that you
are hindered from doing so” ’.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“I then reported to the Federal President the new developments,
and, after some conversation with him and other
members of the Government, I decided to resign. The Federal
President reluctantly accepted my resignation at 3:30
p. m. on the afternoon of the 11th of March 1938. He expressed
himself unwilling to appoint Seyss-Inquart as the
Federal Chancellor—he therefore asked me to continue my
duties as caretaker Chancellor until he had decided who
would succeed me as Federal Chancellor. I accepted and remained
as ‘caretaker Chancellor’ from 3:30 p. m., 11 March
1938 until about 11:30 p. m. the same night, when Seyss-Inquart
was appointed to the position of Federal Chancellor.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I further state and say that at about 3:30 p. m. on the afternoon
of 11 March 1938, the Foreign Office of the Austrian
Government contacted the Embassy of Germany in Vienna,
to ascertain if the demands that had been then and there
made by Goering on Austria were the official demands of the
German Government. The Military Attache of Germany in
Vienna, one Lieutenant General Muff, came before the Austrian
Federal President, and repeated the contents of the
German ultimatums that had previously been delivered to us
by Seyss-Inquart.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I furthermore state and say, that the Federal President,
at about 7:30 or 8:00 o’clock p. m. on the night of 11 March
<span class='pageno' title='491' id='Page_491'></span>
1938 ordered me, as caretaker Chancellor, to broadcast the
events of the day and to protest against the demands made
on Austria during that day by Germany. Furthermore, to
inform the world that Austria had been forced to give in to
those demands of Germany through superior force * * *.”
(<span class='it'>2996-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The report from Gauleiter Rainer to Reichscommissioner
Buerckel also discusses the events of March 11. In general,
Rainer’s report corroborates Schuschnigg’s affidavit. (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another document recalls vividly the events of 11 March 1938.
This document, which was found in a building of the courtyard of
the German Air Ministry, is a binder containing typed transcripts
of some 27 telephone conversations, held in Goering’s office in
the Air Ministry on 11 March 1938 and up to 14 March 1938.
Most of the conversations were conducted by Goering, although
at least one was held by Hitler (<span class='it'>2949-PS</span>). (For purposes of
convenience these telephone calls are marked with an identifying
letter, running from A through Z and then beginning again
with AA).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first group of conversations took place between Field
Marshal Goering, who was identified as F., and Seyss-Inquart,
who was identified as S. The transcript is in part, in the language
of these two persons and is in part a summary of the actual conversations.
At 2:45 p. m. the following conversation occurred:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“F:</span><p class='listPara'>How do you do, doctor. My brother-in-law, is he with
you?</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“S:</span><p class='listPara'>No.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'>“Thereupon the conversation took approximately the following
turn:</p>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“F:</span><p class='listPara'>How are things with you? Have you resigned, or do
you have any news?</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“S.</span><p class='listPara'>The Chancellor has cancelled the elections for Sunday,
and therefore he has put S. and the other gentlemen
in a difficult situation. Besides having called off the
elections, extensive precautionary measures are being
ordered, among others curfew at 8 p. m.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“F:</span><p class='listPara'>Replied that in his opinion the measures taken by
Chancellor Schuschnigg were not satisfactory in any
respect. At this moment he could not commit himself
officially. F. will take a clear stand very shortly. In
calling off the elections, he could see a postponement
only, not a change of the present situation which had
been brought about by the behavior of the Chancellor
Schuschnigg in breaking the Berchtesgaden agreement.
<span class='pageno' title='492' id='Page_492'></span></p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'>“Thereupon a conversation took place between F. and the
Fuehrer. Afterwards F. phoned again S. This conversation
was held at 15:05.</p>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“F:</span><p class='listPara'>Told S. that Berlin did not agree whatsoever with the
decision made by Chancellor Schuschnigg since he did
not enjoy any more the confidence of our government
because he had broken the Berchtesgaden agreement,
and therefore further confidence in his future actions
did not exist. Consequently, the National Minister, S.
and the others, are being requested to immediately
hand in their resignation to the Chancellor, and also
to ask the Chancellor to resign. F. added that if after
a period of one hour no report had come through the
assumption would be made that S. would no more be
in the position to phone. That would mean that the
gentlemen had handed in their resignations. S. was
then told to send the telegram to the Fuehrer as
agreed upon. As a matter of course, an immediate
commission by the Federal President for S. to form a
new cabinet would follow Schuschnigg’s resignation.”
(<span class='it'>2949-PS, Part A</span>)</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Goering told Seyss-Inquart that it was not enough for
Schuschnigg to cancel the election. And twenty minutes later
he telephoned Seyss-Inquart to state that Schuschnigg must
resign. When informed at about an hour later that Schuschnigg
had resigned, he pointed out that in addition it was necessary
to have Seyss-Inquart at the head of the Cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later Goering phoned Dombrowski at the German
Embassy in Vienna. He was concerned that the Nazi Party and
all its formations should be legalized promptly:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'>“Goering: Now to go on. The Party has definitely been
legalized?</p>

<p class='hang'>“Dombrowski: But that is * * * it isn’t necessary to
even discuss that.</p>

<p class='hang'>“Goering: With all of its organizations.</p>

<p class='hang'>“Dombrowski: With all of its organizations within this

<p class='hang'>“Dombrowski: In uniform.</p>

<p class='hang'>“Goering: Good.</p>

<p class='hang'>“Dombrowski: calls attention to the fact that the SA and
SS have already been on duty for one-half hour which
means everything is all right.” (<span class='it'>2949-PS, Part C</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In addition Goering stated that the Cabinet must be formed by
<span class='pageno' title='493' id='Page_493'></span>
7:30 p. m., and he transmitted instructions, to be delivered to
Seyss-Inquart, as to who should be appointed to the cabinet:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'>“Goering: Yes, and by 7:30 he also must talk with the
Fuehrer and as to the Cabinet, Keppler will bring you
the names. One thing I have forgotten, Fishbeck
must have the Department of Economy and Commerce.</p>

<p class='hang'>“Dombrowski: That’s understood.</p>

<p class='hang'>“Goering: Kaltenbrunner is to have the Department of
Security and Bahr is to have the armed forces. The
Austrian Army is to be taken by Seyss-Inquart himself
and you know all about the Justice Department.</p>

<p class='hang'>“Dombrowski: Yes, yes.</p>

<p class='hang'>“Goering: Give me the name.</p>

<p class='hang'>“Dombrowski: Well, your brother-in-law. Isn’t that right?</p>

<p class='hang'>“Goering: Yes?</p>

<p class='hang'>“Dombrowski: Yes.</p>

<p class='hang'>“Goering: That’s right and then also Fishbeck.” (<span class='it'>2949-PS,
Part C</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>About twenty minutes later, at 5:26 p. m., Goering received
the news that Miklas was refusing to appoint Seyss-Inquart
as Chancellor. He issued instructions for an ultimatum to be
delivered to Miklas. The telephone conversation between Goering
and Seyss-Inquart went as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“G:</span><p class='listPara'>Now remember the following: You go immediately
together with Lt. General Muff and tell the Federal
President that if the conditions which are known to
you are not accepted immediately, the troops who are
already stationed at and advancing to the frontier
will march in tonight along the whole line, and Austria
will cease to exist. Lt. General Muff should go
with you and demand to be admitted for conference
immediately. Please, do inform us immediately about
Miklas’ position. Tell him, there is no time now for
any joke. Just through the false report we received
before action was delayed, but now the situation is
that tonight the invasion will begin from all the corners
of Austria. The invasion will be stopped and the
troops will be held at the border only if we are
informed by 7:30 that Miklas has entrusted you with
the Federal Chancellorship. (There follows a sentence
which is broken up) M. does not matter whatever
it might be, the immediate restoration of the
Party with all its organizations (again interruption)
<span class='pageno' title='494' id='Page_494'></span>
and then call out all the National Socialists all over
the country. They should now be in the streets. So
remember, report must be given till 7:30. Lt. General
Muff is supposed to come along with you. I shall
inform him immediately. If Miklas could not understand
it in 4 hours, we shall make him understand it
now in 4 minutes.” (<span class='it'>2949-PS, Part E</span>)</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later, at 6:28 p. m. Goering had an extensively interrupted
telephone conversation with Keppler and Muff and Seyss-Inquart.
When told that Miklas had refused to appoint Seyss-Inquart,
Goering replied:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“Goering:</span><p class='listPara'>Well, then Seyss-Inquart has to dismiss him;
just go upstairs again and just tell him plainly that SI
shall call on the National Socialists guard, and in 5
minutes the troops will march in by my order”.
(<span class='it'>2949-PS, Part H</span>)</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After an interruption, Seyss-Inquart came to the telephone
and informed Goering that Miklas was still sticking to his
old viewpoint, although a new person had gone in to talk to him
and there might be definite word in about ten minutes. The
conversation proceeded as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“G:</span><p class='listPara'>Listen, so I shall wait a few more minutes, till he comes
back, then you inform me via Blitz conversation in the
Reich Chancellery—as usually, but it has to be done
fast. I hardly can justify it as a matter of fact. I am
not entitled to do so; if it cannot be done, then you
have to take over the power; all right?</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“S.</span><p class='listPara'>But if he threatens?</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“G.</span><p class='listPara'>Call me via Blitz.” (<span class='it'>2949-PS, Part H</span>)</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It is plain that Goering and Seyss-Inquart had agreed on a plan
for Seyss-Inquart to take over power if Miklas remained obdurate.
The plan involved both the use of the National Socialist
forces in Austria and invasion by German troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later that night, at about 8:00 o’clock, Goering and Seyss-Inquart
had another conversation. This was after the ultimatum
had expired. Seyss-Inquart informed Goering that Miklas was
still refusing to name Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor. The conversation
then proceeded as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“G:</span><p class='listPara'>O.K. I shall give the order to march in and then you

<span class='pageno' title='495' id='Page_495'></span>
will immediately be subjected to our court-martial,
the court-martial of our invading troops. Is that

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another historical event—the famous telegram which Seyss-Inquart
sent to the German Government requesting it to send
troops into Austria to help put down disorder—was discussed
over the telephone. A conversation held at 8:48 between Goering
and Keppler proceeded as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“G:</span><p class='listPara'>Well, I do not know yet. Listen: The main thing is,

<p class='pindent'>It will be recalled that in the first conversation (Part A), held
at 3:05 p. m., Goering had requested Seyss-Inquart to send the
telegram agreed upon. But now the matter was so urgent that
Goering dictated the exact wording of the telegram over the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And an hour later, at 9:54 p. m., a conversation between Dr.
Dietrich in Berlin and Keppler in Vienna went as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>The Order to Invade Austria.</span> Communications with Austria
were now suspended. But the German military machine had
been set in motion. A Directive, dated 11 March 1938 at 2045
hours, from Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, initialled
by General Jodl and signed by Hitler, ordered the invasion of
Austria because of its failure to comply with the German ultimatum.
The directive reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Re: Operation Otto</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“<span class='it'>Directive No. 2</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Austrian Government has ceased to function of its

<p class='pindent'>“I expect the set objectives to be reached by exerting all

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Communications with Rome—Avoidance of Disaster.</span> But
at the very time that Hitler and Goering had embarked on this
military undertaking, they still had a question mark in their minds—Italy.
Italy had massed forces on the Italian-Austrian border
on the occasion of the 25 July 1934 putsch. Italy had traditionally
been the political protector of Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At 10:25 p. m. that evening, however, Hitler heard from Prince
Philip of Hessen, his Ambassador at Rome, that he had just returned
from the Palazzo Venezia, and Mussolini had accepted the
whole affair in a very-friendly manner. The telephone conversation
went thus:</p>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“Hesen:</span><p class='listPara'>I have just come back from Palazzo Venezia. The
Duce accepted the whole thing in a very-friendly
manner. He sends you his regards. He had been informed
from Austria, Schuschnigg gave him the news.
He had then said it would be a complete impossibility.
It would be a bluff, such a thing could not be done. So
he was told that it was unfortunately arranged thus
and it could not be changed any more. Then Mussolini
said that Austria would be immaterial to him.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“Fuehrer:</span><p class='listPara'>Then, please, tell Mussolini, I will never forget him for

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It will be recalled that Jodl referred in his diary (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>) to
the letter which Hitler sent to Mussolini. In this letter, dated 11
March 1938, after stating that Austria had been declining into
anarchy, Hitler wrote: “I have decided to reestablish order in my
Fatherland, order and tranquility, and to give to the popular will
the possibility of settling its own fate in unmistakable fashion
openly and by its own decision.” He stated that this was only
an act of self-defense, that he had no hostile intentions toward
Italy. (<span class='it'>2510-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the invasion, when in Linz, Austria, Hitler communicated
his gratitude to Mussolini once more, this time by telegraph:

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>The Appointment of Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor.</span> Late

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Later Communications with London—Misleading Explanations.</span>
On Sunday, 13 March 1938, the day after the invasion,
Goering, who had been left in charge of the Reich by Hitler, telephoned
Ribbentrop in London. Their conversation disclosed the
way in which the Nazis soothed and misled other nations:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'>“G: As you know the Fuehrer has entrusted me with the
administration of the current government procedures
(<span class='it'>Fuehrung der Regierungsgeschaft</span>). And therefore I
wanted to inform you. There is overwhelming joy in
Austria, that you can hear over the radio.</p>

<p class='hang'>“R: Yes, it is fantastic, isn’t it?</p>

<p class='hang'>“G: Yes, the last march into the Rhineland is completely
overshadowed. The Fuehrer was deeply moved, when
he talked to me last night. You must remember it
was the first time that he saw his homeland again.
Now, I mainly want to talk about political things.
Well, this story we had given an ultimatum, that is
just foolish gossip. From the very beginning the
National Socialist ministers and the representatives
of the people (<span class='it'>Volksreferenten</span>) have presented the
ultimatum. Later on, more and more prominent
people of the Movement Party participated, and as
a natural result, the Austrian National Socialist ministers
asked us to back them up, so they would not be
completely beaten up against and be subjected to terror
and civil war. Then we told them we would not
<span class='pageno' title='499' id='Page_499'></span>
allow Schuschnigg to provoke a civil war, under no
circumstances. Whether by Schuschnigg’s direct
order, or with consent the Communists and the Reds
had been armed, and were already making demonstrations,
which were photographed with “Heil Moskau”
and so on; naturally; all these facts caused some
danger for Wiener-Neustadt. Then you have to consider
that Schuschnigg made his speeches, telling them
the Fatherland Front (<span class='it'>Vaterlandische Front</span>) would
fight to its last man; one could not know that they
would capitulate like that and therefore Seyss-Inquart
who already had taken over the government asked us
to march in immediately. Before we had already
marched up to the frontier since we could not know
whether there would be a civil war or not. These are
the actual facts which can be proved by documents.

<p class='hang'>“G: No, no, I think so, too. Only, I did not know if you
spoke already to these people. I want that you once
more,—but no—not at all once more,—but
generally speaking—tell the following to Halifax
and Chamberlain: It is not correct that Germany
has given any ultimatum. This is a lie by
Schuschnigg, because the ultimatum was presented
to him by S-I, Glaise-Horstenau and Jury. Furthermore,
it is not true that we have presented an ultimatum
to the Federal President, but it also was given
by the others and as far as I know just a military-attache
came along, asked by S-I, because of a technical
question; he was supposed to ask whether in
case S-I would ask for the support of German troops,
Germany would grant this request. Furthermore, I
want to state that S-I asked us expressly by phone
as by telegram to send troops because he did not know
about the situation in Wiener-Neustadt, Vienna, and
so on; because arms had been distributed there. And
then he could not know how the Fatherland Front
might react since they always had had such a big
mouth.</p>

<p class='hang'>“R: Mr. Goering, tell me, how is the situation in Vienna,
is everything settled yet?</p>

<p class='hang'>“G: Yes. Yesterday I landed hundreds of airplanes with
some companies, in order to secure the airfield and
<span class='pageno' title='500' id='Page_500'></span>
they were received with joy. Today the advance unit
of the 17 division marches in, together with the Austrian
troops. Also I want to point out that the Austrian
troops did not withdraw but that they got together
and fraternized immediately with the German
troops, wherever they were stationed.” (<span class='it'>2949-PS,
Part W</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the previous conversations, these are interesting explanations—that
the ultimatum was made by Seyss-Inquart alone
and not by Goering; that Lt. Gen. Muff, the military attache, came
along merely to answer a technical question; and that Seyss-Inquart
asked expressly by telephone and by telegram for troops.
But perhaps this conversation can best be understood in light of
the actual physical scene of time and place:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>The British Foreign Office had protested the tactics employed
by the German Government. In a letter dated 12 March 1938
Ambassador Neville Henderson, at the British Embassy, Berlin,
wrote to Lord Halifax, Foreign Minister, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“My Lord,</p>

<p class='noindent'>“With reference to your telegram No. 79 of March 11th,
I have the honor to transmit to Your Lordship herewith a
copy of a letter which I addressed to Baron von Neurath in
accordance with the instructions contained therein and
which was delivered on the same evening.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The French Ambassador addressed a similar letter to
Baron von Neurath at the same time.” (<span class='it'>3045-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The enclosure was the note of March 11th from the British Embassy
to Von Neurath and it reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dear Reich Minister,</p>

<p class='noindent'>“My Government are informed that a German ultimatum
was delivered this afternoon at Vienna demanding <span class='it'>inter alia</span>,
the resignation of the Chancellor and his replacement by the
Minister of the Interior, a new Cabinet of which two-thirds
of the members were to be National Socialists, and the re-admission
<span class='pageno' title='501' id='Page_501'></span>
of the Austrian Legion to the country with the
duty of keeping order in Vienna.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I am instructed by my Government to represent immediately
to the German Government that if this report is
correct, H.M.G. in the U.K. feel bound to register a protest
in the strongest terms against such use of coercion backed
by force against an independent State in order to create a
situation incompatible with its national independence.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As the German Minister for Foreign Affairs has already
been informed in London, such action is found to produce
the greatest reactions of which it is impossible to foretell
the issues.” (<span class='it'>3045-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Von Neurath wrote a letter of response dated 12 March 1938.
He first objected to the fact that the British Government was
undertaking the role of protector of Austria’s independence:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the name of the German Government I must point out
here that the Royal British Government has no right to
assume the role of a protector of Austria’s independence.
In the course of diplomatic consultations on the Austrian
question, the German Government never left any doubt with
the Royal British Government that the formation of relations
between Germany and Austria could not be considered
anything but the inner concern of the German people and
that it did not affect third Powers.” (<span class='it'>3287-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in response to the assertions regarding Germany’s ultimatum,
Von Neurath set out what he stated to be the true version
of events:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Instead, the former Austrian Chancellor announced,
on the evening of the 9th of March, the surprising
and arbitrary resolution, decided on by himself, to hold an
election within a few days which, under the prevailing circumstances,
and especially according to the details provided
for the execution of the election, could and was to have the
sole purpose of oppressing politically the predominant majority
of the population of Austria. As could have been
foreseen, this procedure, being a flagrant violation of the
agreement of Berchtesgaden, led to a very critical point in
Austria’s internal situation. It was only natural that the
members of the then Austrian Cabinet who had not taken
part in the decision for an election protested very strongly
against it. Therefore, a crisis of the Cabinet occurred in
Vienna which, on the 11th of March, resulted in the resignation
of the former Chancellor and in the formation of a
new Cabinet. It is untrue that the Reich used forceful
<span class='pageno' title='502' id='Page_502'></span>
pressure to bring about this development. Especially the
assertion which was spread later by the former Chancellor,
that the German Government had presented the Federal
President with a conditional ultimatum, is a pure invention;
according to the ultimatum he had to appoint a
proposed candidate as Chancellor and to form a Cabinet
conforming to the proposals of the German Government,
otherwise the invasion of Austria by German troops was
held in prospect. The truth of the matter is that the question
of sending military or police forces from the Reich
was only brought up when the newly formed Austrian
Cabinet addressed a telegram, already published by the
press, to the German Government, urgently asked for the
dispatch of German troops as soon as possible in order to
restore peace and in order to avoid bloodshed. Faced with
the immediately threatening danger of a bloody civil war
in Austria, the German Government then decided to comply
with the appeal addressed to it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This being the state of affairs, it is impossible that the
attitude of the German Government, as asserted in your
letter, could lead to some unforeseeable reactions. A complete
picture of the political situation is given in the proclamation
which, at noon today, the German Reich Chancellor
has addressed to the German people. Dangerous reactions
to this situation can take place only if eventually a third
party should try to exercise its influence, contrary to the
peaceful intentions and legitimate aims of the German Government
on the shaping of events in Austria, which would
be incompatible with the right of self-government of the
German people.” (<span class='it'>3287-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In light of the documents already adverted to, this version of
events given by von Neurath is palpably untrue.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>F. <span class='it'>The Invasion and Absorption of Austria.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Invasion and Immediate Events: Control of Austria
in Fact.</span> In accordance with the directive of March 11 (<span class='it'>C-182</span>),
the German Army crossed the Austrian border at daybreak on
12 March 1938. Hitler issued a proclamation to the German people
announcing and purporting to justify the invasion (<span class='it'>TC-47</span>). The
British Government and the French Government filed protests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Government and the Austrian National Socialists
swiftly secured their grip on Austria. Seyss-Inquart welcomed
Hitler at Linz and they both expressed their joy over events of
the day. Seyss-Inquart in his speech declared Article 88 of the
Treaty of St. Germain inoperative. (<span class='it'>2485-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='503' id='Page_503'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A telegram from the American Legation in Vienna to the Secretary
of State, on 12 March 1938, gave a picture of what was happening
in Vienna:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Secretary of State,</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Statutes of Consolidation: Control of Austria in Law.</span> The
law-making machine was put to work on the task of consolidation.
First, Miklas was caused to resign as President (<span class='it'>2466-PS</span>). Seyss-Inquart
became both Chancellor and President. He then signed
a Federal Constitutional Law of 13 March 1938, for the Reunion
of Austria with the German Reich, which in turn was incorporated
into the Reich Statute of Reunion passed the same day (<span class='it'>2307-PS</span>).
This Federal Constitutional Law declared Austria to be a province
of the German Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By annexing Austria into the German Reich, Germany violated
Article 80 of the Treaty of Versailles, which provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany acknowledges and will respect the independence
of Austria within the frontier which may be fixed in a
treaty between that State and the principle Allied and Associated
Powers; she agrees that this independence shall be
inalienable, * * *”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Similarly, the Austrian invasion violated Article 88 of the Treaty
of St. Germain, which provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The independence of Austria is inalienable otherwise
than with the consent of the Council of the League of Nations.
Consequently Austria undertakes in the absence of
the consent of the said Council to abstain from any act which
might directly or indirectly or by any means whatever compromise
her independence, particularly, and until her admission
to membership of the League of Nations, by participation
in the affairs of another Power.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='504' id='Page_504'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This basic constitutional law provided for a plebiscite to be held
on 10 April 1938, concerning the question of reunion. But this
was a mere formality. The plebiscite could only confirm the union.
It could not undo Germany’s union with and control over Austria.
To illustrate the way in which legal consolidation was swiftly
assured, with Austria occupied by troops, it is not necessary to do
more than review some of the statutes passed within the month.
Hitler placed the Austrian Federal Army under his command and
required all members of the Army to take an oath of allegiance to
Hitler as their Supreme Commander (<span class='it'>2936-PS</span>). Public officials
of the Province of Austria were required to take an oath of office
swearing obedience to Hitler, Fuehrer of the German Reich and
People; Jewish officials, as defined, were not permitted to take the
oath. (<span class='it'>2311-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler and Frick signed a decree applying to Austria various
Reich laws, including the law of 1933 against formation of new
parties and the 1933 law for the preservation of unity of party
and state (2310-PS). Hitler, Frick, and Goering ordered that the
Reich Minister of the Interior be the central authority for carrying
out the reunion of Austria with the German Reich. (<span class='it'>1060-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with Germany’s extensive propaganda campaign
to ensure acceptability of the German regime, Goebbels established
a Reich Propaganda Office in Vienna (<span class='it'>2935-PS</span>). The ballot, addressed
to soldiers of the former Austrian Army as “German soldier”,
asked the voters whether they agreed with the “accomplishment”
and “ratification” on March 13, 1938, of the reuniting of
Austria with Germany (<span class='it'>1659-PS</span>). The groundwork was fully
laid before the holding of the plebiscite “for German men and
women of Austria” promised in the basic law of March 13.
(<span class='it'>2307-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Importance of Austria in Further Aggressions.</span>
Germany’s desire to consummate the Anschluss with Austria,
and its determination to execute that aim in the way and at the
time that it did (with threat of military force, quickly, and
despite political risks), was due to the importance of Austria in
its further plans of aggression. The conference of the conspirators
held on November 5, 1937, which laid plans for aggressive
war in Europe, outlined as objectives in Austria the conquest
of food, through expulsion of a million people, and an increase
in fighting strength in part through the improvement in frontier.
(<span class='it'>386-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Austria yielded material resources. Moreover she provided
ready cash, taken from the Jews and from the Austrian Government.
<span class='pageno' title='505' id='Page_505'></span>
One of the first orders passed after the Anschluss was an
order signed by Hitler, Frick, Schwerin von Krosigk, and Schacht,
for the transfer to the Reich of the assets of the Austrian National
Bank. (<span class='it'>2313-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Austria yielded human resources. Three months after Anschluss,
there was enacted a decree requiring 21-year-old men to
report for active military service. (<span class='it'>1660-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the acquisition of Austria improved the military strategic
position of the German Army. In a lecture delivered by General
Jodl, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, on 7 November
1943, at Munich, to the Gauleiters, Jodl reviewed the situation
in 1938:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Austrian ‘Anschluss’ in its turn, brought with it not
only the fulfilment of an old national aim but also had the
effect both of reinforcing our fighting strength and of materially
improving our strategic position. Whereas up till
then the territory of Czechoslovakia had projected in a most
menacing way right into Germany (a wasp waist in the
direction of France and an air base for the Allies, in particular
Russia), Czechoslovakia herself was now enclosed by
pincers. Its own strategic position had now become so
unfavorable that she was bound to fall a victim to any attack
pressed home with rigor before effective aid from the WEST
could be expected to arrive.” (<span class='it'>L-172</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators were now ready to carry out the second
part of their second phase of their aggressions. Czechoslovakia
was next.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg515a'>4. THE EXECUTION OF THE PLAN TO INVADE CZECHOSLOVAKIA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Development of the Nazi Program of Aggression.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the period 1933-1936 the conspirators had initiated a program
of rearmament designed to give the Third Reich military
strength and political bargaining power to be used against other
nations. Furthermore, beginning in the year 1936 they had embarked
on a preliminary program of expansion which, as it
turned out, was to last until March 1939. This program was
intended to shorten Germany’s frontiers, to increase its industrial
and food-reserves, and to place it in a position, both industrially
and strategically, from which the Nazis could launch a more
ambitious and more devastating campaign of aggression. At the
moment, in the early spring of 1938, when the Nazi conspirators
first began to lay concrete plans for the conquest of Czechoslovakia
they had reached approximately the halfway point in
this preliminary program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preceding autumn, at the conference in the Reichs Chancellery
on 5 November 1937, Hitler had set forth the program
which Germany was to follow. The events of this conference are
contained in the so-called Hossbach minutes. The question for
Germany, as the Fuehrer had informed his military commanders
at this meeting, is where the greatest possible conquest can be
<span class='pageno' title='516' id='Page_516'></span>
made at the lowest cost (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). At the top of his agenda stood
two countries: Austria and Czechoslovakia. On 12 March 1938
Austria was occupied by the German Army, and on the following
day it was annexed to the Reich. The time had come for a redefinition
of German intentions toward Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little more than a month later Hitler and Keitel met to
discuss plans for the envelopment and conquest of the Czechoslovak
State. On 21 April 1938, Hitler and Keitel discussed the
pretexts which Germany might develop to serve as an excuse
for a sudden and overwhelming attack. They considered the
provocation of a period of diplomatic squabbling which, growing
more serious, would lead to the excuse for war. In the
alternative, and this alternative they found to be preferable,
they planned to unleash a lightning attack as the result of an
“incident” of their own creation. Consideration was given to
the assassination of the German Ambassador at Prague to create
the requisite incident. The necessity of propaganda to guide the
conduct of Germans in Czechoslovakia and to intimidate the
Czechs was recognized. Problems of transport and tactics were
discussed with a view to overcoming all Czechoslovak resistance
within four days, thus presenting the world with a fait accompli
and forestalling outside intervention. (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 2</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus in mid-April 1938 the designs of the Nazi conspirators to
conquer Czechoslovakia had already reached the stage of practical
planning.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>The Background of Friendly Diplomatic Relations.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This conspiracy must be viewed against a background of
amicable German-Czech diplomatic relations. Although they had
in the fall of 1937 determined to destroy the Czechoslovak State,
the leaders of the German government were bound by a treaty of
arbitration and by assurances freely given to observe the sovereignty
of Czechoslovakia. By a formal treaty signed at Locarno
on 16 October 1925, Germany and Czechoslovakia agreed, with
certain exceptions, to refer to an arbitral tribunal or to the Permanent
Court of International Justice,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * all disputes of every kind between Germany
and Czechoslovakia with regard to which the parties are in
conflict as to their respective rights, and which it may not
be possible to settle amicably by the normal methods of
diplomacy. * * *” (<span class='it'>TC-14</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The preamble of this treaty stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The President of the German Empire and the President of
the Czechoslovak Republic; equally resolved to maintain
<span class='pageno' title='517' id='Page_517'></span>
peace between Germany and Czechoslovakia by assuring the
peaceful settlement of differences which might arise between
the two countries; declaring that respect for the rights
established by treaty or resulting from the law of nations is
obligatory for international tribunals; agreeing to recognize
that the rights of a State cannot be modified save with
its consent; and considering that sincere observance of the
methods of peaceful settlement of international disputes
permits of resolving, without recourse to force, questions
which may become the cause of division between States;
have decided to embody in a treaty their common intentions
in this respect. * * *” (<span class='it'>TC-14</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Formal and categoric assurances of their good will toward
Czechoslovakia were forthcoming from the Nazi conspirators as
late as March 1938. On 11 and 12 March 1938, at the time of
the annexation of Austria, Germany had a considerable interest
in inducing Czechoslovakia not to mobilize. At this time Goering
assured M. Mastny, the Czechoslovak Minister in Berlin, on
behalf of the German Government that German-Czech relations
were not adversely affected by the developments in Austria and
that Germany had no hostile intentions toward Czechoslovakia.
As a token of his sincerity Goering accompanied his assurance
with the statement: “<span class='it'>Ich gebe Ihnen mein Ehrenwort</span>” (“I give
you my word of honor”) (<span class='it'>TC-27</span>). At the same time von Neurath,
who was handling German foreign affairs during Ribbentrop’s
stay in London, assured M. Mastny on behalf of Hitler
and the German government that Germany still considered
herself bound by the Arbitration Convention of 1925 (<span class='it'>TC-27</span>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Planning for Aggression.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind the screen of these assurances the Nazi conspirators
proceeded with their military and political plans for aggression.
Ever since the preceding fall it had been established that the
immediate aim of German policy was the elimination of Austria
and Czechoslovakia. In both countries the Nazi conspirators
planned to undermine the will to resist by propaganda and by
fifth column activities, while the actual military preparations
were being developed. The Austrian operation, which received
priority for political and strategic reasons, was carried out in
February and March 1938. Thenceforth <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> planning
was devoted to Case Green (<span class='it'>Fall Gruen</span>), the designation given
to the operation against Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The military plans for Case Green had been drafted in outline
form as early as June 1937. The OKW top secret “Directive
<span class='pageno' title='518' id='Page_518'></span>
for the Unified Preparation of the Armed Forces for War”,
signed by von Blomberg on 24 June 1937 and promulgated to the
Army, Navy, and Luftwaffe for the year beginning 1 July 1937,
included as a probable warlike eventuality, for which a concentration
plan was to be drafted, Case Green (“War on two fronts
with the main struggle in the southeast”) (<span class='it'>C-175</span>). The original
section of this directive dealing with the “probable war” against
Czechoslovakia—it was later revised—opens with this supposition:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The war in the east can begin with a surprise German operation
against Czechoslovakia in order to parry the imminent
attack of a superior enemy coalition. The necessary conditions
to justify such an action politically and in the eyes of
international law must be created beforehand.” (<span class='it'>C-175</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After detailing possible enemies and neutrals in the event of
such action, the directive continues as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The task of the German Armed Forces is to make
their preparations in such a way that the bulk of all forces
can break into Czechoslovakia quickly, by surprise, and
with the greatest force, while in the West the minimum
strength is provided as rear cover for this attack.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The aim and object of this surprise attack by the German
Armed Forces should be to eliminate from the very beginning,
and for the duration of the war, the threat by Czechoslovakia
to the rear of the operations in the West, and to
take from the Russian Air Force the most substantial portion
of its operational base in Czechoslovakia. This must be
done by the defeat of the enemy armed forces and the occupation
of Bohemia and Moravia.” (<span class='it'>C-175</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The introduction to this directive sets forth as one of its guiding
principles the following statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The politically fluid world situation, which does not preclude
surprising incidents, demands constant preparedness for
war on the part of the German Armed Forces * * *
to make possible the military exploitation of politically favorable
opportunities should they occur.” (<span class='it'>C-175</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It ordered further work on the plan for mobilization without
public announcement “in order to put the Armed Forces in a
position to be able to begin a war suddenly which will take the
enemy by surprise both as regards strength and time of attack.”
(<span class='it'>C-175</span>). This directive is, of course, a directive for staff planning.
But the nature of the planning, and the very tangible and
ominous developments which resulted from it, give it a significance
that it would not have in another setting.
<span class='pageno' title='519' id='Page_519'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Planning along the lines of this directive was carried forward
during the fall of 1937 and the winter of 1937-1938. On the
political level this planning for the conquest of Czechoslovakia
received the approval and support of Hitler in the conference
with his military commanders-in-chief on 5 November 1937
(<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). In early March 1938, before the march into Austria,
Ribbentrop and Keitel were concerned over the extent of the
information about war aims against Czechoslovakia to be furnished
to Hungary. On 4 March 1938 Ribbentrop wrote to Keitel,
enclosing for Keitel’s confidential cognizance the minutes of a
conference with Sztojay, the Hungarian ambassador to Germany,
who had suggested an interchange of views (<span class='it'>2786-PS</span>). An
acknowledgment of the receipt of this letter was signed by Keitel
on 5 March. In his letter to Keitel, Ribbentrop said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have many doubts about such negotiations. In case we
should discuss with Hungary possible war aims against
Czechoslovakia, the danger exists that other parties as well
would be informed about this. I would greatly appreciate it
if you would notify me briefly whether any commitments
were made here in any respect.” (<span class='it'>2786-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>Development of Specific Plans.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At the 21 April meeting between Hitler and Keitel, specific
plans for the attack on Czechoslovakia were discussed for the first
time (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 2</span>). This meeting was followed in the late
spring and summer of 1938 by a series of memoranda and telegrams
advancing Case Green. These notes and communications
were carefully filed at Hitler’s headquarters by Major Schmundt,
the Fuehrer’s military adjutant, and were captured by American
troops in a cellar at Obersalzberg, Hitler’s headquarters, near
Berchtesgaden. This file, preserved intact, is document (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The individual items in this file tell more graphically than
any narrative the progress of the Nazi conspirators’ planning to
launch an unprovoked war against Czechoslovakia. From the
start the Nazi leaders displayed a lively interest in intelligence
data concerning Czechoslovak armament and defense. This
interest is reflected in <span class='it'>Item 4</span> of the Schmundt file, a telegram
from Colonel Zeitzler in General Jodl’s office of the OKW to
Schmundt at Hitler’s headquarters; <span class='it'>Item 12</span>, Short survey of
Armament of the Czech Army, dated Berlin 9 June 1938 and
initialed “Z” for Zeitzler; and <span class='it'>Item 13</span>, Questions of the Fuehrer,
dated Berlin, 9 June 1938 and classified “Most Secret”. The
following are four of the questions on which Hitler wanted
authoritative information:
<span class='pageno' title='520' id='Page_520'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'>“Question 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;Armament of the Czech Army?</p>

<p class='hang'>“Question 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;How many battalions, etc., are employed in
the West for the construction of emplacements?</p>

<p class='hang'>“Question 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the fortifications of Czechoslovakia still
occupied in unreduced strength?</p>

<p class='hang'>“Question 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;Frontier protection in the West?” (<span class='it'>388-PS,
Item 13</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>These questions were answered in detail by the OKW and initialed
by Colonel Zeitzler of Jodl’s staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a precaution against French and British action during the
attack on Czechoslovakia, it was necessary for the Nazi conspirators
to rush the preparation of fortification measures along the
western frontier of Germany. A telegram, presumably sent from
Schmundt in Berchtesgaden to Berlin, read in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Inform Colonel General von Brauchitsch and General
Keitel: * * * The Fuehrer repeatedly emphasized the
necessity of pressing forward greatly the fortification work
in the west.” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 8</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In May, June, July, and August of 1938 conferences between
Hitler and his political and military advisers resulted in the issuance
of a series of constantly revised directives for the attack.
It was decided that preparations for X-day, the day of the attack,
should be completed no later than 1 October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the afternoon of 28 May 1938 Hitler called a conference of
his principal military and political advisers in the winter garden
of the Reichs Chancellery in Berlin. This conference was the
occasion on which Hitler made known to the inner circle of the
Nazi conspirators the outlines of his plan to attack Czechoslovakia
and issued the necessary instructions. The meeting is described in
an affidavit of Fritz Wiedemann, who at that time was Hitler’s
adjutant:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“FRITZ WIEDEMANN, being first duly sworn, deposes and
says as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“From the month of January 1935 to January 1939 I served
as adjutant to Hitler. In this time my duties were to handle
correspondence and complaints addressed to the Fuehrer’s
office. Occasionally I attended conferences held by the
Fuehrer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I recall that on the afternoon of 28 May 1938 Hitler called a
conference in the winter garden of the Reichs Chancellery
of all the people who were important, from the Foreign Office,
the Army, and the Command Staffs. Those present at
this conference, as I recall, included Goering, Ribbentrop,
von Neurath, General Beck, Admiral Raeder, General Keitel,
<span class='pageno' title='521' id='Page_521'></span>
and General von Brauchitsch. On this occasion Hitler made
the following statement: ‘It is my unshakable will that
Czechoslovakia shall be wiped off the map.’ Hitler then revealed
the outlines of the plan to attack Czechoslovakia.
Hitler addressed himself to the Generals, saying: ‘So, we will
first tackle the situation in the East. Then I will give you
three to four years’ time, and then we will settle the situation
in the West.’ The situation in the West was meant to be
the war against England and France.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I was considerably shaken by these statements, and on
leaving the Reichs Chancellery I said to Herr von Neurath:
‘Well, what do you say to these revelations?’ Neurath
thought that the situation was not so serious as it appeared
and that nothing would happen before the spring of 1939.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“/s/&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Wiedemann.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>(<span class='it'>3037-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the months after the occupation of the Sudetenland Hitler
made no secret of this meeting. In a speech before the Reichstag
on 30 January 1939, Hitler spoke as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On account of this intolerable provocation which had been
aggravated by a truly infamous persecution and terrorization
of our Germans there, I had resolved to solve once and
for all, and this time radically, the Sudeten-German question.
On May 28 I ordered (1) that preparations should be made
for military action against this state by October 2. I ordered
(2) the immense and accelerated expansion of our
defensive front in the West.” (<span class='it'>2360-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Hitler also referred to this conference in his meeting with President
Hacha on 15 March 1939. (<span class='it'>2798-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days after this conference, on 30 May 1938, Hitler
issued the revised military directive for Case Green. This directive
is <span class='it'>Item 11</span> in the Schmundt file (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>). Entitled “Two
front war with main effort in the Southeast,” this directive
replaced the corresponding section, Part 2, Section II, of the
“Directive for Unified Preparation for War” promulgated by
von Blomberg on 24 June 1937 (<span class='it'>C-175</span>). This directive represented
a further development of the ideas for political and military
action discussed by Hitler and Keitel in their conference
on 21 April. It is an expansion of a rough draft submitted by
Keitel to Hitler on 20 May, which may be found as <span class='it'>Item 5</span> in the
Schmundt file (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>). It was signed by Hitler. Only five
copies were made. Three copies were forwarded with a covering
letter from Keitel to General von Brauchitsch for the Army, to
Raeder for the Navy, and to Goering for the Luftwaffe. In his
<span class='pageno' title='522' id='Page_522'></span>
covering memorandum Keitel noted that its execution must be
assured “as from 1 October 1938 at the latest”. (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 11</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document, which is the basic directive under which the
<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> carried out its planning for Case Green, reads as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'>“1. <span class='it'>Political Prerequisites.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is my unalterable decision to smash Czechoslovakia by
military action in the near future. It is the job of the political
leaders to await or bring about the politically and militarily
suitable moment.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“An inevitable development of conditions inside Czechoslovakia
or other political events in Europe creating a surprisingly
favorable opportunity and one which may never
come again may cause me to take early action.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The proper choice and determined and full utilization of a
favorable moment is the surest guarantee of success. Accordingly
the preparations are to be made at once.</p>

<p class='hang'>“2. <span class='it'>Political Possibilities for the Commencement of the
Action.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The following are necessary prerequisites for the intended
invasion:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“<span class='it'>a.</span></span><p class='listPara'>suitable obvious cause and, with it</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“<span class='it'>b.</span></span><p class='listPara'>sufficient political justification,</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“<span class='it'>c.</span></span><p class='listPara'>action unexpected by the enemy, which will find him
prepared to the least possible degree.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“From a military as well as a political standpoint the most
favorable course is a lightning-swift action as the result
of an incident through which Germany is provoked in an
unbearable way for which at least part of world opinion will
grant the moral justification of military action.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“But even a period of tension, more or less preceding a war,
must terminate in sudden action on our part—which must
have the elements of surprise as regards time and extent—before
the enemy is so advanced in military preparedness
that he cannot be surpassed.</p>

<p class='hang'>“3. <span class='it'>Conclusions for the Preparation of “Fall Gruen”.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>a.</span> For the <span class='it'>Armed War</span> it is essential that the surprise
element as the most important factor contributing to success
be made full use of by appropriate preparatory measures
already in peace-time and by an unexpectedly rapid
course of the action. Thus it is essential to create a situation
within the first four days which plainly demonstrates, to
hostile nations eager to intervene, the hopelessness of the
Czechoslovakian military situation and which at the same
<span class='pageno' title='523' id='Page_523'></span>
time will give nations with territorial claims on Czechoslovakia
an incentive to intervene immediately against
Czechoslovakia. In such a case, intervention by Poland and
Hungary against Czechoslovakia may be expected, especially
if France—due to the obvious pro-German attitude of Italy—fears,
or at least hesitates, to unleash a European war by
intervening against Germany. Attempts by Russia to give
military support to Czechoslovakia mainly by the Air Force
are to be expected. If concrete successes are not achieved by
the land operations within the first few days, a European
crisis will certainly result. This knowledge must give commanders
of all ranks the impetus to decided and bold action.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> The <span class='it'>Propaganda War</span> must on the one hand intimidate
Czechoslovakia by threats and soften her power of resistance,
on the other hand issue directions to national
groups for support in the Armed War and influence the
neutrals into our way of thinking. I reserve further directions
and determination of the date.</p>

<p class='hang'>“4. <span class='it'>Tasks of the Armed Forces.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Armed Forces Preparations are to be made on the following
basis:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> The mass of all forces must be employed against
Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> For the West, a minimum of forces are to be provided
as rear cover which may be required, the other frontiers
in the East against Poland and Lithuania are merely
to be protected, the Southern frontiers to be watched.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> The sections of the army which can be rapidly employed
must force the frontier fortifications with speed and
decision and must break into Czechoslovakia with the greatest
daring in the certainty that the bulk of the mobile army
will follow them with the utmost speed. Preparations for
this are to be made and timed in such a way that the sections
of the army which can be rapidly employed cross the
frontier at the appointed time <span class='it'>at the same time</span> as the penetration
by the Air Force before the enemy can become aware
of our mobilization.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For this, a timetable between Army and Air Force is
to be worked out in conjunction with OKW and submitted
to me for approval.</p>

<p class='hang'>“5. <span class='it'>Missions for the branches of the Armed Forces.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> <span class='it'>Army</span>: The basic principle of the surprise attack
against Czechoslovakia must not be endangered by the inevitable
time required for transporting the bulk of the field
<span class='pageno' title='524' id='Page_524'></span>
forces by rail nor the initiative of the Air Force be wasted.
Therefore it is first of all essential to the army that as many
assault columns as possible be employed at the same time as
the surprise attack by the Air Force. These assault columns—the
composition of each, according to their tasks at that
time—must be formed with troops which can be employed
rapidly owing to their proximity to the frontier or to motorization
and to special measures of readiness. It must be
the purpose of these thrusts to break into the Czechoslovakian
fortification lines at numerous points and in a strategically
favorable direction, to achieve a breakthrough or to
break them down from the rear. For the success of this
operation, cooperation with the Sudeten-German frontier
population, with deserters from the Czechoslovakian army,
with parachutists or airborne troops and with units of the
sabotage service will be of importance. The bulk of the
army has the task of frustrating the Czechoslovakian plan
of defense, of preventing the Czechoslovakian army from
escaping into Slovakia, of forcing a battle, of beating
the Czechoslovakian army and of occupying Bohemia and
Moravia speedily. To this end a thrust into the heart of
Czechoslovakia must be made with the strongest possible
motorized and armored units using to the full the first successes
of the assault columns and the effects of the Air
Force operations. The rear cover provided for the <span class='it'>West</span>
must be limited in numbers and quality to the extent which
suits the present state of fortifications. Whether the units
assigned this will be transported to the Western frontier
immediately or held back for the time being will be decided
in my special order. Preparations must however, be made
to enable security detachments to be brought up to the Western
frontier even during the strategic concentration ‘Gruen’.
Independent of this, a first security garrison must be improvised
from the engineers at present employed in constructing
fortifications and from formations of the Labor
Corps. The <span class='it'>remaining frontiers</span> as well as East Prussia, are
to be only weakly protected. But, always depending on the
political situation, the transfers by sea, of a part or even the
bulk of the active forces of East Prussia, into the Reich must
be taken into account.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> <span class='it'>Air Force.</span> While leaving a minimum of defensive
forces in the West, the Air Force is to be employed in bulk
in a surprise attack against Czechoslovakia. The frontier is
to be flown over at the same time as it is crossed by the first
section of the Army * * *.” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 11</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='525' id='Page_525'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>After detailed instructions for action by the Luftwaffe and by
the Navy the directive continues as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In war economy it is essential that in the field of the armament
industry a maximum-deployment of forces is made
possible through increased supplies. In the course of operations,
it is of value to contribute to the reinforcement of the
total war-economic strength by rapidly reconnoitering
and restarting important factories. For this reason the sparing
of Czechoslovakian industrial and works installations—insofar
as military operations permit.—can be of decisive
importance to us.” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 11</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, the Nazi conspirators, four months before
the date of their planned attack, were already looking forward
to the contribution which the Czech industrial plant would
make to the Nazi war economy. The last paragraph of this
directive reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“All preparations for sabotage and insurrection will be made
by OKW. They will be made, in agreement with and according
to the requirement of the branches of the Armed Forces,
so that their effects accord with the operations of the Army
and Air Force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three weeks later, on 18 June 1938, a draft for a new directive
was prepared and initialed by Keitel. It does not supersede
the 30 May directive. It reads, in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The immediate aim is a solution of the Czech problem by
my own, free decision; this stands in the foreground of my
political intentions. I am determined to use to the full every

<p class='noindent'>“However, I will decide to take action against Czechoslovakia
only if I am firmly convinced as in the case of the
occupation of the demilitarized zone and the entry into
Austria that France will not march and therefore England
will not intervene.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='526' id='Page_526'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The second and third parts of this directive contain general
directions for the deployment of troops and for precautionary
measures in view of the possibility that, during the execution
of Case Green, France or England might declare war on
Germany. Six pages of complicated schedules which follow
this draft in the original have not been translated into English.
These schedules, which constitute <span class='it'>Item 15</span> in the Schmundt
file (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>), give a timetable of specific measures for the preparation
of the Army, Navy, and Luftwaffe for the contemplated
action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corroboration for the documents in the Schmundt file is found
in three entries in General Jodl’s diary written in the spring of
1938 (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>). Although the first entry is not dated, it appears
to have been written several months after the annexation of
Austria:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“After annexation of Austria, the Fuehrer mentions that
there is no hurry to solve the Czech question because Austria
has to be digested first. Nevertheless preparations for Case
Green will have to be carried out energetically; they will
have to be newly prepared on the basis of the changed strategic
position because of the annexation of Austria. State of
preparations (see memorandum L I a of 19 April) reported
to the Fuehrer on 21 April.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The intention of the Fuehrer not to touch the Czech problem
as yet is changed because of the Czech strategic troop
concentration of 21 May, which occurs without any German
threat and without the slightest cause for it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Because of Germany’s self restraint, its consequences lead
to a loss of prestige of the Fuehrer, which he is not willing
to take once more. Therefore, the new order is issued for
‘green’ on 30 May.</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>23 May</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Major Schmundt reports ideas of the Fuehrer. Further
conferences, which gradually reveal the exact intentions of
the Fuehrer take place with the Chief of the Armed Forces
High Command (OKW) on 28 May, 3 and 9 June, see enclosures.

decision to destroy Czechoslovakia soon and thereby initiates
military preparation all along the line. The previous intentions
of the Army must be changed considerably in the direction
<span class='pageno' title='527' id='Page_527'></span>
of an immediate breakthrough into Czechoslovakia
right on D-Day (X-Tag), combined with aerial penetration
by the Air Force. Further details are derived from directive
for strategic concentration of the army. The whole contrast
becomes acute once more between the Fuehrer’s intuition
that we must do it this year and the opinion of the Army
that we cannot do it as yet, as most certainly the Western
Powers will interfere and we are not as yet equal to them.”
(<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>E. <span class='it'>Luftwaffe Participation in Early Planning for Case Green.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>During the spring and summer of 1938 the Luftwaffe was also
engaged in planning in connection with the forthcoming Case
Green and the further expansion of the Reich. A Top Secret
Document, dated 2 June 1938, was issued by Air Group Command
3 and entitled “Plan Study 1938: Instruction for Deployment and
Combat: Case Red.” (<span class='it'>R-150</span>). This is another staff plan, this time
for mobilization and employment of the Luftwaffe in the event of
war with France. It is given significance by the considerable
progress, at this date, in planning for the attack on Czechoslovakia.
Various possibilities under which war with France may
occur are noted: all of them are predicated on the assumption
of a German-Czech conflict:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“France will</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a</span> either interfere in the struggle between the Reich and
Czechoslovakia in the course of ‘Case Green’, or</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b</span> start hostilities simultaneously with Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c</span> It is possible but not likely that France will begin the
fight, while Czechoslovakia still remains aloof.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Regardless of whether France enters the war as a result of
‘Case Green’ or whether she makes the opening move of the
war simultaneously with Czechoslovakia, in any case the
mass of the German offensive formations will, in conjunction
with the Army, first deliver the decisive blow against
Czechoslovakia.” (<span class='it'>R-150</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By mid-summer direct and detailed planning for Case Green was
being carried out by the Luftwaffe. In early August, at the direction
of the Luftwaffe General Staff, the German Air Attache in
Prague reconnoitered the Freudenthal area of Czechoslovakia,
south of Upper Silesia, for suitable landing grounds. This action
is disclosed by a report of the Luftwaffe General Staff, Intelligence
Division, dated 12 August 1938 (<span class='it'>1536-PS</span>). This was a
Top Secret document, for General Officers only, of which only
<span class='pageno' title='528' id='Page_528'></span>
two copies were made. Attached as an enclosure was the report
of Major Moericke, the German air attache in Prague, dated 4
August 1938. The first four paragraphs of the enclosure read:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I was ordered by the General Staff of the Air Force to reconnoitre
the land in the region Freudenthal/Freihermersdorf
for landing possibilities.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For this purpose I obtained private lodgings in Freudenthal
with the manufacturer Macholdt, through one of my trusted
men in Prague.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I had specifically ordered this man to give no details about
me to M, particularly about my official position.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I used my official car (<span class='it'>Dienst Pkw</span>) for the journey to
Freudenthal, taking precautions against being observed.”
(<span class='it'>1536-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By 25 August the imminence of the attack on Czechoslovakia
compelled the issuance by the Luftwaffe of a detailed intelligence
memorandum entitled “Extended Case Green,” which consisted
of an estimate of possible action by the Western Powers during
the attack on Czechoslovakia (<span class='it'>375-PS</span>). This Top Secret memorandum
of the Intelligence Section of the Luftwaffe General
Staff is dated at Berlin, 25 August 1938. Based on the assumption
that Great Britain and France will declare war on Germany during
Case Green, this study contains an estimate of the strategy and
air strength of the Western Powers as of 1 October 1938, the target
date for Case Green. The first two sentences read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The basic assumption is that France will declare war
during the Case Green. It is presumed that France will
only decide upon war if active military assistance by Great
Britain is definitely assured.” (<span class='it'>375-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>F. <span class='it'>Negotiations with Italy and Hungary about Case Green.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Knowledge of pending action against Czechoslovakia was not
confined to a close circle of high officials of the Reich. During
the summer Germany’s allies, Italy and Hungary, were apprised
by one means or another of the plans of the Nazi conspirators. A
captured document from German Foreign Office files contains a
confidential memorandum of a conversation with the Italian ambassador,
Attolico, in Berlin on 18 July 1938 (<span class='it'>2800-PS</span>). At the
bottom is a handwritten note, headed “For the Reichsminister
[Ribbentrop] only.” This note reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Attolico added that we had made it unmistakably clear to
the Italians what our intentions are regarding Czechoslovakia.
He also knew the appointed time well enough so
that he could take perhaps a two months’ holiday now which
he could not do later on.
<span class='pageno' title='529' id='Page_529'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Giving an idea of the attitude of other governments
Attolico mentioned that the Roumanian government had
refused to grant application for leave to its Berlin Minister.”
(<span class='it'>2800-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A month later Mussolini sent a message to Berlin, asking that
he be told the date on which Case Green would take place. The
German response is outlined in a German Foreign Office note on
a conversation with Ambassador Attolico, signed “R” (for Ribbentrop)
and dated 23 August 1938:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the voyage of the ‘Patria’ Ambassador Attolico
explained to me that he had instructions to request the notification
of a contemplated time for German action against
Czechoslovakia from the German government.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In case the Czechs should again cause a provocation against
Germany, Germany would march. This would be tomorrow,
in six months or perhaps in a year. However, I could
promise him, that the German government, in case of an
increasing gravity of the situation or as soon as the Fuehrer
made his decision, would notify the Italian Chief of Government
as rapidly as possible. In any case, the Italian government
will be the first one Who will receive such a notification.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Four days later Attolico again asked to be notified of the date
of the pending attack. The conversation is recorded in another
German Foreign Office Memorandum:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ambassador Attolico paid me a visit today at 12 o’clock to
communicate the following:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“He had received another written instruction from Mussolini
asking that Germany communicate in time the probable
date of action against Czechoslovakia. Mussolini asked for
such notification, as Mr. Attolico assured me, in order ‘to
be able to take in due time the necessary measures on the
French frontier.’</p>

former demarche, that I could not impart any date to him,
that, however, in any case Mussolini would be the first one
to be informed of any decision.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hungary, which borders Czechoslovakia to the southeast, was
<span class='pageno' title='530' id='Page_530'></span>
from the first considered to be a possible participant in Case
Green. It will be recalled that in early March 1938 Keitel and
Ribbentrop had exchanged letters on the question of bringing Hungary
into the Nazi planning (<span class='it'>2786-PS</span>). At that time the decision
was in the negative. But by mid-August 1938 the Nazi conspirators
were attempting to persuade Hungary to join in the
attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From August 21st to 26th Admiral Horthy and some of his
ministers visited Germany. Admiral Horthy witnessed the
launching of the <span class='it'>Prince Eugen</span> and conferred with Hitler. There
were discussions of the Czechoslovak question. A captured German
Foreign Office document, signed by von Weizsäcker, records
the conversations between Hitler and Ribbentrop and a Hungarian
delegation consisting of Horthy, Imredy, and Kanya aboard
the S. S. <span class='it'>Patria</span> on 23 August 1938 (<span class='it'>2796-PS</span>). In this conference
Ribbentrop inquired about the Hungarian attitude in the event of
a German attack on Czechoslovakia and suggested that such an
attack would prove to be a good opportunity for Hungary. The
Hungarians, with the exception of Horthy, who wished to put the
Hungarian intention to participate on record, proved reluctant to
commit themselves. Thereupon Hitler emphasized Ribbentrop’s
statement, and said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Whoever wanted to join the meal would have to participate
in the cooking as well.” (<span class='it'>2796-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>Von Weizsäcker’s memorandum reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Von Ribbentrop inquired what Hungary’s attitude would
be if the Fuehrer would carry out his decision to answer a
new Czech provocation by force. The reply of the Hungarians
presented two kinds of obstacles: The Yugoslavian
neutrality must be assured if Hungary marches towards the
North and perhaps the East. Moreover, the Hungarian rearmament
had only been started and 1 or 2 more years’ time
for its development should be allowed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Von Ribbentrop then explained to the Hungarians that the
Yugoslavs would not dare to march while they were between
the pincers of the Axis Powers. Rumania alone would therefore
not move. England and France would also remain tranquil.
England would not recklessly risk her Empire. She
knew our newly acquired power. In reference to time, however,
for the above-mentioned situation, nothing definite
could be predicted since it would depend on Czech provocation.
Von Ribbentrop repeated that whoever desires revision
must exploit the good opportunity and participate.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Hungarian reply thus, remained a conditional one.
<span class='pageno' title='531' id='Page_531'></span>
Upon, the question of von Ribbentrop, what purpose the
desired General Staff conferences were to have, not much
more was brought forward than the Hungarian desire of a
mutual inventory of military material and preparedness for
the Czech conflict. The clear political basis for such a conference—the
time of Hungarian intervention—was not
obtained.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the meantime, more positive language was used by von
Horthy in his talk with the Fuehrer. He wished not to hide
his doubts with regard to the English attitude, but he wished
to put Hungary’s intention to participate on record. The
Hungarian Ministers were and remained, even later, more
skeptical since they feel more strongly about the immediate
danger for Hungary with its unprotected flanks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“When von Imredy had a discussion with the Fuehrer in the
afternoon, he was very relieved <span class='it'>when the Fuehrer explained
to him, that, in regard to the situation in question, he demanded
nothing of Hungary</span>. He himself would not know
the time. Whoever wanted to join the meal would have to
participate in the cooking as well. Should Hungary wish
conferences of the General Staffs, he would have no objections.”
(<span class='it'>2796-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>By the third day of the conference the Germans were able to note
that in the event of a German-Czech conflict Hungary would be
sufficiently armed for participation on 1 October. Another captured
German Foreign Office Memorandum reports a conversation
between Ribbentrop and Kanya on 25 August 1938. The last paragraph
of this memorandum states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Concerning Hungary’s military preparedness in case of a
German-Czech conflict von Kanya mentioned several days
ago that his country would need a period of one to two years
in order to develop adequately the armed strength of Hungary.
During today’s conversation von Kanya corrected this
remark and said that Hungary’s military situation was much
better. His country would be ready, as far as armaments
were concerned, to take part in the conflict by October 1st
of this year.” (<span class='it'>2797-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The signature to this document is not clear, but it appears to be
that of von Weizsäcker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These accounts of the German-Hungarian conference are corroborated
by General Jodl’s diary. The entry for 21-26 August
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>21-26 August</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Visit to Germany of the Hungarian Regent (<span class='it'>Reichsverweser</span>).
<span class='pageno' title='532' id='Page_532'></span>
Accompanied by the Prime Minister, the Minister
of Foreign Affairs and the Honved Minister v. Raatz.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“They arrive with the idea that in the course of a great war,
after a few years, and with the help of German troops, the
old state of Hungary can be reestablished. They leave with
the understanding that we have neither demands from, nor
claims against them, but that Germany will not stand for a
second provocation by Czechoslovakia, even if it should be
tomorrow. If they want to participate at that moment, it is
up to them.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany, however, will never play the role of arbitrator
between them and Poland. The Hungarians agree; but they
believe that, when the issue arises, a period of 48 hours
would be indispensable to them to find out Yugoslavia’s
attitude.” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The upshot of the talks with the Hungarians proved to be a
staff conference on 6 September. Jodl’s diary entry for that day
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>6 September</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Chief of General Staff, General of Artillery Halder, has
a conference with the Hungarian Chief of General Staff
Fischer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Before that he is briefed by me on the political attitude of
the Fuehrer—especially his order not to give any hint on
the exact moment. The same with OQI, General v. Stuelpnagel.”
(<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>G. <span class='it'>Final Preparations for the Attack.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The setting in which these events took place was that of the
Munich Pact and the international crisis which led to it. As this
crisis was developing in August and September 1938, frantic
efforts were being made by the statesmen of the world to preserve
the peace of the world. These statesmen, unfortunately, were
unaware of the plans and designs of the Nazi conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The documents captured by Allied troops reveal the hitherto-unknown
story underlying the Pact of Munich. These papers
reveal the fraud and deceit practiced by the Nazi conspirators in
negotiating the Pact of Munich as a stepping-stone toward further
aggression. The hope for peace which came with the Munich
Pact, which later turned out to be a snare and a deceit, was a trap
carefully set by the Nazi conspirators. The nature of the trap
is indicated by the events of the weeks just preceding the Munich
agreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a 1 October target date set for Case Green, there was a
<span class='pageno' title='533' id='Page_533'></span>
noticeable increase in the tempo of the military preparations in
late August and September. Actual preparations for the attack
on Czechoslovakia were well under way. The agenda of the Nazi
conspirators were devoted to technical details: the timing of
X-day, questions of mobilization, questions of transport and
supply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 26 August Jodl initialed a memorandum entitled “Timing
of the X-Order and the Question of Advance Measures” (<span class='it'>388-PS,
Item 17</span>). This memorandum demonstrates clearly the complicity
of the OKW and of Keitel and Jodl, in the fabrication of an incident
as an excuse for war. It reveals the character of the attack
that Germany was preparing to launch. The memorandum reads
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>TIMING OF THE X-ORDER AND THE QUESTION OF
ADVANCE MEASURES</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Luftwaffe’s endeavor to take the enemy air forces by
surprise at their peace-time airports justifiably leads them
to oppose measures taken in advance of the X-order and to
the demand that the X-order itself be given sufficiently late
on X minus 1 to prevent the fact of Germany’s mobilization
becoming known to Czechoslovakia on that day.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The army’s efforts are tending in the opposite direction. It
intends to let OKW initiate all advance measures between
X minus 3 and X minus 1, which will contribute to the
smooth and rapid working of the mobilization. With this in
mind OKW <span class='it'>also demands</span> that the X order be given <span class='it'>not later
than 1400 on X minus 1</span>.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“To this the following must be said:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Operation (Aktion) Green will be set in motion by means
of an ‘incident’ in Czechoslovakia which will give Germany
provocation for military intervention. The fixing of the
<span class='it'>exact time</span> for this incident is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It must come at a time when weather conditions are favorable
for our superior air forces to go into action and at an
hour which will enable authentic news of it to reach us on
the afternoon of X minus 1.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It can then be spontaneously answered by the giving of the
X order at 1400 on X minus 1.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On X minus 2 the Navy, Army and Air Force will merely
receive an advance warning.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If the <span class='it'>Fuehrer</span> intends to follow this plan of action, all further
discussion is superfluous.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For then no advance measures may be taken before X minus
1 for which there is not an innocent explanation as we
<span class='pageno' title='534' id='Page_534'></span>
shall otherwise appear to have manufactured the incident.
Orders for absolutely essential advance measures must be
given in good time and camouflaged with the help of the
numerous maneuvers and exercises.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Also, the question raised by the Foreign Office as to
whether all Germans should be called back in time from
prospective enemy territories must in no way lead to the
conspicuous departure from Czechoslovakia of any German
subjects before the incident.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Even a warning of the diplomatic representatives in
Prague is impossible before the first air-attack, although
the consequences could be very grave in the event of their
becoming victims of such an attack (e.g., death of representatives
of friendly or confirmed neutral powers.)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If, for technical reasons, the <span class='it'>evening hours</span> should be considered
desirable for the incident, then the following day
cannot be X day, but it must be the day after that.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In any case we must act on the principle that nothing must
be done before the incident which might point to mobilization,
and that the swiftest possible action must be taken
after the incident. (X-Fall)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is the purpose of these notes to point out what a great
interest the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> has in the incident and that it must
be informed of the Fuehrer’s intentions in good time—insofar
as the <span class='it'>Abwehr</span> Section is not also charged with the organization
of the incident.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I request that the Fuehrer’s decision be obtained on these
points.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“J [Jodl] 26/8.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>(<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 17</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In handwriting at the bottom of the page are the notes of
Schmundt, Hitler’s adjutant. These reveal that the memorandum
was submitted to Hitler on 30 August; that Hitler agreed to act
along these lines; and that Jodl was so notified on 31 August.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 3 September Keitel and von Brauchitsch met with Hitler
at the Berghof. Again Schmundt kept notes of the conference
(<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 18</span>). The first three paragraphs of these minutes
state:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Gen. Ob. v. Brauchitsch</span>: Reports on the exact time of the
transfer of the troops to ‘exercise areas’ for ‘<span class='it'>Gruen</span>’. Field
units to be transferred on 28 Sept. From here will then be
ready for action. When X Day becomes known, field units
carry out exercises in opposite directions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Fuehrer</span>: Has objection. Troops assemble field units a 2-day
<span class='pageno' title='535' id='Page_535'></span>
march away. Carry out camouflage exercises everywhere.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“?:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OKH must know when X-day is by 1200 noon,
27 September.” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 18</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>During the remainder of the conference Hitler gave his views
on the strategy the German armies should employ and the strength
of the Czech defenses they would encounter. He spoke of the possibility
of “drawing in the Henlein people.” The situation in the
West still troubled him. Schmundt noted:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer gives orders for the development of the Western
fortifications; improvement of advance positions around
Aachen and Saarbrucken. Construction of 300 to 400 battery
positions (1600 artillery pieces.)” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 18</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Five days later General Stulpnagel asked Jodl for written
assurance that the OKH would be informed five days in advance
about the pending action. In the evening Jodl conferred with
Luftwaffe generals about the coordination of ground and air
operations at the start of the attack. The 8 September entry in
General Jodl’s diary states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>8 September</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“General Stulpnagel OQI asks for written assurance that
the Army High Command will be informed five days in advance
if the plan is to take place. I agree and add that the
overall meteorological situation can be estimated to some
extent only for two days in advance, and that therefore the
plans may be changed up to this moment (D-day-2) (X-2
TAGE).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“General Stulpnagel mentions that for the first time he wonders
whether the previous basis of the plan is not being
abandoned. It presupposed that the Western Powers would
not interfere decisively. It gradually seems as if the Fuehrer
would stick to his decision even though he may no longer be
of this opinion. It must be added that Hungary is at least
moody and that Italy is reserved.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I must admit that I am worrying too, when comparing the
change of opinion about political and military potentialities,
according to directives of 24 June, 5 Nov 37, 7 Dec 37, 30
May 38, with the last statements.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In spite of that one must be aware of the fact that the other
nations will do everything they can to apply pressure to us.
We must pass this test of nerves, but because only very few
people know the art of withstanding this pressure successfully,
the only possible solution is to inform only a very
small circle of officers of news that causes us anxiety, and
<span class='pageno' title='536' id='Page_536'></span>
not to have it circulate through anterooms as heretofore.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1800 hours to 2100 hours: Conference with Chief of Army
High Command and Chief of General Staff of the Air Force
(present were Jeschonnek, Kammhuber, Sternburg and
myself).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We agree about the promulgation of the D-Day order
(X-Befehl), (X-1, 4 o’clock) and preannouncement to the
Air Force (D-Day-1, X-1 day, 7 o’clock). The ‘Y time’ has
yet to be examined; some formations have an approach flight
of one hour.” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Late on the evening of the following day, 9 September, Hitler
met with Keitel and Generals von Brauchitsch and Halder at
Nurnberg. Dr. Todt, the construction engineer, later joined the
conference, which lasted from 10 in the evening until 3:30 the
following morning. Schmundt’s minutes are <span class='it'>Item 19</span> in his file
(<span class='it'>388-PS</span>). In this meeting General Halder reviewed the missions
assigned to four of the German armies being committed to
the attack: the 2d, 10th, 12th, and 14th. With his characteristic
enthusiasm for military planning, Hitler then delivered a soliloquy
on strategic considerations which should be taken into account
as the attack developed. The discussions proceeded as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>General Oberst v. Brauchitsch</span>: Employment of motorized
divisions was based on the difficult rail situation in
Austria and the difficulties in getting other divisions (ready
to march) into the area at the right time. In the West vehicles
will have to leave on the 20th of Sept, if X-Day
remains as planned. Workers leave on the 23d, by relays.
Specialist workers remain according to decision by Army
Command 2.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>The Fuehrer</span>: Doesn’t see why workers have to return
home as early as X-11. Other workers and people are also
on the way on mobilization day. Also the RR cars, they
will stand around unnecessarily later on.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>General Keitel</span>: Workers are not under the jurisdiction of
district commands (Bezirks Kdos.) in the West. Trains
must be assembled.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>v. Brauchitsch</span>: 235,000 men RAD (Labour Service) will
be drafted. 96 Construction Bns will be distributed (also
in the east). 40,000 trained laborers stay in the West.”
(<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 19</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From this date forward the Nazi conspirators were occupied
with the intricate planning required before the attack. On 11
September Jodl conferred with a representative of the Propaganda
<span class='pageno' title='537' id='Page_537'></span>
Ministry about methods of refuting German violations of
International Law and exploiting those of the Czechs. The 11
September entry in the Jodl diary reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>11 September</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the afternoon conference with Secretary of State Jahnke
from the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda
on imminent common tasks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The joint preparations for refutation (<span class='it'>Wiederlegung</span>) of
our own violations of international law, and the exploitation
of its violations by the enemy, were considered particularly
important.” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This discussion developed into a detailed study compiled by
Section L, Jodl’s section of the OKW (<span class='it'>C-2</span>). Seven copies of this
captured document were prepared and distributed on 1 October
1938 to the OKH, the OKM, the Luftwaffe, and the Foreign Office.
In this study anticipated violations of International Law in the
invasion of Czechoslovakia are listed and counter-propaganda
suggested for the use of the propaganda agencies. This document
is presented in a tabular form, in which possible incidents are
listed in the left-hand column. In the second column are given
specific examples of the incidents; in the third and fourth columns
the position to be taken toward these incidents under International
Law and under the laws of warfare is set forth; the fifth column,
which is blank, is reserved for the explanation to be offered by
the Propaganda Minister. The first 10 hypothetical incidents, for
which justification must be found, and which are listed in column
b of the table are as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1<span class='it'>a</span>. In an air-raid on Prague the British Embassy is destroyed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Englishmen or Frenchmen are injured or killed;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The Hradschin is destroyed in an air raid on Prague.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. On account of a report that the Czechs have used gas,
the firing of gas projectiles is ordered.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. Czech civilians, not recognizable as soldiers, are caught
in the act of sabotage (destruction of important bridges,
destruction of foodstuffs and fodder) are discovered looting
wounded or dead soldiers and thereupon shot.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“6. Captured Czech soldiers or Czech civilians are detailed
to do road work or to load munitions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“7. For military reasons it is necessary to requisition billets,
foodstuffs and fodder from the Czech population. As
a result the latter suffer from want.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“8. Czech population is, for military reasons, compulsorily
evacuated to the rear area.
<span class='pageno' title='538' id='Page_538'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“9. Churches are used for military accommodation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“10. In the course of their duty, German aircraft fly over
Polish territory where they are involved in an air battle
with Czech aircraft.” (<span class='it'>C-2</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From Nurnberg, on 10 September, Hitler issued an order bringing
the <span class='it'>Reichsarbeitsdienst</span>, the German labor service, under the
OKW. This top secret order, of which 25 copies were made, provides
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The whole RAD organization comes under the command
of the Supreme Command of the Army effective 15
September.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The Chief of OKW decides on the first commitments
of this organization in conjunction with the Reichs Labor
Leader (<span class='it'>Reichsarbeitsfuehrer</span>) and on assignments from
time to time to the Supreme Commands of the Navy, Army
and Air Force. Where questions arise with regard to competency
he will make a final decision in accordance with
my instructions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. For the time being this order is to be made known
only to the departments and personnel immediately concerned.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;ADOLF HITLER.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>(<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 20</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Four days later, on 14 September, Keitel issued detailed instructions
for the employment of specific RAD units. This order is
<span class='it'>Item 21</span> in the Schmundt file. A further order issued by Jodl on
16 September specified RAD units which would receive military
training. This is <span class='it'>Item 24</span> in the Schmundt file. (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two entries in Jodl’s diary give further indications of the problems
of the OKW in this period of mid-September, just two weeks
before the anticipated X-day. The entries for 15 and 16 September
read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>15 September</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the morning conference with Chief of Army High Command
and Chief of General Staffs of Army and Air Forces;
the question was discussed what could be done if the Fuehrer
insists on advancement of the date, due to the rapid development
of the situation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>16 September</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“General Keitel returns from the Berghof at 1700 hours.
He graphically describes the results of the conference between
Chamberlain and the Fuehrer. The next conference
will take place on the 21st or 22nd in Godesberg.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“With consent of the Fuehrer, the order is given in the
<span class='pageno' title='539' id='Page_539'></span>
evening by the Armed Forces High Command to the Army
High Command and to the Ministry of Finance, to line up
the VGAD along the Czech border.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the same way, an order is issued to the railways to have
the empty rolling stock kept in readiness clandestinely for
the strategic concentrations of the Army, so that it can
be transported starting 28 September.” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The order to the railroads to make rolling stock available which
General Jodl referred to appears as <span class='it'>Item 22</span> in the Schmundt
file. In this order Keitel told the railroads to be ready by 28
September but to continue work on the western fortifications even
after 20 September in the interest of camouflage. The first and
fourth paragraphs of this order provide:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsbahn must provide trains of empty trucks in
great numbers by September 28 for the carrying out of
mobilization exercises. This task now takes precedence over
all others.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“However, in accordance with the Fuehrer’s directive, every
effort should be made to continue to supply the materials in
as large quantities as feasible even after 20 September 1938,
and this for reasons of camouflage as well as in order to continue
the important work of the Lines.” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 22</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The penultimate stage of the aggression began on 18 September.
From that day until the 28th a series of orders were issued advancing
preparations for the attack. These orders are included
in the Schmundt file (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>). On the 18th the commitment
schedule for the five participating armies—the 2d, 8th, 10th, 12th,
and 14th—was set forth (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 26</span>). Hitler approved the
secret mobilization of five divisions in the west to protect the German
rear during Case Green (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 31</span>). Further discussions
were held between the Army and the Luftwaffe about the
time of day for the attack. Conference notes initialed by Jodl and
dated 27 September reveal the difference in views. These notes
are <span class='it'>Item 54</span> in the Schmundt file. The first three paragraphs read:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>COORDINATED TIME OF ATTACK BY ARMY AND
AIR FORCES ON X DAY.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“As a matter of principle, every effort should be made for
a coordinated attack by Army and Air Forces on X Day.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Army wishes to attack at dawn, i.e., about 0615. It
also wishes to conduct some limited operations in the previous
night, which however, would not alarm the entire Czech

<p class='pindent'>On the same day, 27 September, Keitel sent a most secret memorandum
to Hess and the Reichsfuehrer SS, Himmler, for the
guidance of Nazi Party officials. This memorandum is <span class='it'>Item 32</span>

to comply with the demands of the Army during the secret
mobilization in such matters as turning over equipment and facilities.

<p class='pindent'>Two additional entries from Jodl’s diary reveal the extent to
which the Nazi conspirators carried forward their preparations

<p class='pindent'>H. <span class='it'>The Campaign Within Czechoslovakia.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The military preparations for aggression against Czechoslovakia
had not been carried out in vacuo. They had been preceded
by a skillfully conceived campaign designed to promote civil
disobedience to the Czechoslovak State. Using the techniques they
had already developed in other ventures, the Nazi conspirators
over a period of years used money, propaganda, and force to undermine
Czechoslovakia. In this program the Nazis focussed their
attention on the persons of German descent living in the Sudetenland,
a mountainous area bounding Bohemia and Moravia on
the north, west, and south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Czechoslovak government’s official report for the prosecution
and trial of German major war criminals, entitled “German
Crimes Against Czechoslovakia,” shows the background of the
subsequent Nazi intrigue. (<span class='it'>998-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nazi agitation in Czechoslovakia dated from the earliest days
of the NSDAP. In the years following the First World War a
German National Socialist Workers Party (DNSAP), which
maintained close contact with Hitler’s NSDAP, was active in the
Sudetenland. In 1932, ring-leaders of the <span class='it'>Sudeten Volksport</span>, an
organization corresponding to the Nazi SA, openly endorsed the
21 points of Hitler’s program, the first of which demanded the
union of all Germans in a Greater Germany. Soon thereafter
they were charged with planning armed rebellion on behalf of a
foreign power and were sentenced for conspiracy against the
Czech Republic. Late in 1933 the National Socialist Party of
Czechoslovakia forestalled its dissolution by voluntary liquidation,
and several of its chiefs escaped across the frontier. For a
year thereafter Nazi activity in Czechoslovakia continued underground.
(<span class='it'>998-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 1 October 1934, with the approval and at the urging of the
<span class='pageno' title='543' id='Page_543'></span>
Nazi conspirators, Konrad Henlein, an instructor of gymnastics,
established the “German Home Front” (<span class='it'>Deutsche Heimatfront</span>),
which the following spring became the Sudeten German Party
(<span class='it'>Sudeten-deutsche Partei—SDP</span>). Profiting from the experience
of the Czech National Socialist Party, Henlein denied any
connection with the German Nazis. He rejected pan-Germanism,
and professed his respect for individual liberties and his loyalty
to “honest democracy” and to the Czech state. His party, none-the-less,
was built on the basis of the Nazi <span class='it'>Fuehrerprinzip</span>, and
he became its Fuehrer. By 1937, when the power of Hitler’s
Germany had become manifest, Henlein and his followers were
striking a more aggressive note, demanding, without definition,
“complete Sudeten autonomy“. The SDP laid proposals before
the Czech Parliament which would, in substance, have created a
state within a state. (<span class='it'>998-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the annexation of Austria in March 1938 the Henleinists,
who were now openly organized after the Nazi model, intensified
their activity. Undisguised anti-Semitic propaganda started in
the Henlein press; the campaign against “bolshevism” was intensified;
terrorism in the Henlein-dominated communities increased.
A storm troop organization, patterned and trained on the principles
of the Nazi SS, was established, known as the FS (<span class='it'>Freiwilliger
Selbstschutz</span>, or Voluntary Vigilantes). On 24 April
1938, in a speech to the Party Congress in Karlovy Vary, Henlein
came into the open with his “Karlsbad Program”. In this speech,
which echoed Hitler in tone and substance, Henlein asserted the
right of the Sudeten-Germans to profess “German political philosophy”,
which, it was clear, meant National Socialism. (<span class='it'>998-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>3061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the summer of 1938 wore on, the Henleinists used every
technique of the Nazi Fifth Column. As summarized in the Czech
official report, these included:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Espionage.</span> Military espionage was conducted by the
SDP, the FS, and by other members of the German minority on
behalf of Germany. Czech defenses were mapped, and information
on Czech troop movements was furnished to the German
authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Nazification of German Organizations in Czechoslovakia.</span>
The Henleinists systematically penetrated the whole life of the
German population of Czechoslovakia. Associations and social
and cultural centers gradually underwent “<span class='it'>Gleichschaltung</span>”,
i.e., “purification”, by the SDP. Among the organizations conquered
by the Henleinists were sport societies, rowing clubs, associations
of ex-service men, and choral societies. The Henleinists
<span class='pageno' title='544' id='Page_544'></span>
were particularly interested in penetrating as many business
institutions as possible and in bringing over to their side the
directors of banks, the owners or directors of factories, and the
managers of commercial firms. In the case of Jewish ownership
or direction they attempted to secure the cooperation of the clerical
and technical staffs of the institution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>German Direction and Leadership.</span> The Henleinists
maintained permanent contact with the Nazi officials designated
to direct operations within Czechoslovakia. Meetings in Germany
at which Henleinists were exhorted and instructed in Fifth Column
activity were camouflaged by being held in conjunction
with <span class='it'>Saenger Feste</span> (choral festivals), gymnastic shows and
assemblies, and commercial gatherings such as the Leipzig Fair.
Whenever the Nazi conspirators needed incidents for their war of
nerves, it was the duty of the Henleinists to supply them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Propaganda.</span> Disruptive and subversive propaganda was
beamed at Czechoslovakia in German broadcasts and was echoed
in the German press. Goebbels called Czechoslovakia a “nest of
Bolshevism” and spread the false report of “Russian troops and
airplanes” centered in Prague. Under direction from the Reich
the Henleinists maintained whispering propaganda in the Sudetenland,
which contributed to the mounting tension and to the
creation of incidents. Illegal Nazi literature was smuggled from
Germany and widely distributed in the border regions. The Henlein
press more or less openly espoused Nazi ideology to the
German population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Murder and Terrorism.</span> The Nazi conspirators provided
the Henleinists, and particularly the FS, with money and arms
with which to provoke incidents and to maintain a state of permanent
unrest. Gendarmes, customs officers, and other Czech
officials were attacked. A boycott was established against Jewish
lawyers, doctors, and tradesmen. The Henleinists terrorized the
non-Henlein population, and the Nazi Gestapo crossed into border
districts to carry Czechoslovak citizens across the border to
Germany. In several cases political foes of the Nazis were murdered
on Czech soil. Nazi agents murdered Professor Theodor
Lessing in 1933 and the engineer Formis in 1935. Both men
were anti-Nazis who had escaped from Germany after Hitler
came to power and had sought refuge in Czechoslovakia. (<span class='it'>998-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>3061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some time afterwards, when there was no longer need for
pretense and deception, Konrad Henlein made a clear and frank
statement of the mission assigned to him by the Nazi conspirators.
This statement was made in a lecture by Konrad Henlein
<span class='pageno' title='545' id='Page_545'></span>
quoted on page 29 of “Four Fighting Years”, a publication
of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In this lecture,
delivered by Henlein on 4 March 1941 in the Auditorium of the
University of Vienna under the auspices of the <span class='it'>Wiener Verwaltungsakadamie</span>,
he discussed the “fight for the liberation of the
Sudetens” in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“National Socialism soon swept over us Sudeten-Germans.
Our struggle was of a different character from that in Germany.
Although we had to behave differently in public we
were, of course, secretly in touch with the National Socialist
revolution in Germany so that we might be a part of it. The
struggle for Greater Germany was waged on Sudeten soil,
too. This struggle could be waged only by those inspired by
the spirit of National Socialism, persons who were true
followers of our Fuehrer, whatever their outward appearance.
Fate sought me out to be the leader of the national
group in its final struggle. When * * * in autumn,
1933, the leaders of the NSDAP asked me to take over the
political leadership of the Sudeten-Germans, I had a difficult
problem to solve. Should the National Socialist Party continue
to be carried on illegally or should the movement, in
the interest of the self-preservation of the Sudeten-Germans
and in order to prepare their return to the Reich, wage its
struggle under camouflage and by methods which appeared
quite legal to the outside world? For us Sudeten-Germans
only the second alternative seemed possible, for the preservation
of our national group was at stake. It would certainly
have been easier to exchange this hard and mentally
exhausting struggle for the heroic gesture of confessing
allegiance to National Socialism and entering a Czechoslovak
prison. But it seemed more than doubtful whether by this
means we could have fulfilled the political task of destroying
Czechoslovakia as a bastion in the alliance against the German
Reich.” (<span class='it'>2863-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I. <span class='it'>Evidence Implicating Nazi Conspirators in Czechoslovak
Agitation.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The foregoing account of Nazi intrigue in Czechoslovakia is
the outline of this conspiracy as it had been pieced together by
the Czechoslovak government early in the summer of 1945. Since
then captured documents and other information made available
since the defeat of Germany have clearly and conclusively demonstrated
the implication, which hitherto could only be deduced,
of the Nazi conspirators in the Sudetenland agitation.
<span class='pageno' title='546' id='Page_546'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A telegram sent from the German Legation in Prague on 16
March 1938 to the Foreign Office in Berlin, presumably written
by the German Minister, Eisenlohr, proves conclusively that the
Henlein movement was an instrument of the Nazi conspirators
(<span class='it'>3060-PS</span>). The Henlein party, it appears from this telegram,
was directed from Berlin and from the German Legation in
Prague. It could have no policy of its own; even the speeches
of its leaders had to be coordinated with the German authorities.
This telegram reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Rebuff to Frank has had a salutary effect. Have thrashed
out matters with Henlein, who recently had shunned me, and
with Frank separately and received following promises;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The line of German Foreign Policy as transmitted by
the German Legation is exclusively decisive for policy and
tactics of the Sudeten German Party. My directives are to
be complied with implicitly.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Public speeches and the press will be coordinated uniformly
with my approval. The editorial staff of “<span class='it'>Zeit</span>”
(Time) is to be improved.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Party leadership abandons the former intransigent line
which in the end might lead to political complications and
adopts a line of gradual promotion of Sudeten-German interests.
The objectives are to be set in every case with my participation
and to be promoted by parallel diplomatic action.
Laws for the protection of nationalities (<span class='it'>Volksschutzgesetze</span>)
and ‘territorial autonomy’ are no longer to be stressed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. If consultations with Berlin agencies are required or
desired before Henlein issues important statements on his
program, they are to be applied for and prepared through
the Mission.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. All information of the Sudeten German Party for German
agencies is to be transmitted through the Legation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“6. Henlein will establish contact with me every week, and
will come to Prague at any time if requested.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I now hope to have the Sudeten German Party under firm
control, as this is more than ever necessary for coming
developments in the interest of foreign policy. Please inform
ministries concerned and Mittelstelle (Central Office for
Racial Germans) and request them to support this uniform
direction of the Sudeten German Party.” (<span class='it'>3060-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The dressing-down administered by Eisenlohr to Henlein had
the desired effect. The day after the telegram was dispatched
from Prague, Henlein addressed a humble letter to Ribbentrop,
asking an early personal conversation (<span class='it'>2789-PS</span>). This letter,
<span class='pageno' title='547' id='Page_547'></span>
dated 17 March 1938, and captured in the German Foreign
Office files, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Most honored Minister of Foreign Affairs:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In our deeply felt joy over the fortunate turn of events in
Austria we feel it our duty to express our gratitude to all
those who had a share in this new grand achievement of our
Fuehrer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I beg you, most honored Minister, to accept accordingly the
sincere thanks of the Sudeten-Germans herewith.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We shall show our appreciation to the Fuehrer by doubled
efforts in the service of the Greater German policy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The new situation requires a reexamination of the Sudeten
German policy. For this purpose I beg to ask you for the
opportunity for a very early personal talk.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of the necessity of such a clarification I have postponed
the Nation-wide Party Congress, originally scheduled
for 26th and 27th of March, 1938, for 4 weeks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I would appreciate if the Minister, Dr. Eisenlohr, and
one of my closest associates would be allowed to participate
in the requested talks.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>“Heil Hitler,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“Loyally yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“/s/&nbsp;&nbsp;Konrad Henlein.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>(<span class='it'>2789-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This letter makes it clear that Henlein was quite aware that the
seizure of Austria made possible the adoption of a new policy
toward Czechoslovakia. It also reveals that he was already in
close enough contact with Ribbentrop and the German minister
in Prague to feel free to suggest “early personal” talks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop was not unreceptive to Henlein’s suggestion. The
conversations Henlein had proposed took place in the Foreign
Office in Berlin on 29 March 1938. The previous day Henlein had
conferred with Hitler himself. The captured German Foreign
Office notes of the conference on 29 March read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsminister started out by emphasizing the necessity
to keep the conference which had been scheduled strictly
a secret; he then explained, in view of the directives which
the Fuehrer himself had given to Konrad Henlein personally
yesterday afternoon that there were two questions which
were of outstanding importance for the conduct of policy of
the Sudeten German Party * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='548' id='Page_548'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The aim of the negotiations to be carried out by the Sudeten
German party with the Czechoslovakian Government is
finally this: to avoid entry into the Government by the extension
and gradual specification of the demands to be made.
It must be emphasized clearly in the negotiations that the
Sudeten German Party alone is the party to the negotiations
with the Czechoslovakian Government, not the Reich Cabinet
(<span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>). The Reich Cabinet itself must refuse to
appear toward the Government in Prague or toward London
and Paris as the advocate or peacemaker of the Sudeten
German demands. It is a self-evident prerequisite that during
the impending discussion with the Czechoslovak Government
the Sudeten-Germans would be firmly controlled by
Konrad Henlein, would maintain quiet and discipline, and
would avoid indiscretions. The assurances already given by
Konrad Henlein in this connection were satisfactory.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Following these general explanations of the Reich Minister
the demands of the Sudeten German Party from the
Czechoslovak Government as contained in the enclosure were
discussed and approved in principle. For further cooperation,
Konrad Henlein was instructed to keep in the closest
possible touch with the Reichminister and the Head of the
Central Office for Racial Germans (<span class='it'>mit dem Leiter der
Volksdeutschen Mittelstelle</span>), as well as the German Minister
in Prague, as the local representative of the Foreign Minister.
The task of the German Minister in Prague would be
to support the demands of the Sudeten German Party as
reasonable, not officially, but in more private talks with the
Czechoslovak politicians without exerting any direct influence
on the extent of the demands of the Party.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In conclusion there was a discussion whether it would be
useful if the Sudeten German Party would cooperate with
other minorities in Czechoslovakia, especially with the
Slovaks. The Foreign Minister decided that the Party
should have the discretion to keep a loose contact with other
minority groups if the adoption of a parallel course by them
might appear appropriate.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Not the least interesting aspect of this secret meeting is the
list of those who attended. Konrad Henlein, his principal
deputy, Karl Hermann Frank, and two others represented the
Sudeten German Party. Professor Haushofer and SS Obergruppenfuehrer
<span class='pageno' title='549' id='Page_549'></span>
Lorenz represented the <span class='it'>Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle</span>, the
Central Office for Racial Germans. The Foreign Office was represented
by a delegation of eight. These eight included Ribbentrop,
who presided at the meeting and did most of the talking,
von Mackensen, Weiszacker, and Minister Eisenlohr from the
German Legation at Prague. (<span class='it'>2788-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In May Henlein came to Berlin for more conversations with the
Nazi conspirators. At this time the plans for Case Green, the
attack on Czechoslovakia, were already on paper, and it may be
assumed that Henlein was briefed on the role he was to play during
the summer months. The entry for 22 May 1938 in General
Jodl’s diary reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“22 May: Fundamental conference between the Fuehrer
and K. Henlein” (see enclosure). (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The enclosure, unfortunately, is missing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be recalled that in his speech in Vienna, Henlein had
admitted that he had been selected by the Nazi conspirators in
the fall of 1933 to take over the political leadership of the Sudeten
Germans (<span class='it'>2863-PS</span>). The foregoing documents show conclusively
the nature of Henlein’s mission. They demonstrate that
Henlein’s policy, his propaganda, even his speeches were controlled
by Berlin. Furthermore, from the year 1935 the Sudeten
German Party had been secretly subsidized by the German Foreign
Office. A secret memorandum, captured in the German
Foreign Office files, signed by Woermann and dated Berlin, 19
August 1938, was occasioned by the request of the Henlein Party
for additional funds. This memorandum reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“MEMORANDUM</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Sudeten German Party has been subsidized by the Foreign
Office regularly since 1935 with certain amounts, consisting
of a monthly payment of 15,000 Marks; 12,000 Marks
of this are transmitted to the Prague Legation for disbursement,
and 3000 Marks are paid out to the Berlin representation
of the party (Bureau Buerger). In the course of the
last few months the tasks assigned to the Bureau Buerger
have increased considerably due to the current negotiations
with the Czech Government. The number of pamphlets and
maps which are produced and disseminated has risen; the
propaganda activity in the press has grown immensely; the
expense accounts have increased especially because due to
the necessity for continuous good information, the expenses
for trips to Prague, London, and Paris (including the financing
of travels of Sudeten-German deputies and agents) have
grown considerably heavier. Under these conditions the
<span class='pageno' title='550' id='Page_550'></span>
Bureau Buerger is no longer able to get along with the
monthly allowance of 3000 Marks if it is to do everything
required. Therefore, Mr. Buerger has applied to this office
for an increase of this amount, from 3000 Marks to 5500
Marks monthly. In view of the considerable increase in the
business transacted by the Bureau, and of the importance
which marks the activity of the Bureau in regard to the
cooperation with the Foreign Office, this desire deserves the
strongest support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the military preparations to attack Czechoslovakia moved
forward in the late summer and early fall of 1938, the Nazi command
made good use of Henlein and his followers. About the first
of August the Air Attache at the German Legation in Prague,
Major Moericke, acting on instructions from Luftwaffe headquarters
in Berlin, visited the Sudeten-German leader in Freudenthal.
With his assistance, and in the company of the local
leader of the FS (the Henlein equivalent of the SS), he reconnoitered
the surrounding countryside to select possible airfield
sites for German use. The FS leader, a Czech reservist then on
leave, was in the uniform of the Czech army—a fact which, the
attache noted, served as excellent camouflage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Air Attache’s report reads in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The manufacturer M. is head of the Sudeten-German Glider
Pilots in Freudenthal and said to be absolutely reliable by
my trusted men. My personal impression fully confirmed
this judgment. No hint of my identity was made to him,
although I had the impression that M. knew who I was.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At my request, with which he complied without any question,
M. travelled with me over the country in question. We
used M.’s private car for the trip.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As M. did not know the country around Beneschau sufficiently
well, he took with him the local leader of the FS, a
Czech reservist of the Sudeten German Racial Group, at the
time on leave. He was in uniform. For reasons of camouflage
I was entirely in agreement with this—without actually
saying so.
<span class='pageno' title='551' id='Page_551'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“As M., during the course of the drive, observed that I
photographed large open spaces out of the car, he said ‘Aha,
so you’re looking for airfields!’ I answered that we supposed
that, in the case of any serious trouble, the Czechs would
put their airfields immediately behind the line of fortifications
and that I had the intention of looking over the country
from that point of view.” (<span class='it'>1536-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In the latter part of the Air Attache’s report reference is made
to the presence of reliable agents and informers (<span class='it'>V-Leute</span>)
apparently drawn from the ranks of the Henlein Party in this
area. It was indicated that these agents were in touch with the
<span class='it'>Abwehrstelle</span>, the intelligence office in Breslau. (<span class='it'>1536-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In September, when the propaganda campaign was reaching its
height, the Nazis were not satisfied with playing merely on the
Sudeten demands for autonomy. They attempted to use the Slovaks
as well. On 19 September the Foreign Office in Berlin sent
the following telegram to the German Legation in Prague:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Please inform deputy Kundt, at Konrad Henlein’s request,
to get into touch with the Slovaks at once and induce them
to start their demands for autonomy tomorrow.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>(<span class='it'>2858-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Kundt was Henlein’s representative in Prague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the harassed Czech government sought to stem the disorder
in the Sudetenland, the German Foreign Office turned to threatening
diplomatic tactics in a deliberate effort to increase the
tension between the two countries. Four telegrams from the
Foreign Office in Berlin to the Legation in Prague, dispatched
between the 16th and 24th of September 1938, are self-explanatory.
The first telegram is dated 16 September:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Tonight 150 subjects of Czechoslovakia of Czech blood
were arrested in Germany. This measure is an answer to the
arrest of Sudeten-Germans since the Fuehrer’s speech of 12
September. I request you to ascertain the number of Sudeten-Germans
arrested since 12 September as extensively as possible.
The number of those arrested there is estimated conservatively
at 400 by the Gestapo. Cable report.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The second telegram is dated 17 September. The first two paragraphs
read:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I. Request to inform the local government immediately of
the following:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Government has decided that:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>a</span>) Immediately as many Czech subjects of Czech descent,

<p class='noindent'>The third telegram was sent on 24 September:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to information received here Czechs have arrested
2 German frontier-policemen, seven customs-officials

<p class='pindent'>In the latter half of September Henlein devoted himself and
his followers wholeheartedly to preparation for the coming
German attack. About 15 September, after Hitler’s provocative
Nurnberg speech in which he accused “this Benes” of “torturing”
and planning the “extermination” of the Sudeten-Germans,
Henlein and Karl Hermann Frank, one of his principal
deputies, fled to Germany to avoid arrest by the Czech government.
In Germany Henlein broadcast over the powerful <span class='it'>Reichssender</span>
radio station his determination to lead the Sudeten-Germans
“home to the Reich” and denounced “the Hussite Bolshevik
criminals of Prague”. From his headquarters in a castle at Dondorf,
outside Bayreuth, he kept in close touch with the leading
Nazi conspirators, including Hitler and Himmler. He directed
activities along the border and began the organization of the
Sudeten German Free Corps, an auxiliary military organization.
These events are set forth in the Czechoslovak official report.
(<span class='it'>998-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henlein’s activities were carried on with the advice and assistance
of the Nazi leaders. Lt. Col. Koechling was assigned to Henlein
<span class='pageno' title='553' id='Page_553'></span>
in an advisory capacity to assist with the Sudeten German
Free Corps. In a conference with Hitler on the night of 17 September
Koechling received far-reaching military powers. At this
conference the purpose of the Free Corps was frankly stated:
the “maintenance of disorder and clashes”. <span class='it'>Item 25</span>, of the
Schmundt file (388-PS), a telegram labeled Most Secret reads as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Last night conference took place between Fuehrer and
Oberstleutnant Koechling. Duration of conference 7 minutes.
Lt. Col. Koechling remains directly responsible to
OKW. He will be assigned to Konrad Henlein in an advisory
capacity. He received far-reaching military plenary powers
from the Fuehrer. The Sudeten German Free Corps remains
responsible to Konrad Henlein alone. Purpose: Protection
of the Sudeten-Germans and maintenance of disturbances
and clashes. The Free Corps will be established in Germany.
Armament only with Austrian weapons. Activities of Free
Corps to begin as soon as possible.” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 25</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>General Jodl’s diary gives a further insight into the position
of the Henlein Free Corps. At this time the Free Corps was
engaged in active skirmishing along the Czech border, furnishing
incidents and provocation in the desired manner. Jodl’s entries
for 19 and 20 September 1938 state:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>19 September</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Order is given to the Army High Command to take care of
the Sudeten German Free Corps.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>20 September</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“England and France have handed over their demands in
Prague, the contents of which are still unknown. The activities
of the Free Corps start assuming such an extent that
they may bring about, and already have brought about
consequences harmful to the plans of the Army. (Transferring
rather strong units of the Czech Army to the proximity
of the border.) By checking with Lt. Col. Koechling, I
attempt to lead these activities into normal channels.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Toward the evening the Fuehrer also takes a hand and gives
permission to act only with groups up to 12 men each, after
the approval of the Corps HQ.” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A report from Henlein’s staff, which was filed in Hitler’s
headquarters, boasted of the offensive operations of the Free
Corps in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Since 19 Sept.—in more than 300 missions—the Free
Corps has executed its task with an amazing spirit of <span class='it'>attack</span>
and with a willingness often reaching a degree of unqualified
<span class='pageno' title='554' id='Page_554'></span>
self-sacrifice. The result of the first phase of its activities:
more than 1500 prisoners, 25 MG’s and a large amount of
other weapons and equipment, aside from serious losses in
dead and wounded suffered by the <span class='it'>enemy</span>.” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item
30</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In this document the word “attack” was subsequently crossed
out, and the word “defense” substituted. Similarly “the enemy”
was changed to read “the Czech terrorists”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his headquarters in the castle at Dondorf, Henlein was in
close touch with Admiral Canaris of the Intelligence Division
of the OKW and with the SS and SA. The liaison officer between
the SS and Henlein was Oberfuehrer Gottlob Berger, who in later
years became prominent in the SS command. An affidavit executed
by Berger reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I, GOTTLOB BERGER, under oath and being previously
sworn, make the following statement:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. In the fall of 1938 I held the rank and title of Oberfuehrer
in the SS. In mid-September I was assigned as SS
Liaison Officer with Konrad Henlein’s Sudeten German Free
Corps at their headquarters in the castle of Dondorf outside
Bayreuth. In this position I was responsible for all liaison
between the Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler and Henlein and, in
particular, I was delegated to select from the Sudeten-Germans
those who appeared to be eligible for membership in
the SS or VT (<span class='it'>Verfuegungs Truppe</span>). In addition to myself,
Liaison Officers stationed with Henlein included an Obergruppenfuehrer
from the NSKK, whose name I have forgotten,
and Obergruppenfuehrer Max Juettner, from the SA.
In addition, Admiral Canaris, who was head of the OKW
<span class='it'>Abwehr</span>, appeared at Dondorf nearly every two days and
conferred with Henlein.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. In the course of my official duties at Henlein’s headquarters
I became familiar with the composition and activities
of the Free Corps. Three groups were being formed
under Henlein’s direction: One in the Eisenstein area,
Bavaria; one in the Bayreuth area; one in the Dresden area;
and possibly a fourth group in Silesia. These groups were
supposedly composed of refugees from the Sudetenland who
had crossed the border into Germany, but they actually contained
Germans with previous service in the SA and NSKK
(Nazi Motor Corps) as well. These Germans formed the
skeleton of the Free Corps. On paper the Free Corps had a
strength of 40,000 men. I do not know its actual strength,
but I believe it to be considerably smaller than the paper
<span class='pageno' title='555' id='Page_555'></span>
figure. The Corps was armed with Manlicher-Schoenauer
rifles from Army depots in Austria. It was my understanding
that about 18,000 rifles were issued to men under Henlein’s
command. In addition, small numbers of machine
guns<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>, hand grenades, and 2 captured antitank guns were
placed at Henlein’s disposal. Part of the equipment furnished
to Henlein, mostly haversacks, cooking utensils, and
blankets, were supplied by the SA.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. In the days preceding the conclusion of the four-power
pact at Munich I heard of numerous occasions on which the
Henlein Free Corps was engaged in skirmishes with Czech
patrols along the border of the Sudetenland. These operations
were under the direction of Henlein, who went forward
from his Headquarters repeatedly in order to take direct
command of his men.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The facts stated above are true; this declaration is made by
me voluntarily and without compulsion; after reading over
this statement I have signed and executed the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henlein and his Free Corps were also acting in collaboration
with the SD, (<span class='it'>Sicherheitsdienst</span>) Himmler’s intelligence organization.
An affidavit executed by Alfred Helmut Naujocks, a
member of the SD, reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I, ALFRED HELMUT NAUJOCKS, being first duly sworn,
depose and state as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. In September 1938 I was working in Amt III of the
SD. (The department which was then called Amt III later
became Amt VI). In the course of my work I traveled between
Berlin, Hof and Munich.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. While in Hof, which is on the Czech border, I paid
repeated visits to the SD Service Department, that is, Intelligence
Office, which has been established there. This Service
Department had the task of collecting all political intelligence
emanating from the Czechoslovak border districts and
passing it on to Berlin. Continuous day and night teleprinter
communications had been established from Hof
direct to Amt III of the SD in Berlin. To the best of my
recollection the head of the Hof office was Daufeldt. The
head of Amt III in Berlin at this time was Jost and his
assistant was Filbert.
<span class='pageno' title='556' id='Page_556'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The bulk of the intelligence we collected came from
Henlein Free Corps, which had its headquarters in a castle
at Dondorf, outside Bayreuth; the distance between Hof and
Bayreuth is not very great, and we had daily access to all
intelligence received by the Free Corps. There was a continuous
liaison maintained with Czech territory by runners.
Exploitation of this Intelligence was carried out every day
in Berlin and was placed before Heydrich and Himmler.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. I remember that the Free Corps made continuous complaints
that they had not received sufficient supply of arms.
Negotiations by letter and teleprint message went on for a
number of days with Berlin until it became quite a nuisance.
After that arms were supplied from the army, but I believe
it was only a small quantity.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. Hof was the center for all intelligence collected by the
SD on the Czechoslovak question. The SD had agents all
along the border in every town. The names of these agents
were reported to Hof, and two motor cars toured the border
every day to collect the intelligence which had been unearthed.
In addition, I remember that two or three companies
of the SS-Totenkopf units were stationed in the neighborhood
of Asch.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The facts stated above are true: this declaration is made
by me voluntarily and without compulsion; after reading
over this statement I have signed and executed the same at
Nurnberg, Germany this 20th day of November 1945.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Offensive operations along the Czechoslovak border were not
confined to skirmishes carried out by the Free Corps. Two SS
<span class='it'>Totenkopf</span> battalions were operating across the border in Czech
territory near Asch. <span class='it'>Item 36</span> in the Schmundt file (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>), an
OKW most secret order signed by Jodl and dated 28 September,
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Those SS-Totenkopf units now operating in the Asch Promontory
(I and II Bn of Oberbayern Regiment) will come
under the C in C Army only when they return to German
Reich territory, or when the Army crosses the German-Czech
frontier.” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 36</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>According to the 25 September entry in General Jodl’s diary
these SS Totenkopf battalions were operating in this area on direct
orders from Hitler. (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the time for X-day approached, the disposition of the Free
Corps became a matter of dispute. On 26 September Himmler
<span class='pageno' title='557' id='Page_557'></span>
issued an order to the Chief of Staff of the Sudeten German Free
Corps directing that the Free Corps come under control of the
Reichsfuehrer SS in the event of German invasion of Czechoslovakia
(<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 37</span>). On 28 September Keitel directed that
as soon as the German Army crosses the Czech border the Free
Corps will take orders from the OKH. In this most secret order
of the OKW Keitel discloses that Henlein’s men are already operating
in Czechoslovak territory:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the Henlein Free Corps and units subordinate to this
the principle remains valid, that they receive instructions
direct from the Fuehrer and that they carry out their operations
only in conjunction with the competent general staff
corps. The advance units of the Free Corps will have to report
to the local commander of the frontier guard immediately
before crossing the frontier.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Those units remaining forward of the frontier should—in
their own interests—get into communication with the frontier
guard as often as possible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As soon as the army crosses the Czech border the Henlein
Free Corps will be subordinate to the OKH. Thus it will be
expedient to assign a sector to the Free Corps even now
which can be fitted into the scheme of army boundaries
later.” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 34</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 September, when it became clear that the Munich settlement
would result in a peaceful occupation of the Sudetenland,
Keitel ordered that the Free Corps Henlein in its present composition
be placed under command of Himmler:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. <span class='it'>Attachment of Henlein Free Corps</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces has just ordered
that the Henlein Free Corps in its present composition
be placed under command of Reichsfuehrer-SS and Chief of
German Police.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is therefore at the immediate disposal of OKH as field
unit for the invasion, but is to be later drawn in like the rest
of the police forces for police duties in agreement with the
Reichsfuehrer SS.” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 38</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>J. <span class='it'>Occupation of the Sudetenland under the Terms of the Munich
Agreement.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the threat of war by the Nazi conspirators, and with war
in fact about to be launched, the United Kingdom and France concluded
a pact with Germany and Italy at Munich on the night of
29 September 1938. This treaty provided for the cession of the
<span class='pageno' title='558' id='Page_558'></span>
Sudetenland by Czechoslovakia to Germany. Czechoslovakia was
required to acquiesce. (<span class='it'>TC-23</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 1 October 1938 German troops began the occupation of the
Sudetenland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the conclusion of the Munich Pact the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> had
been fully deployed for attack, awaiting only the word of Hitler
to begin the assault. With the cession of the Sudetenland new
orders were issued. On 30 September Keitel promulgated Directive
#1 on “Occupation of territory separated from Czechoslovakia”
(<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 39</span>). This directive contained a timetable
for the occupation of sectors of former Czech territory between
1 and 10 October and specified the tasks of the German armed
forces. The fourth and fifth paragraphs provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The Armed Forces will have the following tasks:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The present degree of mobilized preparedness is to be
maintained completely, for the present also in the West.
Order for the rescinding of measures taken is held over.
“The entry is to be planned in such a way that it can easily
be converted into operation ‘<span class='it'>Gruen</span>’.” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 39</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It contained one further provision about the Henlein forces:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Henlein Free Corps. All combat action on the part of the
Volunteer Corps must cease as from 1st October.” (<span class='it'>388-PS,
Item 39</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Schmundt file contains a number of additional secret OKW
directives giving instructions for the occupation of the Sudetenland
and showing the scope of the preparations of the OKW.
Directives specifying the occupational area of the army and the
units under its command; arranging for communications facilities,
exchange facilities, supply, and propaganda; and giving instructions
to the civil departments of the government were issued
over Keitel’s signature on 30 September (<span class='it'>388-PS, Items
40, 41, 42</span>). By 10 October von Brauchitsch was able to report
to Hitler that German troops had reached the demarcation line
and that the order for the occupation of the Sudetenland had been
fulfilled. The OKW requested Hitler’s permission to rescind
Case Green, to withdraw troops from the occupied area and to
relieve the OKH of executive powers in the Sudeten-German
area as of 15 October. (<span class='it'>388-PS, Items 46, 47, 49</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 18 October, in a formal letter to the Commander-in-Chief of
the Army, Col. Gen. von Brauchitsch, Hitler announced that the
civil authorities would take over responsibility for the Sudeten-German
territory on 21 October and that the OKH would be relieved
of executive powers as of that date (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 51</span>).
On the same date additional demobilization of the forces in the
<span class='pageno' title='559' id='Page_559'></span>
Sudetenland was ordered by Hitler and Keitel. Three days later
the OKW requested Hitler’s consent to the reversion of the RAD
from the control of the armed forces. (<span class='it'>388-PS, Items 52, 53</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the German forces entered the Sudetenland Henlein’s <span class='it'>Sudetendeutsche
Partei</span> was merged with the NSDAP of Hitler. The
two men who had fled to Hitler’s protection in mid-September,
Henlein and Karl Hermann Frank, were appointed Gauleiter and
Deputy Gauleiter, respectively, of the <span class='it'>Sudetengau</span>. In the parts
of the Czechoslovak Republic that were still free the <span class='it'>Sudetendeutsche
Partei</span> constituted itself as the <span class='it'>National-Sozialistische
Deutsche Arbeiter-Partei in der Tschechoslovakei</span> (NSDAP in
Czechoslovakia) under the direction of Kundt, another of Henlein’s
deputies. These events are set forth in the Czechoslovak
official report. (<span class='it'>998-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stage was now prepared for the next move of the Nazi
conspirators.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>K. <span class='it'>Planning for the Conquest of the Remainder of Czechoslovakia.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>With the occupation of the Sudetenland and the inclusion of the
German-speaking Czechs within the Greater Reich it might have
been expected that the Nazi conspirators would be satisfied. Thus
far in the Nazi program of aggression the conspirators had used
as a pretext for their conquests the union of the <span class='it'>Volksdeutsche</span>,
the people of German descent, with the Reich. Now, after Munich,
substantially all the <span class='it'>Volksdeutsche</span> in Czechoslovakia had
been returned to German rule. On 26 September, at the Sportspalast
in Berlin, Hitler spoke these words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“And now we are confronted with the last problem which
must be solved and which will be solved. It is the last territorial
claim which I have to make in Europe, but it is a claim
from which I will not swerve, and which I will satisfy, God
willing.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I have little to explain. I am grateful to Mr. Chamberlain
for all his efforts, and I have assured him that the German
people want nothing but peace; but I have also told him that
I cannot go back beyond the limits of our patience.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I assured him, moreover, and I repeat it here, that when
this problem is solved there will be no more territorial problems
for Germany in Europe. And I further assured him
that from the moment when Czechoslovakia solves its other
problems, that is to say when the Czechs have come to an arrangement
with their other minorities peacefully and without
<span class='pageno' title='560' id='Page_560'></span>
oppression, I will no longer be interested in the Czech
State. And that as far as I am concerned I will guarantee.
We don’t want any Czechs at all.” (<span class='it'>2358-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Yet no more than two weeks later Hitler and Keitel were preparing
estimates of the military forces required to break Czechoslovak
resistance in Bohemia and Moravia. <span class='it'>Item 48</span> of the
Schmundt file is a top secret telegram sent by Keitel to Hitler’s
headquarters on 11 October 1938 in answer to four questions
which Hitler had propounded to the OKW. These were the
questions:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Question 1: What reinforcements are necessary in the present
situation to break all Czech resistance in Bohemia and
Moravia?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Question 2: How much time is required for the regrouping
or moving up of new forces?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Question 3: How much time will be required for the same
purpose if it is executed after the intended demobilization
and return measures?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Question 4: How much time would be required to achieve
the state of readiness of October 1st?” (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 48</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Whereupon, in the same telegram, Keitel reported to Hitler the
considered answers of the OKH and the Luftwaffe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 21 October, the same day on which the administration of
the Sudetenland was handed over to the civilian authorities, a directive
outlining plans for the conquest of the remainder of Czechoslovakia
was signed by Hitler and initialed by Keitel. In this
Top Secret Order, of which 10 copies were made, the Nazi conspirators,
only three weeks after the winning of the Sudetenland,
were already looking forward to new conquests:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The future tasks for the Armed Forces and the preparations
for the conduct of war resulting from these tasks will be laid
down by me in a later Directive.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Until this Directive comes into force the Armed Forces must
be prepared at all times for the following eventualities:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The securing of the frontiers of Germany and the protection
against surprise air attacks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The liquidation of the remainder of Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The occupation of the Memelland.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It must be possible to smash at any time the remainder of
Czechoslovakia if her policy should become hostile towards
Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The preparations to be made by the Armed Forces for this
contingency will be considerably smaller in extent than those
<span class='pageno' title='561' id='Page_561'></span>
for ‘<span class='it'>Gruen</span>’; they must, however, guarantee a continuous and
considerably higher state of preparedness, since planned mobilization
measures have been dispensed with. The organization,
order of battle and state of readiness of the units earmarked
for that purpose are in peace-time to be so arranged
for a surprise assault that Czechoslovakia herself will be deprived
of all possibility of organized resistance. The object
is the swift occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and the cutting
off of Slovakia. The preparations should be such, that at
the same time ‘<span class='it'>Grenzsicherung West</span>’ (the measures of frontier
defense in the West) can be carried out.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The detailed mission of Army and Air Force is as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a. Army</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The units stationed in the vicinity of Bohemia-Moravia and
several motorized divisions are to be earmarked for a surprise
type of attack. Their number will be determined by
the forces remaining in Czechoslovakia; a quick and decisive
success must be assured. The assembly and preparations
for the attack must be worked out. Forces not needed will
be kept in readiness in such a manner that they may be either
committed in securing the frontiers or sent after the attack
army.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b. Air Force</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The quick advance of the German Army is to be assured by
an early elimination of the Czech Air Force.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For this purpose the commitment in a surprise attack from
peace-time bases has to be prepared. Whether for this purpose
still stronger forces may be required can only be determined
from the development of the military situation in
Czechoslovakia. At the same time a simultaneous assembly
of the remainder of the offensive forces against the West
must be prepared.” (<span class='it'>C-136</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This order was signed by Hitler and authenticated by Keitel. It
was distributed to the OKH, to Goering’s Luftwaffe, and to Raeder
at Navy headquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two months later, on 17 December 1938, Keitel issued an appendix
to the original order stating that by command of the
Fuehrer preparations for the liquidation of Czechoslovakia are to
continue. Distribution of this Top Secret order was the same as
for the 21 October order. The order provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“2. <span class='it'>COROLLARY TO DIRECTIVE OF 21.10.38.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Reference ‘Liquidation of the Rest of Czechoslovakia’ the
Fuehrer has given the following additional order:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The preparations for this eventuality are to continue on the
<span class='pageno' title='562' id='Page_562'></span>
assumption that no resistance worth mentioning is to be
expected.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“To the outside world too it must clearly appear that it is
merely an action of pacification and not a warlike undertaking.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The action must therefore be carried out by the peace time
Armed Forces <span class='it'>only</span>, without reinforcements from mobilization.
The necessary readiness for action, especially the ensuring
that the most necessary supplies are brought up,
must be effected by adjustment within the units.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Similarly the units of the Army detailed for the march
must, as a general rule, leave their stations only during the
night prior to the crossing of the frontier, and will not previously
form up systematically on the frontier. The transport
necessary for previous organization should be limited
to the minimum and will be camouflaged as much as possible.
Necessary movements, if any, of single units and particularly
of motorized forces, to the troop-training areas situated near
the frontier, must have the approval of the Fuehrer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Air Force should take action in accordance with the
similar general directives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> moved forward with plans for what it
clearly considered would be an easy victory, the Foreign Office
played its part. In a discussion of means of improving German-Czech
relations with the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister, Chvalkovsky,
in Berlin on 21 January 1939, Ribbentrop urged upon the
Czech government a “quick reduction” in the size of the Czech
army. The captured German Foreign Office notes of this discussion
bear the following footnote, in Ribbentrop’s handwriting:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I mentioned to Chvalkovsky especially that a quick reduction
in the Czech army would be decisive in our judgment.”

<p class='pindent'>L. <span class='it'>Extension of Fifth Column Activity</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As in the case of Austria and the Sudetenland, the Nazi conspirators
did not intend to rely on the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> alone to accomplish
their calculated objective of “liquidating” Czechoslovakia.
With the German minority separated from Czechoslovakia,
they could no longer use the cry, “home to the Reich.”
One sizeable minority, the Slovaks, remained within the Czechoslovak
State. The Czechoslovak Government had made every effort
to conciliate Slovak extremists in the months after the cession
of the Sudetenland. Autonomy had been granted to Slovakia,
with an autonomous cabinet and parliament at Bratislava. Nonetheless,
despite these concessions, it was in Slovakia that the Nazi
conspirators found men ready to take their money and do their
bidding. The following picture of Nazi operations in Slovakia is
based on the Czechoslovak official report. (<span class='it'>998-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nazi propaganda and “research” groups had long been interested
in maintaining close connections with the Slovak autonomist
opposition. When Bela Tuka, who later became Prime Minister
of the puppet state of Slovakia, was tried for espionage
and treason in 1929, the evidence established that he had already
established connections with Nazi groups within Germany. Prior
to 1938 Nazi aides were in close contact with Slovak traitors living
in exile and were attempting to establish more profitable contacts
in the semi-fascist Slovak Catholic Peoples Party of Monsignor
Andrew Hlinka. Out of sympathy with the predominantly
anti-clerical government in Prague, some Catholic elements in
Slovakia proved willing to cooperate with the Nazis. In February
and July 1938 the leaders of the Henlein movement conferred
with top men of Father Hlinka’s party and agreed to furnish
one another with mutual assistance in pressing their respective
claims to autonomy. This understanding proved useful in the
September agitation when, at the proper moment, the Foreign
Office in Berlin wired the Henlein leader, Kundt, in Prague to
tell the Slovaks to start their demands for autonomy. (See
<span class='it'>2858-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time, mid-summer 1938, the Nazis were in direct contact
with figures in the Slovak autonomist movement and had
paid agents among the higher staff of Father Hlinka’s party.
These agents undertook to render impossible any understanding
between the Slovak autonomists and the Slovak parties in the
government at Prague. Franz Karmasin, later to become <span class='it'>Volksgruppenfuehrer</span>,
had been appointed Nazi leader in Slovakia and
professed to be serving the cause of Slovak autonomy while on
the Nazi pay roll. On 22 November the Nazis indiscreetly wired
<span class='pageno' title='564' id='Page_564'></span>
Karmasin to collect his money at the German Legation in person.
The telegram, sent from the German Legation at Prague to Bratislava
(Pressburg), reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Delegate Kundt asks to notify State Secretary Karmasin
that he would appreciate it if he could personally draw the
sum which is being kept for him at the treasury of the embassy.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“HENCKE”&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>2859-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Karmasin proved to be extremely useful to the Nazi cause. A
captured memorandum of the German Foreign Office, dated Berlin,
29 November 1939—eight months after the conquest of
Czechoslovakia—throws a revealing light both on Karmasin and
on the German Foreign Office:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>On the question of payments to KARMASIN</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Karmasin receives 30,000 Marks for the VDA (Peoples’
League for Germans Abroad) until 1 April 1940; from then
on 15,000 Marks monthly.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Furthermore, the Central Office for Racial Germans (<span class='it'>Volksdeutsche
Mittelstelle</span>) has deposited 300,000 Marks for Karmasin
with the German Mission in Bratislava (Pressburg)
on which he could fall back in an emergency.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Furthermore, Karmasin has received money from Reich
Minister Seyss-Inquart; for the present it has been impossible
to determine what amounts had been involved, and
whether the payments will continue.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore it appears that Karmasin has been provided with
sufficient money; thus one could await whether he would put
up new demands himself.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Herewith presented to the Reich Foreign Minister.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“/s/&nbsp;&nbsp;WOERMANN”&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>2794-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This document shows the complicity of the German Foreign Office
in the subsidization of illegal organizations abroad. More important,
it shows that the Germans still considered it necessary
to supply their under-cover representatives in Pressburg with
substantial funds even after the declaration of the so-called independent
State of Slovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some time in the winter of 1938-1939 Goering conferred with
Durcansky and Mach, two leaders in the Slovak extremist group,
who were accompanied by Karmasin. The Slovaks told Goering
of their desire for what they called “independence,” with strong
political, economic, and military ties to Germany. They promised
that the Jewish problem would be solved as it had been in Germany
and that the Communist Party would be prohibited. The
notes of the meeting report that Goering considered that the
<span class='pageno' title='565' id='Page_565'></span>
Slovak efforts towards independence were to be supported, although
his motives were scarcely altruistic. The undated minutes
of this conversation between Goering and Durcansky, captured
among the files of the German Foreign Office, are jotted down in
somewhat telegraphic style:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“To begin with DURKANSKY (Deputy Prime Minister)
reads out declaration. Contents: Friendship for the Fuehrer;
gratitude, that through the Fuehrer autonomy has become
possible for the SLOVAKS. The SLOVAKS <span class='it'>never</span> want to
belong to HUNGARY. The SLOVAKS want <span class='it'>full independence</span>
with strongest political, economic and military ties to
Germany. BRATISLAVA to be capital. The execution of
the plan only possible if the army and police are SLOVAK.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“An independent SLOVAKIA to be proclaimed at the meeting
of the first SLOVAK Diet. In the case of a plebiscite
the majority would favour a separation from PRAGUE. Jews
will vote for Hungary. The area of the plebiscite to be up
to the MARCH, where a large SLOVAK population lives.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The <span class='it'>Jewish problem</span> will be solved similarly to that in Germany.
The Communist party to be prohibited.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The <span class='it'>Germans</span> in SLOVAKIA do not want to belong to
Hungary but wish to stay in SLOVAKIA.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The <span class='it'>German influence</span> with the SLOVAK Government considerable;
the appointment of a German Minister (member
of the cabinet) has been promised.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At present negotiations with HUNGARY are being conducted
by the SLOVAKS. The CZECHS are more yielding
towards the Hungarians than the SLOVAKS.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fieldmarshall considers; that the SLOVAK negotiations
towards independence are to be supported in a suitable
manner. Czechoslovakia without Slovakia is still more at
our mercy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Air bases in Slovakia are of great importance for the German
Air Force for use against the East.” (<span class='it'>2801-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In mid-February 1939 a Slovak delegation journeyed to Berlin.
It consisted of Tuca, one of the Slovaks with whom the Germans
had been in contact, and Karmasin, the paid representative
of the Nazi conspirators in Slovakia. They conferred with Hitler
and Ribbentrop in the Reichs Chancellery in Berlin on Sunday,
12 February 1939. The captured German Foreign Office minutes
of that meeting read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“After a brief welcome Tuca thanks the Fuehrer for granting
this meeting. He addresses the Fuehrer with ‘My Fuehrer’
and he voices the opinion that he, though only a modest
<span class='pageno' title='566' id='Page_566'></span>
man himself, might well claim to speak for the Slovak nation.
The Czech courts and prison gave him the right to
make such a statement. He states that the Fuehrer had not
only opened the Slovak question but that he had been also
the first one to acknowledge the dignity of the Slovak nation.
The Slovakian people will gladly fight under the leadership
of the Fuehrer for the maintenance of European civilization.
Obviously future association with the Czechs had
become an impossibility for the Slovaks from a moral as well
as economic point of view.” (<span class='it'>2790-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It is noteworthy that Tuca addressed Hitler as “My Fuehrer”.
During this meeting the Nazi conspirators apparently were successful
in planting the idea of insurrection with the Slovak delegation.
The final sentence of this document, spoken by Tuca, is
conclusive:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I entrust the fate of my people to your care.” (<span class='it'>2790-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is apparent from these documents that in mid-February 1939
the Nazis had a well-disciplined group of Slovaks at their service,
many of them drawn from the ranks of Father Hlinka’s
party. Flattered by the personal attention of such men as Hitler
and Ribbentrop, and subsidized by German representatives, these
Slovaks proved willing tools in the hands of the Nazi conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the Slovaks, the Nazi conspirators made use of
the few Germans still remaining within the mutilated Czech republic.
Kundt, Henlein’s deputy who had been appointed leader
of this German minority, created as many artificial “focal points
of German culture” as possible. Germans from the districts
handed over to Germany were ordered from Berlin to continue
their studies at the German University in Prague and to make
it a center of aggressive Naziism. With the assistance of German
civil servants, a deliberate campaign of Nazi infiltration into
Czech public and private institutions was carried out, and the
Henleinists gave full cooperation with Gestapo agents from the
Reich who appeared on Czech soil. The Nazi “political activity”
was designed to undermine and to weaken Czech resistance to
the commands from Germany. In the face of continued threats
and duress on both diplomatic and propaganda levels, the Czech
government was unable to take adequate measures against these
trespasses on its sovereignty. (<span class='it'>998-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In early March, with the date for the invasion of Czechoslovakia
already close at hand, fifth column activity moved into
its final phase. In Bohemia and Moravia the FS, Henlein’s equivalent
of the SS, were in touch with the Nazi conspirators in the
Reich and laid the groundwork for the events of 14 and 15 March.
<span class='pageno' title='567' id='Page_567'></span>
An article by SS-Gruppenfuehrer Karl Hermann Frank, published
in <span class='it'>Boehmen und Maehren</span>, the official periodical of the
Reichs Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, March 1941, page 79,
reveals with considerable frankness the functions which the FS
and SS served and the pride the Nazi conspirators took in the
activities of these organizations:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“The SS on March 15, 1939</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A modern people and a modern state are today unthinkable
without political troops. To these are allotted the special
task of being the advance guard of the political will and the
guarantor of its unity. This is especially true of the German
folk-groups, which have their home in some other people’s
state. Accordingly the Sudeten German Party had formerly
also organized its political troop, the Voluntary Vigilantes
(<span class='it'>Freiwilliger Selbstschutz</span>), called ‘FS’ for short. This
troop was trained essentially in accordance with the principles
of the SS, so far as these could be used in this region
at that time. The troop was likewise assigned here the special
task of protecting the homeland, actively, if necessary.
It stood up well in its first test in this connection, wherever
in the fall crisis of 1938 it had to assume the protection of
the homeland, arms in hand.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“After the annexation of the Sudeten Gau, the tasks of the
FS were transferred essentially to the German student organizations
as compact troop formations in Prague and
Brunn, aside from the isolated German communities which
remained in the second republic. This was also natural because
many active students from the Sudeten Gau were already
members of the FS. The student organizations then
had to endure this test, in common with other Germans, during
the crisis of March 1939 * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the early morning hours of March 15, after the announcement
of the planned entry of German troops in various localities,
German men had to act in some localities in order to
assure a quiet course of events, either by assumption of the
police authority, as for instance in Brunn, or by corresponding
instruction of the police president, etc. In some Czech
offices, men had likewise, in the early hours of the morning,
begun to burn valuable archives and the material of political
files. It was also necessary to take measures here in order
to prevent foolish destruction * * *. How significant the
many-sided and comprehensive measures were considered by
the competent German agencies, follows from the fact that
<span class='pageno' title='568' id='Page_568'></span>
many of the men either on March 15 itself or on the following
days were admitted into the SS with fitting acknowledgment,
in part even through the Reichsfuehrer SS himself
or through SS Group Leader Heydrich. The activities
and deeds of these men were thereby designated as accomplished
in the interest of the SS.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Immediately after the corresponding divisions of the SS had
marched in with the first columns of the German Army and
had assumed responsibility in the appropriate sectors, the
men here placed themselves at once at their further disposition
and became valuable auxiliaries and collaborators.

<p class='pindent'>In Slovakia the long-anticipated crisis came on 10 March. On
that day the Czechoslovakian government dismissed those members
of the Slovak Cabinet who refused to continue negotiations
with Prague, among them Prime Minister Tiso and Durcansky.
Within 24 hours the Nazis seized upon this act of the Czech government
as an excuse for intervention. On the following day,
11 March, a strange scene was enacted in Bratislava, the Slovak
capital. It is related in the report of the British Minister in
Prague to the British government:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Herr Buerckel, Herr Seyss-Inquart and five German generals
came at about 10 P. M. on the evening of Saturday, the
11th March, into a Cabinet meeting in progress at Bratislava,
and told the Slovak Government that they should proclaim
the independence of Slovakia. When M. Sidor (the
Prime Minister) showed hesitation, Herr Buerckel took him
on one side and explained that Herr Hitler had decided to
settle the question of Czecho-Slovakia definitely. Slovakia
ought, therefore, to proclaim her independence because Herr
Hitler would otherwise disinterest himself in her fate. M.
Sidor thanked Herr Buerckel for this information, but said
that he must discuss the situation with the Government at
Prague.” (<span class='it'>D-571</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Events were now moving rapidly. Durcansky, one of the dismissed
ministers, escaped with Nazi assistance to Vienna, where
the facilities of the German broadcasting station were placed at
his disposal. Arms and ammunition were brought from German
<span class='pageno' title='569' id='Page_569'></span>
Offices in Engerau, across the Danube, into Slovakia where they
were used by the FS and the Hlinka Guard to create incidents
and disorder of the type required by the Nazis as an excuse for
military action. The situation at Engerau is described in an
affidavit of Alfred Helmut Naujocks:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I, ALFRED HELMUT NAUJOCKS, being first duly sworn,
depose and state as follows—</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. From 1934 to 1941 I was a member of the SD. In the
winter of 1939 I was stationed in Berlin, working in Amt VI,
Chief Sector South East. Early in March, four or five days
before Slovakia declared its independence, Heydrich, who
was chief of the SD, ordered me to report to Nebe, the chief
of the Reich Criminal Police. Nebe had been told by Heydrich
to accelerate the production of explosives which his
department was manufacturing for the use of certain Slovak
groups. These explosives were small tins weighing approximately
500 grams.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. As soon as forty or fifty of these explosives had been
finished, I carried them by automobile to a small village
called Engerau, just across the border from Pressburg in
Slovakia. The Security Police had a Service Department in
this village for the handling of SD activities. I turned over
the explosives to this office and found there a group of Slovaks,
including Karmasin, Mach, Tuka and Durcansky. In
fact, three of these people then present later became ministers
in the new Slovak government. I was informed that the
explosives were to be turned over to the Hlinka Guards
across the border in Slovakia and were to be used in incidents
designed to create the proper atmosphere for a revolution.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. I stayed in Engerau for a day and a half and then returned
to Berlin.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. One or two weeks later I met in Berlin the same Slovak
delegation, including Mach, Tuka, Durcansky and Karmasin,
which I had seen in Engerau. They had flown to Berlin for
a conference with Goering. Heydrich asked me to look after
them and to report to him what developed during the conference
with Goering. I reported this conference in detail to
Heydrich. It dealt principally with the organization of the
new Slovak state. My principal recollection of the conference
is that the Slovaks hardly got a word in because Goering
was talking all the time.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The facts stated above are true; this declaration is made by
<span class='pageno' title='570' id='Page_570'></span>
me voluntarily and without compulsion; after reading over
the statement I have signed and executed the same at NURNBERG,
Germany this 20th day of November 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this time the German press and radio launched a violent
campaign against the Czechoslovak government. And, significantly,
an invitation from Berlin was delivered in Bratislava.
Tiso, the dismissed prime minister, was summoned by Hitler to
an audience in the German capital. A plane was awaiting him
in Vienna. (<span class='it'>998-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3061-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2943-PS</span>)</p>

Force.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point, in the second week of March 1939, preparations
for what the Nazi leaders liked to call the “liquidation” of Czechoslovakia
were progressing with a gratifying smoothness. The
military, diplomatic, and propaganda machinery of the Nazi conspirators
was moving in close coordination. As during Case
Green of the preceding summer, the Nazi conspirators had invited
Hungary to participate in the attack. It appears from a
letter Admiral Horthy, the Hungarian Regent, wrote to Hitler
on 13 March 1939, which was captured in the German Foreign
Office files, that Horthy was flattered by the invitation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Your Excellency,</p>

<p class='noindent'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My sincere thanks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I can hardly tell you how happy I am because this Head
Water Region—I dislike using big words—is of vital importance
to the life of Hungary.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In spite of the fact that our recruits have only been serving
for 5 weeks we are going into this affair with eager enthusiasm.
The dispositions have already been made. On
Thursday, the 16th of this month, a frontier incident will
take place which will be followed by the big blow on Saturday.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I shall never forget this proof of friendship and your Excellency
may rely on my unshakeable gratitude at all times.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“Your devoted friend.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;'>“(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;HORTHY”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Budapest. 13.3.1939.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>2816-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From this letter it may be inferred that the Nazi conspirators
had already informed the Hungarian government of their plans
<span class='pageno' title='571' id='Page_571'></span>
for military action against Czechoslovakia. As it turned out,
the timetable was advanced somewhat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the diplomatic level Ribbentrop was active. On 13 March,
the same day on which Horthy wrote his letter, Ribbentrop sent
a cautionary telegram to the German minister in Prague, outlining
the course of conduct he should pursue during the coming
diplomatic pressure:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='it'>Telegram in secret code</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“With reference to telephone instructions given by Kordt

<p class='noindent'>“In case you should get any written communication from
President HACHA, please do not make any written or verbal
comments or take any other action on them but pass them
on here by cipher telegram. Moreover, I must ask you and
the other members of the Embassy to make a point of not
being available if the Czech government wants to communicate
with you during the next few days.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;RIBBENTROP”.&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>2815-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the afternoon of 13 March, Monsignor Tiso, accompanied
by Durcansky and by Karmasin, the local Nazi leader, arrived
in Berlin in response to the summons from Hitler. Late that
afternoon Tiso was received by Hitler in his study in the Reichs
Chancellery and was presented with an ultimatum. Two alternatives
were given him: either to declare the independence of Slovakia
or to be left, without German assistance, to the mercies of
Poland and Hungary. This decision, Hitler said, was not a question
of days, but of hours. The captured German Foreign Office
minutes of this meeting between Hitler and Tiso on 13 March
show that in the inducements Hitler held out to the Slovaks Hitler
displayed his customary disregard for truth:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Now he [Hitler] had permitted Minister Tiso to
come here in order to make this question clear in a very
short time. Germany had no interests east of the Carpathian
mountains. It was indifferent to him what happened there.
The question was whether Slovakia wished to conduct her
own affairs or not. He did not wish for anything from Slovakia.
He would not pledge his people or even a single soldier
to something which was not in any way desired by the
Slovak people. He would like to secure final confirmation as
to what Slovakia really wished. He did not wish that reproaches
should come from Hungary that he was preserving
something which did not wish to be preserved at all. He
took a liberal view of unrest and demonstration in general,
but in this connection, unrest was only an outward indication
<span class='pageno' title='572' id='Page_572'></span>
of interior instability. He would not tolerate it, and
he had for that reason permitted Tiso to come in order to
hear his decision. It was not a question of days, but of
hours. He had stated at that time that if Slovakia wished to
make herself independent he would support this endeavor
and even guarantee it. He would stand by his word so long
as Slovakia would make it clear that she wished for independence.
If she hesitated or did not wish to dissolve the
connection with Prague, he would leave the destiny of Slovakia
to the mercy of events, for which he was no longer responsible.
In that case he would only intercede for German
interests and those did not lie east of the Carpathians. Germany
had nothing to do with Slovakia. She had never belonged
to Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer asked the Reich Foreign Minister if he had
any remarks to add. The Reich Foreign Minister also emphasized
for his part the conception that in this case a decision
was a question of hours not of days. He showed the
Fuehrer a message he had just received which reported Hungarian
troop movements on the Slovak frontiers. The Fuehrer
read this report, mentioned it to Tiso, and expressed the
hope that Slovakia would soon decide clearly for herself.”
(<span class='it'>2802-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Those present at this meeting included Ribbentrop, Keitel, State
Secretary Dietrich, State Secretary Keppler, and Minister of
State Meissner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While in Berlin, the Slovaks also conferred separately with
Ribbentrop and with other high Nazi officials. Ribbentrop solicitously
handed Tiso a copy, already drafted in Slovak, of the law
proclaiming the independence of Slovakia. On the night of 13
March a German plane was placed at Tiso’s disposal to carry him
home. On 14 March, pursuant to the wishes of the Nazi conspirators,
the Diet of Bratislava proclaimed the independence of
Slovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Slovak extremists, acting at Nazi bidding, in open revolt
against the Czechoslovak government, the Nazi leaders were now
in a position to move against Prague. On the evening of 14
March, at the suggestion of the German Legation in Prague M.
Hacha, the president of the Czechoslovak republic, and M. Chvalkovsky,
his foreign minister, arrived in Berlin. The atmosphere
in which they found themselves was hostile. Since the preceding
weekend the Nazi press had accused the Czechs of using violence
against the Slovaks and especially against members of the German
minority and citizens of the Reich. Both press and radio
<span class='pageno' title='573' id='Page_573'></span>
proclaimed that the lives of Germans were in danger, that the
situation was intolerable and that it was necessary to smother
as quickly as possible the focus of trouble which Prague had become
in the heart of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After midnight on the 15 March, at 1:15 in the morning, Hacha
and Chvalkovsky were ushered into the Reichs Chancellery. They
found there Hitler, von Ribbentrop, Goering, Keitel, and other
high Nazi officials. The captured German Foreign Office account
of this meeting furnishes a revealing picture of Nazi behaviour
and tactics. It must be remembered that this account of the conference
of the night of March 14-15 comes from German sources,
and must be read as an account biased by its source.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hacha opened the conference. He was conciliatory, even
humble. He thanked Hitler for receiving him and said he knew
that the fate of Czechoslovakia rested in the Fuehrer’s hands.
Hitler replied that he regretted that he had been forced to ask
Hacha to come to Berlin, particularly because of the great age of
the President. (Hacha was then in his seventies.) But this
journey, Hitler told the President, could be of great advantage
to his country, because “it was only a matter of hours until Germany
would intervene.” The conference proceeded as follows,
with Hitler speaking:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Slovakia was a matter of indifference to him. If Slovakia
had kept closer to Germany, it would have been an obligation
to Germany, but he was glad that he did not have this obligation
now. He had no interests whatsoever in the territory
east of the Lower Carpathian Mts. Last autumn he had
not wanted to draw the final consequences because he had
believed that it was possible to live together. But even at
that time, and also later in his conversations with Chvalkovsky,
he made it clear that he would ruthlessly smash this
state if Benes’ tendencies were not completely revised.
Chvalkovsky understood this and asked the Fuehrer to have
patience. The Fuehrer saw this point of view, but the months
went by without any change. The new regime did not succeed
in eliminating the old one psychologically. He observed
this from the press, mouth to mouth propaganda, dismissals
of Germans and many other things, which, to him, were a
symbol of the whole situation. At first he had not understood
this but when it became clear to him he drew his conclusions
because, had the development continued in this way, the relations
with Czechoslovakia would in a few years have become
the same as six months ago. Why did Czechoslovakia
not immediately reduce its army to a reasonable size? Such
<span class='pageno' title='574' id='Page_574'></span>
an army was a tremendous burden for such a state because
it only makes sense if it supports the foreign political mission
of the State. Since Czechoslovakia no longer has a
foreign political mission, such an army is meaningless. He
enumerates several examples which proved to him that the
spirit in the army had not changed. This symptom convinced
him that the army would be a severe political burden in the
future. Added to this were the inevitable development of
economic necessities and, further, the protests from national
groups which could no longer endure life as it was.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Last Sunday, therefore, for me the die was cast. I summoned
the Hungarian envoy and notified him that I was
withdrawing my [restraining] hands from that country. We
were now confronted with this fact. He had given the order
to the German troops to march into Czechoslovakia and to
incorporate Czechoslovakia into the German Reich. He
wanted to give Czechoslovakia fullest autonomy and a life of
her own to a larger extent than she ever had enjoyed during
Austrian rule. Germany’s attitude towards Czechoslovakia
will be determined tomorrow and the day after tomorrow
and depends on the attitude of the Czechoslovakian people
and the Czechoslovakian military towards the German
troops. He no longer trusts the government. He believes
in the honesty and straight forwardness of Hacha and
Chvalkovsky but doubts that the government will be able to
assert itself in the entire nation. The German Army had
already started out today, and at one barracks where resistance
was offered, it was ruthlessly broken; another barracks
had given in at the deployment of heavy artillery.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At 6 o’clock in the morning the German army would invade
Czechoslovakia from all sides and the German air force
would occupy the Czech airfields. There existed two possibilities.
The first one would be that the invasion of the
German troops would lead to a battle. In this case the resistance
will be broken by all means with physical force.
The other possibility is that the invasion of the German
troops occurs in bearable form. In that case it would be easy
for the Fuehrer to give Czechoslovakia at the new organization
of Czech life a generous life of her own, autonomy and
a certain national liberty.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We witnessed at the moment a great historical turning-point.
He would not like to torture and de-nationalize the
Czechs. He also did not do all that because of hatred but in
order to protect Germany. If Czechoslovakia in the fall of
<span class='pageno' title='575' id='Page_575'></span>
last year would not have yielded, the Czech people would
have been exterminated. Nobody could have prevented him
from doing that. It was his will that the Czech people should
live a full national life and he believed firmly that a way
could be found which would make far-reaching concessions
to the Czech desires. If fighting would break out tomorrow,
the pressure would result in counter-pressure. One would
annihilate one another and it would then not be possible any
more for him to give the promised alleviations. Within two
days the Czech army would not exist any more. Of course,
Germans would also be killed and this would result in a
hatred which would force him because of his instinct of
self-preservation not to grant autonomy any more. The world
would not move a muscle. He felt pity for the Czech
people when he read the foreign press. It gave him the impression
expressed in a German proverb: ‘The Moor has
done his duty, the Moor may go.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“That was the state of affairs. There were two courses open
to Germany, a harder one which did not want any concessions
and wished in memory of the past that Czechoslovakia
would be conquered with blood, and another one, the attitude
of which corresponded with his proposals stated above.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“That was the reason why he had asked Hacha to come here.
This invitation was the last good deed which he could offer
to the Czech people. If it would come to a fight, the bloodshed
would also force us to hate. But the visit of Hacha
could perhaps prevent the extreme. Perhaps it would contribute
to finding a form of construction which would be
much more far-reaching for Czechoslovakia than she could
ever have hoped for in old Austria. His aim was only to
create the necessary security for the German people.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The hours went past. At 6 o’clock the troops would march
in. He was almost ashamed to say that there was one German
division to each Czech battalion. The military action
was no small one, but planned with all generosity. He
would advise him now to retire with Chvalkovsky in order to
discuss what should be done.” (<span class='it'>2798-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In reply to this long harangue, Hacha, according to the German
minutes, said that he agreed that resistance would be useless.
He expressed doubt that he would be able to issue the necessary
orders to the Czech Army in the four hours left to him before the
German Army crossed the Czech border. He asked if the object
of the invasion was to disarm the Czech Army. If so, that might
be arranged. Hitler replied that his decision was final, that it
<span class='pageno' title='576' id='Page_576'></span>
was well known what a decision of the Fuehrer meant. He turned
to the circle of Nazi conspirators surrounding him, which included
Goering, Ribbentrop, and Keitel, for their support. The
only possibility of disarming the Czech Army, Hitler said, was
by the intervention of the German Army. At this point Hacha
and Chvalkovsky retired from the room. (<span class='it'>2798-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dispatch from the British Ambassador, Sir Neville Henderson,
published in the British Blue Book, describes a conversation
with Goering in which the events of this early morning meeting
are set forth (<span class='it'>2861-PS</span>). Dispatch No. 77 in the French Yellow
Book from M. Coulondre, the French Ambassador, gives another
well-informed version of this same midnight meeting (<span class='it'>2943-PS</span>).
The following account of the remainder of this meeting is drawn
from these two sources, as well as from the captured German
minutes (<span class='it'>2787-PS</span>). (Cf. also <span class='it'>3061-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>When President Hacha left the conference room in the Reichs
Chancellery, he was in such a state of exhaustion that he needed
medical attention from a physician who was on hand for that purpose.
It appears that he was given an injection to sustain him during
the ordeal. When the two Czechs returned to the room the Nazi
conspirators again told them of the power and invincibility of the
<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. They reminded him that in three hours, at 6 in the
morning, the German Army would cross the border. Goering
boasted of what the German <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> would do if Czech forces
resisted the invading Germans. If German lives were lost, Goering
said, his Luftwaffe would blast half Prague into ruins in two
hours. And that, Goering said, would be only the beginning. Under
this threat of imminent and merciless attack by land and air,
the President of Czechoslovakia at 4:30 in the morning signed
the document with which the Nazi conspirators confronted him.
This Declaration of 15 March 1939 reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“the President of the Czechoslovak State * * * entrusts
with entire confidence the destiny of the Czech people and
the Czech country to the hands of the Fuehrer of the German
Reich.” (<span class='it'>TC-49</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>While the Nazi officials were threatening and intimidating the
representatives of the Czech government, the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> had in
some areas already crossed the Czech border. The Czech industrial
centres of Maehrisch-Ostrau and Witkowitz, close to the Silesian
and Polish borders, were occupied by German troops and SS
units during the early evening of 14 March. An article in the
German military magazine, the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>, of 29 March 1939
describes the movement of German troops during the occupation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“From Silesia, Saxony and Northern Bavaria and the Ostmark,
<span class='pageno' title='577' id='Page_577'></span>
seven Army Corps moved on the morning of March
15 past the former Czech border. On the evening of March
14 parts of the VIII Army Corps and the SS Leibstandarte
Adolf Hitler, under the command of the Commanding General
of the VIII Army Corps, had already occupied the industrial
centers of Witkowitz and Maehrisch Ostrau.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The troops of Army Group 3 under the command of General
of Infantry Blaskowitz were to take Bohemia under their
protection, while the troops of Army Group 5 under General
of Inf. List were given the same mission for Moravia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For this purpose parts of the Air Force (particularly reconnaissance
planes and antiaircraft artillery) as well as
parts of the <span class='it'>SS Verfuegungstruppen</span> were placed at the disposal
of the two army groups.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On the evening of March 14, the march order was received
by the troops. On March 15 at 6 A. M. the columns moved
past the border and then moved on with utmost precision.

<p class='noindent'>(Other descriptions of the military movements of 14 and 15
March are contained in documents <span class='it'>2860-PS</span>, <span class='it'>3618-PS</span>, and <span class='it'>3619-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dawn on 15 March German troops poured into Czechoslovakia
from all sides. Hitler issued an order of the day to the
Armed Forces and a proclamation to the German people, which
stated succinctly, “Czechoslovakia has ceased to exist.” (<span class='it'>TC-50</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following day, in direct contravention of Article 81 of
the Treaty of Versailles, Czechoslovakia was formally incorporated
into the German Reich under the name of the “Protectorate
of Bohemia and Moravia.” This decree, signed in Prague
on 16 March 1939 by Hitler, Lammers, Frick, and Ribbentrop,
commenced with this declaration:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Bohemian-Moravian countries belonged for a millennium
to the living space of the German people.” (<span class='it'>TC-51</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The remainder of the decree sets forth in bleak detail the extent
to which Czechoslovakia henceforth was to be subjugated to
Germany. A German Protector was to be appointed by the Fuehrer
for the so-called Protectorate. The German Government assumed
charge of their foreign affairs and of their customs and
their excise. It was specified that German garrisons and military
establishments would be maintained in the Protectorate. (<span class='it'>TC-51</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time the extremist leaders in Slovakia, who at
German insistence had done so much to undermine the Czech
State, found that the independence of their week-old state was
in fact qualified. A Treaty of Protection between Slovakia and
<span class='pageno' title='578' id='Page_578'></span>
the Reich was signed in Vienna on 18 March and by Ribbentrop
in Berlin on 23 March (<span class='it'>1439-PS</span>). A secret protocol to this
treaty was also signed in Berlin on 23 March by Ribbentrop for
Germany, and by Tuka and Durcansky for Slovakia (<span class='it'>2793-PS</span>).
The first four articles of this treaty provide:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Government and the Slovak Government have
agreed, after the Slovak State has placed itself under the
protection of the German Reich, to regulate by treaty the
consequences resulting from this fact. For this purpose the
undersigned representatives of the two governments have
agreed on the following provisions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“ARTICLE 1. The German Reich undertakes to protect the
political independence of the State of Slovakia and the integrity
of its territory.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“ARTICLE 2. For the purpose of making effective the protection
undertaken by the German Reich, the German armed
forces shall have the right, at all times, to construct military
installations and to keep them garrisoned in the strength
they deem necessary, in an area delimited on its western side
by the frontiers of the State of Slovakia, and on its eastern
side by a line formed by the eastern rims of the Lower Carpathians,
the White Carpathians and the Javornik Mountains.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Government of Slovakia will take the necessary steps
to assure that the land required for these installations shall
be conveyed to the German armed forces. Furthermore the
Government of Slovakia will agree to grant exemption from
custom duties for imports from the Reich for the maintenance
of the German troops and the supply of military installations.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In their private conversations the Nazi conspirators gave
abundant evidence that they considered Slovakia a puppet State,
in effect a German possession. A memorandum of information
given by Hitler to von Brauchitsch on 25 March 1939 deals in
the main with problems arising from recently occupied Bohemia
and Moravia and Slovakia. It states in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Col. Gen. Keitel shall inform Slovak Government via Foreign
Office that it would not be allowed to keep or garrison
armed Slovak units (Hlinka Guards) on this side of the

to the new Slovak territory. Hlinka Guards should be disarmed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Slovak shall be requested via Foreign Office to deliver to
us against payment any arms we want and which are still
kept in Slovakia. This request is to be based upon agreement
made between Army and Czech troops. For this payment
these millions should be used which we will pour anyhow
into Slovakia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Czech Protectorate.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“H. Gr. [translator’s note: probably Army groups] shall be

the delivery of all arms within a stated time limit and under
the threat of severe penalties.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We take all war material of former Czechoslovakia <span class='it'>without</span>

though shall be paid for.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Bohemia-Moravia have to make annual contributions to the

<span class='pageno' title='580' id='Page_580'></span>

(<span class='it'>R-100</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The German conquest of Czechoslovakia in direct contravention
of the Munich agreement was the occasion for formal protests
from the British (<span class='it'>TC-52</span>) and French (<span class='it'>TC-53</span>) governments, both
dated 17 March 1939. On the same day, 17 March 1939, the Acting
Secretary of State of the United States issued a statement
which read in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * This Government, founded upon and dedicated to
the principles of human liberty and of democracy, cannot refrain
from making known this country’s condemnation of the
acts which have resulted in the temporary extinguishment
of the liberties of a free and independent people with whom,
from the day when the Republic of Czechoslovakia attained
its independence, the people of the United States have maintained
specially close and friendly relations.” (<span class='it'>2862-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>N. <span class='it'>The Importance of Czechoslovakia in Future Aggressions.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>With Czechoslovakia in German hands, the Nazi conspirators
had accomplished the program they had set for themselves in the
meeting in Berlin on 5 November 1937 (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). This program
of conquest had been intended to shorten Germany’s frontiers, to
increase its industrial and food reserves, and to place it in a position,
both industrially and strategically, from which the Nazis
could launch more ambitious and more devastating campaigns of
aggression. In less than a year and a half this program had been
carried through to the satisfaction of the Nazi leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the Nazi conspirators perhaps Goering was the most
aware of the economic and strategic advantages which would accrue
from the possession of Czechoslovakia. The Top Secret minutes
of a conference with Goering in the Air Ministry, held on
14 October 1938—just two weeks after the occupation of the
Sudetenland—reports a discussion of economic problems. At this
date Goering’s remarks were somewhat prophetic:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Sudetenland has to be exploited with all the means.
General Field Marshal Goering counts upon a complete industrial
assimilation of the Slovakia. Czechia and Slovakia
would become German dominions. Everything possible must
be taken out. The Oder-Danube Canal has to be speeded up.
Searches for oil and ore have to be conducted in Slovakia,
notably by State Secretary Keppler.” (<span class='it'>1301-PS, Item 10</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the summer of 1939, after the incorporation of Bohemia and
Moravia into the Reich, Goering again revealed the great interest
of the Nazi leaders in the Czechoslovak economic potential. The
<span class='pageno' title='581' id='Page_581'></span>
minutes dated Berlin, 27 July 1939, and signed Mueller, of a
conference two days earlier between Goering and a group of officials
from the OKW and from other agencies of the German
government concerned with war production, read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. In a rather long statement the Field Marshal explained
that the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia into the German
economy had taken place, among other reasons, to increase
the German war potential by exploitation of the industry
there. Letters, such as the decree of the Reich Minister
for Economics—S 10 402/39 of 10 July 39—as well as
a letter with similar meaning to the JUNKERS firm, which
might possibly lower the kind and extent of the armament
measures in the Protectorate, are contrary to this principle.
If it is necessary to issue such directives, this should be done
only with his consent. In any case, he insists, in agreement
with the directive by Hitler, that the war potential of the
Protectorate is definitely to be exploited in part or in full and
is to be directed towards mobilization as soon as possible.
* * *” (<span class='it'>R-133</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to strengthening the Nazi economic potential for
war, the conquest of Czechoslovakia provided the Nazis with new
bases from which to wage their next war of aggression, the attack
on Poland. It will be recalled that the minutes of the conference
between Goering and a pro-Nazi Slovak delegation in the
winter of 1938-39 state Goering’s conclusions as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Air bases in Slovakia are of great importance for the German
Air Force for use against the East.” (<span class='it'>2801-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a conference between Goering, Mussolini, and Ciano on 15
April 1939, one month after the conquest of Czechoslovakia, Goering
told his junior partners in the Axis of the progress of German
preparations for war. He compared the strength of Germany
with the strength of England and France. He mentioned the
German occupation of Czechoslovakia in these words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“However, the heavy armament of Czechoslovakia shows, in
any case, how dangerous this country could have been, even
after Munich, in the event of a serious conflict. Because of
Germany’s action the situation of both Axis countries was
ameliorated, among other reasons because of the economic
possibilities which result from the transfer to Germany of
the great production capacity (armament potential) of
Czechoslovakia. That contributes toward a considerable
strengthening of the axis against the Western powers.
Furthermore, Germany now need not keep ready a single
division for protection against that country in case of a bigger
<span class='pageno' title='582' id='Page_582'></span>
conflict. This, too, is an advantage by which both axis
countries will, in the last analysis, benefit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * the action taken by Germany in Czechoslovakia
is to be viewed as an advantage for the axis in case Poland
should finally join the enemies of the axis powers. Germany
could then attack this country from 2 flanks and would be
within only 25 minutes flying distance from the new Polish
industrial center which had been moved further into the interior
of the country, nearer to the other Polish industrial
districts, because of its proximity to the border. Now by
the turn of events it is located again in the proximity of the
border.” (<span class='it'>1874-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The absorption of the Sudetenland, effected on 1 October 1938,
in practical effect destroyed Czechoslovakia as a military power.
The final conquest of Czechoslovakia came on 15 March 1939.
This conquest had been the intention and aim of the Nazi leaders
during the preparations for Case Green in the summer of 1938,
and had been forestalled only by the Munich agreement. With
Czechoslovakia, less than six months after the Munich agreement,
securely in German hands, the Nazi conspirators had
achieved their objective. Bohemia and Moravia were incorporated
into the Reich, shortening German frontiers and adding the
Czech manufacturing plant to the German war potential. The
puppet state of Slovakia, conceived in Berlin and independent only
in name, had been set up to the east of Moravia. In this state,
which outflanked Poland to the south, the Nazi army, under the
terms of the treaty drafted by Ribbentrop, took upon itself the
establishment of bases and extensive military installations. From
this state in September 1939 units of the German Army did, in
fact, carry out the attack on Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Logic and premeditation are patent in each step of the German
aggression. Each conquest of the Nazi conspirators was deliberately
planned as a stepping-stone to new and more ambitious aggression.
The words of Hitler in the conference in the Reichs
Chancellery on 23 May 1939, when he was planning the Polish
campaign, are significant,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The period which lies behind us has indeed been put to good
use. All measures have been taken in the correct sequence
and in harmony with our aims.” (<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is appropriate to refer to two other speeches of the Nazi
leaders. In his lecture at Munich on 7 November 1943 Jodl spoke
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The bloodless solution of the Czech conflict in the autumn
<span class='pageno' title='583' id='Page_583'></span>
of 1938 and spring of 1939 and the annexation of Slovakia
rounded off the territory of Greater Germany in such a way
that it now became possible to consider the Polish problem
on the basis of more or less favourable strategic premises.”
(<span class='it'>L-172</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In the speech to his military commanders on 23 November 1939,
Hitler described the process by which he had rebuilt the military
power of the Reich:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The next step was Bohemia, Moravia and Poland. This step
also was not possible to accomplish in one campaign. First
of all, the western fortifications had to be finished. It was
not possible to reach the goal in one effort. It was clear to
me from the first moment that I could not be satisfied with
the Sudeten-German territory. That was only a partial solution.
The decision to march into Bohemia was made. Then
followed the erection of the Protectorate and with that the
basis for the action against Poland was laid.” (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>)</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg593a'>5. OPENING ADDRESS FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The following address, opening the British presentation of the
case under Count II of the Indictment, was delivered by Sir Hartley
Shawcross, K.C., M.P., British Attorney General and Chief
Prosecutor for the United Kingdom, before the Tribunal on 4
December 1945.</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>PART I</p>

<p class='pindent'>On an occasion to which reference has already been made
Hitler, the Leader of the Nazi Conspirators who are now on trial
before you, said in reference to their warlike plans:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I shall give a propagandist cause for starting the war,
never mind whether it be true or not. The victor shall not
be asked later on whether we tell the truth or not. In starting
and making a war not the right is what matters but victory—the
strongest has the right.” (<span class='it'>1014-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The British Empire has twice been victorious in wars which
have been forced upon it within the space of one generation but it
is precisely because we realize that victory is not enough; that
might is not necessarily right; that lasting peace and the rule of
International Law is not to be achieved by the strong arm alone,
that the British Nation is taking part in this trial. There are those
who would perhaps say that these wretched men should have been
dealt with summarily without trial by “executive action”; that
their personal power for evil broken, they should be swept aside
into oblivion without this elaborate and careful investigation as
to the part they played in plunging the world in war. <span class='it'>Vae Victis.</span>
Let them pay the penalty of defeat. But that is not the view of
the British Empire or of the British Government. Not so would
the Rule of Law be raised and strengthened on the international
as well as the municipal plane; not so would future generations
realize that right is not always on the side of the big battalions;
not so would the world be made aware that the waging of aggressive
war is not only a dangerous venture but a criminal one.
Human memory is short. Apologists for defeated nations are
sometimes able to play upon the sympathy and magnanimity of
their victors so that the true facts, never authoritatively recorded,
become obscured and forgotten. One has only to recall the circumstances
following the last world war to see the dangers to
which, in the absence of any authoritative judicial pronouncement
a tolerant or a credulous people is exposed. With the passage
of time the former tend to discount, perhaps because of
their very horror, the stories of aggression and atrocity which
may be handed down; the latter, misled by fanatical and dishonest
<span class='pageno' title='594' id='Page_594'></span>
propagandists, come to believe that it was not they but
their opponents who were guilty of what they would themselves
condemn. And so we believe that this Tribunal, acting, as we
know it will act notwithstanding its appointment by the victorious
powers, with complete and judicial objectivity, will provide
a contemporary touchstone and an authoritative and impartial
record to which future historians may turn for truth and future
politicians for warning. From this record all generations shall
know not only what our generation suffered but also that our suffering
was the result of crimes against the laws of peoples which
the peoples of the world enforced and will continue in the future
to uphold by international cooperation, not based merely on military
alliances but firmly grounded in the rule of law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor, though this procedure and this Indictment of individuals
may be novel, is there anything new in the principles which by
this prosecution we seek to enforce. Ineffective though, alas, the
sanctions proved themselves to be, the Nations of the world had,
as it will be my purpose to show, sought to make aggressive war
an international crime, and although previous tradition has sought
to punish States rather than individuals, it is both logical and
right that if the act of waging war is itself an offense against
International Law those individuals who shared personal responsibility
for bringing such wars about should answer personally
for the course into which they lead their states. Again, individual
war crimes have long been regarded by International Law
as triable by the Courts of those States whose nationals have been
outraged at least so long as a state of war persists. It would
indeed be illogical in the extreme if those who, although they may
not with their own hands have committed individual crimes, were
responsible for systematic breaches of the laws of war affecting
the nationals of many States should escape. So also in regard to
crimes against humanity. The right of humanitarian intervention
on behalf of the rights of man trampled upon by the State
in a manner shocking the sense of mankind has long been considered
to form part of the law of Nations. Here, too, the Charter
merely develops a pre-existing principle. If murder, raping
and robbery are indictable under the ordinary municipal laws of
our countries shall those who differ only from the common criminal
by the extent and systematic nature of their offenses escape
accusation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, as I shall show, the view of the British Government that
in these matters the Tribunal will apply to individuals not the
law of the victor but the accepted principles of international
usage in a way which will, if anything can, promote and fortify
<span class='pageno' title='595' id='Page_595'></span>
the rule of International Law and safeguard the future peace and
security of this war-stricken world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By agreement between the Chief Prosecutors it is my task on
behalf of the British Government and of the other States associated
on this Prosecution to present the case on Count 2 of the
Indictment and to show how these Defendants in conspiracy with
each other and with persons not now before this Tribunal planned
and waged a war of aggression in breach of the Treaty obligations
by which, under International Law Germany, as other
States, had sought to make such wars impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That task falls into two parts. The first is to demonstrate the
nature and the basis of the Crime against Peace which, under
the Charter of this Tribunal, is constituted by waging wars of
aggression and in violation of Treaties. The second is to establish
beyond doubt that such wars were waged by these Defendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the first, it would no doubt be sufficient to say this. It
is not incumbent upon the Prosecution to prove that wars of aggression
and wars in violation of International Treaties are, or
ought to be, International Crimes. The Charter of this Tribunal
has prescribed that they are crimes and that the Charter is the
Statute and the law of this Court. Yet, though that is the clear
and mandatory law governing the jurisdiction of this Tribunal,
we feel that we should not be fully discharging our task in the
abiding interest alike of international justice and morality unless
we showed the position of that provision of the Charter against
the whole perspective of International Law. For just as some
old English Statutes were substantially declaratory of the Common
Law, so this Charter substantially declares and creates a
jurisdiction in respect of what was already the Laws of Nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor is it unimportant to emphasize that aspect of the matter
lest there be some, now or hereafter, who might allow their judgment
to be warped by plausible catchwords or by an uninformed
and distorted sense of justice towards these Defendants. It is
not difficult to be misled by such phrases as that resort to war in
the past has not been a crime; that the power to resort to war
is one of the prerogatives of the sovereign State; that the Charter
in constituting wars of aggression a crime has imitated one of the
most obnoxious doctrines of National Socialist jurisprudence,
namely <span class='it'>post factum</span> legislation; that the Charter is in this respect
reminiscent of Bills of Attainder—and that these proceedings
are no more than a measure of vengeance, subtly concealed
in the garb of judicial proceedings which the Victor wreaks upon
the Vanquished. These things may sound plausible—yet they
<span class='pageno' title='596' id='Page_596'></span>
are not true. It is, indeed, not necessary to doubt that some
aspects of the Charter bear upon them the imprint of significant
and salutary novelty. But it is our submission and conviction,
which we affirm before this Tribunal and the world that fundamentally
the provision of the Charter which constitutes such wars
as these Defendants joined in waging and in planning a crime is
not in any way an innovation. That provision does no more
than constitute a competent jurisdiction for the punishment of
what not only the enlightened conscience of mankind but the Law
of Nations itself constituted an International Crime before this
Tribunal was established and this Charter became part of the
public law of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So first let this be said. Whilst it may be true that there is no
body of international rules amounting to law in the Austinian
sense of a rule imposed by a sovereign upon a subject obliged to
obey it under some definite sanction, yet for fifty years or more
the people of the world, striving perhaps after that ideal of
which the poet speaks:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>When the War Drums throb no longer</p>
<p class='line0'>And the Battle Flags are furled,</p>
<p class='line0'>In the Parliament of Man,</p>
<p class='line0'>The Federation of the World</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>have sought to create an operative system of rules based on the
consent of nations to stabilize international relations, to avoid
war taking place at all and to mitigate the results of such wars
as took place. The first such treaty was of course the Hague
Convention of 1899 for the Pacific Settlement of International
Disputes. This was, indeed, of little more than precatory effect
and we attach no weight to it for the purpose of this case, but it
did establish agreement that in the event of serious disputes
arising between the signatory powers, they would so far as possible
submit to mediation. That Convention was followed in
1907 by another Convention reaffirming and slightly strengthening
what had previously been agreed. These early conventions
fell indeed very far short of outlawing war or of creating any
binding obligation to arbitrate. I shall certainly not ask you to
say any crime was committed by disregarding them. But at least
they established that the contracting powers accepted the general
principle that if at all possible war should be resorted to only if
mediation failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although these Conventions are mentioned in the Indictment I
do not rely on them save to show the historical development of
the law. It is unnecessary, therefore, to argue about their effect,
<span class='pageno' title='597' id='Page_597'></span>
for their place has been taken by more effective instruments.
They were the first steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were, of course, other individual agreements between
particular States which sought to preserve the neutrality of individual
countries as, for instance, that of Belgium, but those
agreements were, in the absence of any real will to comply with
them, entirely inadequate to prevent the first World War in 1914.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shocked by the occurrence of that catastrophe the Nations of
Europe, not excluding Germany, and of other parts of the World
came to the conclusion that in the interests of all alike a permanent
organization of the Nations should be established to maintain
the peace. And so the Treaty of Versailles was prefaced by
the Covenant of the League of Nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I say nothing at this moment of the general merits of the various
provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. They have been criticized,
some of them perhaps justly, and they were made the subject
of much warlike propaganda in Germany. But it is unnecessary
to enquire into the merits of the matter, for however unjust
one might for this purpose assume the Treaty to be, it contained
no kind of excuse for the waging of war to secure an alteration in
its terms. For not only was it a settlement by agreement of all
the difficult territorial questions which had been left outstanding
by the war itself but it established the League of Nations which,
if it had been loyally supported, could so well have resolved those
international differences which might otherwise have led, as they
did lead, to war. It set up in the Council of the League, in the
Assembly and in the Permanent Court of International Justice,
a machine not only for the peaceful settlement of international
disputes but also for the ventilation of all international questions
by frank and open discussion. At the time the hopes of the world
stood high. Millions of men in all countries—perhaps even in
Germany—had laid down their lives in what they believed and
hoped to be a war to end war. Germany herself entered the
League and was given a permanent seat on the Council, on which,
as in the Assembly, German Governments which preceded that
of the Defendant Von Papen in 1932 played their full part. In
the years from 1919 to 1932 despite some minor incidents in the
heated atmosphere which followed the end of the war, the peaceful
operation of the League continued. Nor was it only the operation
of the League which gave good ground for hope that at long
last the rule of law would replace that of anarchy in the international
field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Statesmen of the world deliberately set out to make wars
of aggression an international Crime. These are no new terms,
<span class='pageno' title='598' id='Page_598'></span>
invented by the Victors to embody in this Charter. They have
figured prominently in numerous treaties, in governmental pronouncements
and in declarations of Statesmen in the period preceding
the Second World War. In treaties concluded between
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other States—such
as Persia (1 October 1927), France (2 May 1935), China (21
August 1937)—the Contracting Parties undertook to refrain
from any act of aggression whatsoever against the other Party.
In 1933 the Soviet Union became a party to a large number of
treaties containing a detailed definition of aggression. The same
definition appeared in the same year in the authoritative Report
of the Committee on Questions of Security set up in connection
with the Conference for the Reduction and the Limitation of
Armaments. But States went beyond commitments to refrain
from wars of aggression and to assist States victims of aggression.
They <span class='it'>condemned</span> wars of aggression. Thus in the Anti-War
Treaty of Non-Aggression and Conciliation of 10 October
1933, a number of American States—subsequently joined by
practically all the States of the American Continent and a number
of European countries—the Contracting Parties solemnly
declared that “they condemned wars of aggression in their mutual
relations or in those of other States.” That Treaty was fully
incorporated into the Buenos Aires Convention of December 1936
signed and ratified by a large number of American countries,
including the United States of America. Previously, in February
1928, the Sixth Pan-American Conference adopted a Resolution
declaring that as “war of aggression constitutes a crime against
the human species * * * all aggression is illicit and as such is
declared prohibited.” In September 1927 the Assembly of the
League of Nations adopted a resolution affirming the conviction
that “a war of aggression can never serve as a means of settling
international disputes <span class='it'>and is, in consequence, an international
crime</span>” and declaring that “all wars of aggression are, and shall
always be, prohibited.” The first Article of the Draft Treaty for
Mutual Assistance of 1923 reads: “The High Contracting Parties,
affirming that aggressive war is an international crime, undertake
the solemn engagement not to make themselves guilty of this
crime against any other nation.” In the Preamble to the Geneva
Protocol of 1924 it was stated that “offensive warfare constitutes
an infraction of solidarity and an international crime.” These
instruments remained unratified, for various reasons, but they
are not without significance or instruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These repeated condemnations of wars of aggression testified
to the fact that, with the establishment of the League of Nations
<span class='pageno' title='599' id='Page_599'></span>
and with the legal developments which followed it, the place of
war in International Law had undergone a profound change.
War was ceasing to be the unrestricted prerogative of sovereign
States. The Covenant of the League did not totally abolish the
right of war. It left certain gaps which probably were larger in
theory than in practice. In effect it surrounded the right of war
by procedural and substantive checks and delays which, if the
Covenant had been observed, would have amounted to an elimination
of war not only between Members of the League, but also,
by virtue of certain provisions of the Covenant, in the relations
of non-Members. Thus the Covenant restored the position as it
existed at the dawn of International Law, at the time when
Grotius was laying the foundations of the modern law of nations
and established the distinction, accompanied by profound legal
consequences in the sphere of neutrality, between just and unjust
wars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither was that development arrested with the adoption of
the Covenant. The right of war was further circumscribed by a
series of treaties—numbering nearly one thousand—of arbitration
and conciliation embracing practically all the nations of the
world. The so-called Optional Clause of Article 36 of the Statute
of the Permanent Court of International Justice which conferred
upon the Court compulsory jurisdiction with regard to most comprehensive
categories of disputes and which constituted in effect
the most important compulsory treaty of arbitration in the post-war
period, was widely signed and ratified. Germany herself
signed it in 1927; her signature was renewed and renewed, for a
period of five years, by the National-Socialist Government in July
1933. (Significantly, that ratification was not renewed on the
expiration of its validity in March 1938.) Since 1928 a considerable
number of States signed and ratified the General Act for the
Pacific Settlement of International Disputes which was designed
to fill the gaps left by the Optional Clause and the existing treaties
of arbitration and conciliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this vast network of instruments of pacific settlement testified
to the growing conviction that war was ceasing to be the
normal and legitimate means of settling international disputes.
The express condemnation of wars of aggression, which has already
been mentioned, supplied the same testimony. But there
was more direct evidence pointing in that direction. The Treaty
of Locarno of 16th October 1925, to which I will refer later and
to which Germany was a party, was more than a treaty of arbitration
and conciliation in which the parties undertook definite obligations
with regard to the pacific settlement of disputes that
<span class='pageno' title='600' id='Page_600'></span>
might arise between them. It was, subject to clearly specified exceptions
of self-defense in certain contingencies, a more general
undertaking in which the parties agreed that “they will in no
case attack or invade each other or resort to war against each
other”. This constituted a general renunciation of war and was
so considered to be in the eyes of jurists and of the public opinion
of the world. For the Locarno Treaty was not just one of the
great number of arbitration treaties concluded at that time. It
was regarded as the cornerstone of the European settlement and
of the new legal order in Europe in partial, voluntary and generous
substitution for the just rigours of the Treaty of Versailles.
With it the term “outlawry of war” left the province of mere
pacifist propaganda. It became current in the writings on international
law and in official pronouncements of governments. No
jurist of authority and no statesman of responsibility would have
associated himself, subsequent to the Locarno Treaty, with the
plausible assertion that, at least as between the parties, war had
remained an unrestricted right of sovereign States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But although the effect of the Locarno Treaty was limited to
the parties to it, it had a wider influence in paving the way towards
that most fundamental and truly revolutionary enactment
in modern international law, namely, the General Treaty for the
Renunciation of War of 27 August 1928, known also as the Pact
of Paris, or the Kellogg-Briand Pact, or the Kellogg Pact. That
Treaty—a most deliberate and carefully prepared piece of international
legislation—was binding in 1939 upon more than sixty
nations, including Germany. It was—and has remained—the
most widely signed and ratified international instrument. It contained
no provision for its termination, and was conceived as the
cornerstone of any future international order worthy of that
name. It is fully part of international law as it stands today,
and has in no way been modified or replaced by the Charter of
the United Nations. It is right, in this solemn hour in the history
of the world when the responsible leaders of a State stand
accused of a premeditated breach of this great Treaty which was—and
remains—a source of hope and faith for mankind, to set
out in detail its two operative Articles and its Preamble:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce
it as an instrument of national policy in their relations
with one another.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“Article II</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In that General Treaty for the Renunciation of War practically
the entire civilized world abolished war as a legally permissible
means of enforcing the law and of changing it. The right of war
was no longer of the essence of sovereignty. Whatever the position
may have been in 1914 or in 1918 (and it is not necessary
to discuss it) no International lawyer of repute, no responsible
Statesman, no soldier concerned with the legal use of Armed
Forces could doubt that with the Pact of Paris on the Statute
Book a war of aggression was contrary to positive International
Law. Nor have the repeated violations of the Pact of the Axis
Powers in any way affected its validity. Let this be firmly and
clearly stated. Those very breaches, except to the cynic and the
malevolent, have added to its strength; they provoked the sustained
wrath of people angered by the contemptuous disregard of
the great Statute and determined to vindicate its provisions. The
Pact of Paris is the Law of Nations. This Tribunal will enforce
it.
<span class='pageno' title='602' id='Page_602'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Let this also be said. The Pact of Paris was not a clumsy
enactment likely to become a signpost for the guilty. It did not
enable Germany to go to war against Poland and yet rely, as
against Great Britain and France, on any immunity from warlike
action because of the provisions of the Pact of Paris. For
that Pact laid down expressly in its Preamble that no State guilty
of a violation of its provisions may invoke its benefits. When on
the outbreak of the Second World War Great Britain and France
communicated to the League of Nations the fact that a state of
war existed between them and Germany as from 3 September,
1939, they declared that by committing an act of aggression
against Poland Germany had violated her obligations assumed
not only towards Poland but also towards other signatories of
the Pact of Paris. A violation of the Pact in relation to one signatory
was an attack upon all the other signatories and they were
fully entitled to treat it as such. This point is to be emphasized
lest any of the defendants should seize upon the letter of the
Particulars of Count Two of the Indictment and maintain that
it was not Germany who initiated war with the United Kingdom
and France on 3 September 1939. The declaration of war came
from the United Kingdom and France; the act of war and its
commencement came from Germany in violation of the fundamental
enactment to which she was a party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The General Treaty for the Renunciation of War, the great
constitutional instrument of an international society awakened to
the deadly dangers of another Armageddon, did not remain an
isolated effort soon to be forgotten in the turmoil of recurrent
international crises. It became, in conjunction with the Covenant
of the League of Nations or independently of it, the starting
point for a new orientation of governments in matters of peace,
war and neutrality. It is of importance to quote some of these
statements and declarations. In 1929, His Majesty’s Government
in the United Kingdom said, in connection with the question of
conferring upon the Permanent Court of International Justice
jurisdiction with regard to the exercise of belligerent rights in
relation to neutral States:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * But the whole situation * * * rests, and International
Law on the subject has been entirely built up,
on the assumption that there is nothing illegitimate in the
use of war as an instrument of national policy, and, as a
necessary corollary, that the position and rights of neutrals
are entirely independent of the circumstances of any war
which may be in progress. Before the acceptance of the
Covenant, the basis of the law of neutrality was that the
<span class='pageno' title='603' id='Page_603'></span>
rights and obligations of neutrals were identical as regards
both belligerents, and were entirely independent of the rights
and wrongs of the dispute which had led to the war, or the
respective position of the belligerents at the bar of world
opinion.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Now it is precisely this assumption which is no
longer valid as regards states which are members of the
League of Nations and parties to the Peace Pact. The effect
of those instruments, taken together, is to deprive nations of
the right to employ war as an instrument of national policy,
and to forbid the states which have signed them to give aid
or comfort to an offender. As between such states, there has
been in consequence a fundamental change in the whole question
of belligerent and neutral rights. The whole policy of
His Majesty’s present Government (and, it would appear, of
any alternative government) is based upon a determination to
comply with their obligations under the Covenant of the
League and the Peace Pact. This being so, the situation
which we have to envisage in the event of a war in which we
were engaged is not one in which the rights and duties of
belligerents and neutrals will depend upon the old rules of
war and neutrality, but one in which the position of the members
of the League will be determined by the Covenant and
the Pact. * * *” (Memorandum on the Signature of His
Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom of the Optional
Clause of the Statute, Misc. No. 12 (1929), Cmd.
3452, p. 9).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Chief of Counsel for the United States referred in his opening
speech before this Tribunal to the weighty pronouncement of
Mr. Stimson, the Secretary of State, in which, in 1932, he gave
expression to the drastic change brought about in International
Law by the Pact of Paris. It is convenient to quote the relevant
passage in full:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“War between nations was renounced by the signatories of
the Briand-Kellogg Treaty. This means that it has become
illegal throughout practically the entire world. It is no longer
to be the source and subject of rights. It is no longer to be
the principle around which the duties, the conduct, and the
rights of nations revolve. It is an illegal thing. Hereafter
when two nations engage in armed conflict either one or both
of them must be wrongdoers—violators of this general treaty
law. We no longer draw a circle about them and treat them
with the punctilios of the duelist’s code. Instead we denounce
them as law-breakers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='604' id='Page_604'></span>
Nearly ten years later, when numerous independent States lay
prostrate, shattered or menaced in their very existence before the
impact of the war machine of the Nazi State, the Attorney-General
of the United States—subsequently a distinguished member
of the highest tribunal of that great country—gave weighty expression
to the change which had been effected in the law as the
result of the General Treaty for the Renunciation of War. He
said on 27 March 1941:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, in which Germany,
Italy and Japan covenanted with us, as well as with
other nations, to renounce war as an instrument of policy,
made definite the outlawry of war and of necessity altered
the dependent concept of neutral obligations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The Treaty for the Renunciation of War and the
Argentine Anti-War Treaty deprived their signatories of the
right of war as an instrument of national policy or aggression
and rendered unlawful wars undertaken in violation of
their provisions. In consequence, these treaties destroyed
the historical and juridical foundations of the doctrine of
neutrality conceived as an attitude of absolute impartiality
in relation to aggressive wars. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It follows that the state which has gone to war in violation
of its obligations acquires no right to equality of treatment
from other states, unless treaty obligations require different
handling of affairs. It derives no rights from its illegality.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * In flagrant cases of aggression where the facts
speak so unambiguously that world opinion takes what may
be the equivalent of judicial notice, we may not stymie International
Law and allow these great treaties to become
dead letters. Intelligent public opinion of the world which
is not afraid to be vocal and the action of the American States
has made a determination that the Axis Powers are the aggressors
in the wars today which is an appropriate basis in
the present state of international organization for our policy.
* * *”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There is thus no doubt that by the time the National-Socialist
State had embarked upon the preparation of the war of aggression
against the civilized world and by the time it had accomplished
that design, aggressive war had, in virtue of the Pact of
Paris and of other treaties, become illegal beyond all uncertainty
and doubt. It is on that Universal Treaty that Count 2 is principally
based.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution has deemed it necessary—indeed imperative—to
establish beyond all possibility of doubt, at what may appear to
<span class='pageno' title='605' id='Page_605'></span>
be excessive length, that only superficial learning or culpable sentimentality
can assert that there is any significant element of retroactive
law in the determination of the authors of the Charter
to treat aggressive war as conduct which International Law has
prohibited and stigmatized as criminal. We have traced the progressive
limitation of the right of war, the renunciation and condemnation
of wars of aggression, and, above all, the total prohibition
and condemnation of all war conceived as an instrument of
national policy. What statesman or politician in charge of the
affairs of a nation could doubt, from 1928 onwards, that aggressive
war, that all war—except in self-defense, or for the collective
enforcement of the law, or against a State which has itself
violated the Pact of Paris—was unlawful and outlawed? What
statesman or politician embarking upon such war could reasonably
and justifiably count upon an immunity other than that by
a successful outcome of the criminal venture? What more decisive
evidence of a prohibition laid down by positive International
Law could any lawyer desire than that which has been adduced
here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are, it is true, some small town lawyers who deny the
existence of any International Law. Indeed, as I have said, the
rules of the law of Nations may not satisfy the Austinian test of
being imposed by a sovereign. But the legal regulation of International
Relations rests upon quite different juridical foundations.
It depends upon consent, but upon consent which cannot be
withdrawn by unilateral action. In the International field the
source of law is not the command of a sovereign but the treaty
agreement binding upon every state which has adhered to it. It
is indeed true—and the recognition of its truth today by all the
great Powers of the World is vital to our future peace—that as
M. Litvinoff once said, and as Great Britain fully accepts, “Absolute
Sovereignty and entire liberty of action only belong to such
states as have not undertaken International obligations. Immediately
a state accepts International obligations it limits its
sovereignty”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it may be argued that although war had been outlawed and
forbidden it was not criminally outlawed and forbidden. International
Law, it may be said, does not attribute criminality to
states, still less to individuals. But can it really be said on behalf
of these Defendants that the offense of these aggressive
wars, which plunged millions of peoples to their deaths, which by
dint of war crimes and crimes against humanity brought about
the torture and extermination of countless thousands of innocent
civilians; which devastated cities; which destroyed the amenities—nay
<span class='pageno' title='606' id='Page_606'></span>
the most rudimentary necessities of civilization in many
countries, which has brought the world to the brink of ruin from
which it will take generations to recover—will it seriously be
said that such a war is only an offense, only an illegality, only a
matter of condemnation and not a crime justiciable by any Tribunal?
No Law worthy of the name can permit itself to be reduced
to an absurdity. Certainly the Great Powers responsible
for this Charter have refused to allow it. They drew the inescapable
consequences from the renunciation, prohibition, and condemnation
of war which had become part of the law of Nations.
They refused to reduce justice to impotence by subscribing to the
outworn doctrines that the sovereign state can commit no crime
and that no crime can be committed by individuals on its behalf.
Their refusal so to stultify themselves has decisively shaped the
law of this Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this be an innovation, it is innovation long overdue—a desirable
and beneficent innovation fully consistent with justice,
with common sense and with the abiding purposes of the law of
Nations. But is it indeed so clear an innovation? Or is it no
more than the logical development of the law? There was indeed
a time when International lawyers used to maintain that the
liability of a State was, because of its sovereignty, limited to contractual
responsibility. International tribunals have not accepted
that view. They have repeatedly affirmed that a State can commit
a tort; that it may be guilty of trespass, of a nuisance, of
negligence. They have gone further. They have held that a State
may be bound to pay what are in effect penal damages for failing
to provide proper conditions of security to aliens residing within
their territory. In a recent case decided in 1935 between the
United States and Canada an arbitral commission, with the concurrence
of its American member, decided that the United States
were bound to pay what amounted to penal damages for an
affront to Canadian sovereignty. On a wider plane the Covenant
of the League of Nations, in providing for sanctions, recognized
the principle of enforcement of the law against collective units—such
enforcement to be, if necessary, of a penal character. There
is thus nothing startlingly new in the adoption of the principle
that the State as such is responsible for its criminal acts. In
fact, save for the reliance on the unconvincing argument of sovereignty,
there is in law no reason why a State should not be
answerable for crimes committed on its behalf. In a case decided
nearly one hundred years ago Dr. Lushington, a great English
Admiralty judge, refused to admit that a State cannot be a pirate.
History, very recent history, does not warrant the view that a
<span class='pageno' title='607' id='Page_607'></span>
State cannot be a criminal. On the contrary, the immeasurable
potentialities for evil inherent in the State in this age of science
and organization would seem to demand imperatively means of
repression of criminal conduct even more drastic and more effective
than in the case of individuals. In so far therefore as the
Charter has put on record the principle of the criminal responsibility
of the State it must be applauded as a wise and far-seeing
measure of international legislation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Admittedly, the conscience shrinks from the rigours of collective
punishment, which fall upon the guilty and the innocent
alike—although, it may be noted, most of those innocent victims
would not have hesitated to reap the fruits of the criminal act if
it had been successful. Humanity and justice will find means of
mitigating any injustice of collective punishment. Above all,
much hardship can be obviated by making the punishment fall
upon the individuals directly responsible for the criminal conduct
of the State. It is here that the Powers who framed the Charter
took a step which justice, sound legal sense and an enlightened
appreciation of the good of mankind must acclaim without cavil
or reserve. The Charter lays down expressly that there shall
be individual responsibility for the crimes, including the crime
against the peace, committed on behalf of the State. The State is
not an abstract entity. Its rights and duties are the rights and
duties of men. Its actions are the actions of men. It is a salutory
principle of the law that politicians who embark upon a war
of aggression should not be able to seek immunity behind the
intangible personality of the State. It is a salutory legal rule
that persons who, in violation of the law, plunge their own and
other countries into an aggressive war, do so with a halter round
their necks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To say that those who aid and abet, who counsel and procure a
crime are themselves criminals is a commonplace in our own
municipal jurisprudence. Nor is the principle of individual international
responsibility for offenses against the law of nations
altogether new. It has been applied not only to pirates. The
entire law relating to war crimes—as distinguished from the
crime of war—is based on that principle. The future of International
Law and, indeed, of the world, depends on its application
in a much wider sphere—in particular in that of safeguarding
the peace of the world. There must be acknowledged not
only, as in the Charter of the United Nations, fundamental
human rights, but also, as in the Charter of this Tribunal, fundamental
human duties. Of these none is more vital or more fundamental
than the duty not to vex the peace of nations in violation
<span class='pageno' title='608' id='Page_608'></span>
of the clearest legal prohibitions and undertakings. If this is
an innovation, then it is one which we are prepared to defend and
to justify. It is not an innovation which creates a new crime.
International Law had already, before the Charter was adopted,
constituted aggressive war a criminal act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is therefore in this respect no substantial retroactivity
in the provisions of the Charter. It merely fixes the responsibility
for a crime, clearly established as such by positive law, upon its
actual perpetrators. It fills a gap in international criminal procedure.
There is all the difference between saying to a man: “You
will now be punished for an act which was not a crime at the
time you committed it”, and telling him: “You will now pay the
penalty for conduct which was contrary to law and a crime when
you executed it though, owing to the imperfection of international
machinery, there was at that time no court competent to pronounce
judgment against you.” If that be retroactivity, we proclaim
it to be most fully consistent with that higher justice which,
in the practice of civilized States, has set a definite limit to the
retroactive operation of laws. Let the defendants and their protagonists
complain that the Charter is in this as in other matters
an <span class='it'>ex parte</span> fiat of the victor. These victors, composing as
they do the overwhelming majority of the nations of the world,
represent also the world’s sense of justice which would be outraged
if the crime of war, after this second World War, were to
remain unpunished. In thus interpreting, declaring and supplementing
the existing law they are content to be judged by the
verdict of history. <span class='it'>Securus judicat orbis terrarum.</span> In so far as
the Charter of this Tribunal introduces new law, its authors have
established a precedent for the future—a precedent operative
against all, including themselves. In essence that law, rendering
recourse to aggressive war an international crime, had been well
established when the Charter was adopted. It is only by way of
corruption of language that it can be described as a retroactive
law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There remains the question, with which it will not be necessary
to detain the Tribunal for long, whether these wars launched by
Germany and her leaders in violation of treaties, agreements or
assurances, were also wars of aggression. A war of aggression
is one which is resorted to in violation of the international obligation
not to have recourse to war or, in cases in which war is
not totally renounced, when it is resorted to in disregard of the
duty to utilize the procedure of pacific settlement which a State
has bound itself to observe. There was indeed, in the period between
the two World Wars, a divergence of view among jurists
<span class='pageno' title='609' id='Page_609'></span>
and statesmen whether it was preferable to attempt in advance a
legal definition of aggression or to leave to the States concerned
and to the collective organs of the international community freedom
of appreciation of the facts in any particular situation that
might arise. Those holding the latter view urged that a rigid
definition might be abused by an unscrupulous State to fit in with
its aggressive design; they feared, and the British Government
was for a time among those who thought so, that an automatic
definition of aggression might become “a trap for the innocent
and sign-post for the guilty”. Others held that in the interest of
certainty and security a definition of aggression, like a definition
of any crime in municipal law, was proper and useful; they urged
that the competent international organs, political and judicial,
could be trusted to avoid any particular case a definition of aggression
which might lead to obstruction or to an absurdity. In
May 1933 the Committee on Security Questions of the Disarmament
Conference proposed a definition of aggression on the following
lines:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The aggressor in an international conflict shall, subject to
the agreements in force between the parties to the dispute,
be considered to be that State which is the first to commit any
of the following actions:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;declaration of war upon another state;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;invasion by its armed forces, with or without a declaration
of war, of the territory of another State;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;attack by its land, naval, or air forces, with or without
a declaration of war, on the territory, vessels, or aircraft of
another State;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;naval blockade of the coasts or ports of another State;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;provision of support to armed bands formed in its
territory which have invaded the territory of another State,
or refusal, notwithstanding the request of the invaded State,
to take in its own territory all the measures in its power to
deprive those bands of all assistance or protection.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The various treaties concluded in 1933 by the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics and other States followed closely that definition.
So did the Draft Convention submitted in 1933 by His Majesty’s
Government in the United Kingdom to the Disarmament
Conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, it is unprofitable to elaborate here the details of
the problem or of the definition of aggression. This Tribunal
will not allow itself to be deflected from its purpose by attempts
to ventilate in this Court what is an academic and, in the circumstances,
an utterly unreal controversy as to what is a war of
<span class='pageno' title='610' id='Page_610'></span>
aggression. There is no definition of aggression, general or particular,
which does not cover abundantly and irresistibly and in
every material detail the premeditated onslaught by Germany
upon the territorial integrity and the political independence of
so many States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This then being the law—that the peoples of the world by the
Pact of Paris had finally outlawed war and made it criminal—let
us turn to the facts and see how these Defendants under their
Leader and with their associates destroyed the high hopes of mankind
and sought to revert to international anarchy. And first
in general terms let this be said, for it will be established beyond
doubt by the documents. From the moment Hitler became Chancellor
in 1933, with the Defendant Von Papen as Vice-Chancellor,
and with the Defendant Von Neurath as his Foreign Minister,
the whole atmosphere of the world darkened. The hopes of the
people began to recede. Treaties seemed no longer matters of
solemn obligation, but were entered into with complete cynicism as
a means for deceiving other States of Germany’s warlike intentions.
International Conferences were no longer to be used as
a means for securing pacific settlements but as occasions for obtaining
by blackmail demands which were eventually to be enlarged
by war. The World came to know the War of Nerves, the
diplomacy of the fait accompli, of blackmail and bullying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In October 1933 Hitler told his Cabinet that as the proposed
Disarmament Convention did not concede full equality to Germany,
“It would be necessary to torpedo the Disarmament Conference.
It was out of the question to negotiate: Germany would
leave the Conference and the League”. And on the 21st October
1933 she did so, and by so doing struck a deadly blow at the fabric
of security which had been built up on the basis of the League
Covenant. From that time on the record of their foreign policy
became one of complete disregard of all international obligations
and certainly not least of those solemnly concluded by themselves.
As Hitler had expressly avowed, “Agreements are kept
only so long as they serve a certain purpose” (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>). He
might have added that often the purpose was only to lull an intended
victim into a false sense of security. So patent, indeed,
did this eventually become that to be invited by the Defendant
Ribbentrop to enter into a nonaggression pact with Germany
was almost a sign that Germany intended to attack the state concerned.
Nor was it only the formal treaty which they used and
violated as circumstances made expedient. These Defendants
are charged, too, with breaches of the less formal assurances
which, in accordance with diplomatic usage Germany gave to
<span class='pageno' title='611' id='Page_611'></span>
neighboring states. Today with the advance of science the world
has been afforded means of communication and intercourse
hitherto unknown, and as Hitler himself expressly recognized,
International relations no longer depend upon treaties alone. The
methods of diplomacy change. The Leader of one Nation can
speak to the Government and peoples of another. But though
the methods change the principles of good faith and honesty,
established as the fundamentals of civilized society, both in the
national and the International spheres, remain. It is a long time
since it was said that we are part, one of another. And if today
the different states are more closely connected and thus form
part of a World Society more than ever before, so also more than
ever before is there that need of good faith between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us see further how these Defendants, Ministers and High
Officers of the Nazi Government individually and collectively
comported themselves in these matters.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>PART II</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the early hours of the 1st September 1939 under manufactured
and, in any event, inadequate, pretexts, the armed Forces
of the German Reich invaded Poland along the whole length of
her Frontiers and thus launched upon the world the war which
was to bring down so many of the pillars of our civilization.
It was a breach of the Hague Conventions (<span class='it'>TC-2</span>). It was a
breach of the Treaty of Versailles which had established the
Frontiers between Germany and Poland. And however much
Germany disliked that Treaty—although Hitler had stated that
he would respect its territorial provisions—she was certainly not
free to break it by unilateral action. It was a breach of the Arbitration
Treaty between Germany and Poland concluded at Locarno
on 16th October 1925 (<span class='it'>TC-15</span>). By that Treaty Germany
and Poland expressly agreed to refer any matters of dispute not
capable of settlement by ordinary diplomatic machinery to the
decision of an Arbitral Tribunal or of the Permanent Court of
International Justice. But that is not all. It was also a breach
of a more recent and, in view of the repeated emphasis laid on it
by Hitler himself, a more important engagement into which Nazi
Germany had entered. On the 26th January 1934 the German
and Polish Governments had signed a ten-year Pact of Non-aggression
(<span class='it'>TC-21</span>). It was, as the signatories stated, to introduce
“a new era in the political relations between Poland and
Germany”. It was stated in the text of the Pact itself that “the
maintenance and guarantee of lasting Peace between the two
<span class='pageno' title='612' id='Page_612'></span>
countries is an essential prerequisite for the general peace of
Europe”. The two Governments therefore agreed to base their
mutual relations on the principles laid down in the Pact of Paris
of 1928. They declared that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In no circumstances * * * will they proceed to the application
of force for the purpose of reaching a decision in
such disputes”. (<span class='it'>TC-21</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That declaration and agreement was to remain in force for at
least ten years and thereafter would remain valid unless it was
denounced by either Government six months before the expiration
of the ten years, or subsequently a denunciation, with six
months notice took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both at the time of its signature and during the following four
years Hitler spoke of the German-Polish Agreement publicly as
though it were a cornerstone of his foreign policy. By entering
into it he persuaded many people that his intentions were genuinely
pacific, for the re-emergence of an independent Poland had
cost Germany much territory and had separated East Prussia
from the Reich. That Hitler should of his own accord enter into
friendly relations with Poland; that in his speeches on foreign
policy he should proclaim his recognition of Poland’s right to an
exit to the sea, and the necessity for Germans and Poles to live
side by side in amity—these facts seemed to the world convincing
proof that Hitler had no “revisionist” aims which would threaten
the peace of Europe, and that he was even genuinely anxious to
put an end to the age-old hostility between the Teuton and the
Slav. If his professions were genuine his policy excluded a renewal
of the <span class='it'>Drang nach Osten</span> and thereby would contribute to
the stability of Europe. We shall have occasion enough to see
how little truth these pacific professions contained. The history
of the fateful years from 1934 to 1939 shows quite clearly that
the Germans used this Treaty, as they used other Treaties, merely
as an instrument of policy for furthering their aggressive aims.
It is clear from the documents now presented to the Tribunal
that these five years fall into two distinct phases in the realization
of aggressive aims which always underlay the Nazi policy.
There was first the period from the Nazi assumption of power in
1933 until the autumn of 1937. That was the preparatory period.
During that time there occurred the breaches of the Versailles
and Locarno Treaties, the feverish rearmament of Germany,
the reintroduction of conscription, the reoccupation and
remilitarization of the Rhineland, and all the other necessary
preparatory measures for future aggression with which my
United States colleagues have already so admirably dealt. During
<span class='pageno' title='613' id='Page_613'></span>
that time they lulled Poland into a false sense of security. Not
only Hitler, but also the Defendant Goering and the Defendant
Ribbentrop made statements approbating the Pact. In 1935
Goering was saying that “the pact was not planned for a period
of ten years but forever: there need not be the slightest fear that
it would not be continued.” Even though Germany was steadily
building up the greatest war machine that Europe had ever
known, and although, by January 1937, the German military position
was so secure that Hitler could refer openly to his strong
Army, he took pains also to say at the time that “by a series of
agreements we have eliminated existing tensions and thereby
contributed considerably to an improvement in the European atmosphere.
I merely recall the agreement with Poland which has
worked out to the advantage of both sides. * * *” (<span class='it'>2368-PS</span>).
And so it went on—abroad protestations of pacific intentions—at
home “guns before butter”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1937, however, this preparatory period drew to a close and
Nazi policy moved from general preparation for future aggression
to specific planning for the attainment of certain specific
aggressive aims. Two documents in particular mark this change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first of these was an important “Directive for unified preparation
for War” issued on June 29, 1937, by the Reich-Minister
for War (von Blomberg) and C-in-C of the Armed Forces
(<span class='it'>C-175</span>). This document is important, not only for its military
directions, but for the appreciation it contained of the European
situation and for the revelation it provides of the Nazi attitude
towards it.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The general political position”, von Blomberg stated, “justifies
the supposition that Germany need not consider an attack
from any side. Grounds for this are, in addition to the
lack of desire for war in almost all Nations, particularly the
Western Powers, the deficiencies in the preparedness for war
of a number of States, and of Russia in particular”. (<span class='it'>C-175</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>He added, it is true, “The intention of unleashing an European
War is held just as little by Germany”. And it may be that that
phrase was carefully chosen, for Germany hoped to conquer the
world in detail: to fight on one front at a time, not to unleash a
general European conflict. But, he went on, “the politically fluid
world situation, which does not preclude surprising incidents, demands
a continuous preparedness for war of the German Armed
Forces (<span class='it'>a</span>) to counter attack at any time (yet he had just said
that there was no fear of any attack) and (<span class='it'>b</span>) to enable the military
exploitation of politically favorable opportunities should they
occur”. That phrase is no more than a euphemistic description
<span class='pageno' title='614' id='Page_614'></span>
of aggressive war. It reveals the continued adherence of the
German military leaders to the doctrine that military might, and
if necessary war, should be an instrument of policy—the doctrine
explicitly condemned by the Kellogg Pact, to which Germany had
adhered. The document goes on to set out the general preparations
necessary for a possible war in the mobilization period
1937/1938. The document is evidence at least for this—that the
leaders of the German Armed Forces had it in mind to use the
military strength which they were building up for aggressive purposes.
“No reason”—they say—“to anticipate attack from any
side * * * there is a lack of desire for war”. Yet they prepare
to “exploit militarily favorable opportunities”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still more important as evidence of the transition to planned
aggression is the record of the important conference which Hitler
held at the Reichs Chancellery on November 5, 1937, at which von
Blomberg, Reich Minister for War, von Fritsch, C-in-C of the
Army, Goering, C-in-C of the Luftwaffe, Raeder, C-in-C of the
Navy and von Neurath, then the Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs,
were present. The minutes of that conference have already
been put in evidence (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). I refer to them now to emphasize
those passages which make apparent the ultimate intention
to wage an aggressive war. As will be remembered, the burden
of Hitler’s argument at that conference was that Germany required
more territory in Europe. Austria and Czechoslovakia
were specifically envisaged. But Hitler realized that the process
of conquering these two countries might well bring into operation
the treaty obligations of Great Britain and France. He was prepared
to take the risk.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The history of all times: Roman Empire, British Empire,
has proved that every space expansion can only be effected
by breaking resistance and taking risks. Even setbacks are
unavoidable: neither formerly nor today has space been found
without an owner. The attacker always comes up against
the proprietor. The question for Germany is where the greatest
possible conquest can be made at the lowest possible cost”.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In the course of his address to that Conference Hitler had foreseen
and discussed the likelihood that Poland would be involved
if the aggressive expansionist aims which he put forward brought
about a general European war in the course of their realization
by Germany. When, therefore, on that very day Hitler assured
the Polish Ambassador of the value of the 1934 Pact it can only be
concluded that its real value in Hitler’s eyes was that of keeping
Poland quiet until Germany had acquired such a territorial and
<span class='pageno' title='615' id='Page_615'></span>
strategic position that Poland would no longer be a danger to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That view is confirmed by the events which followed. At the
beginning of February 1938 the change from Nazi preparation
for aggression to active aggression itself took place. It was
marked by the substitution of Ribbentrop for Neurath as Foreign
Minister, and of Keitel for Blomberg as head of OKW. Its first
fruits were the bullying of Schuschnigg at Berchtesgaden on February
12, 1938, and the forcible absorption of Austria in March.
Thereafter the Green Plan (<span class='it'>Fall Gruen</span>) for the destruction of
Czechoslovakia was steadily developed—the plan partially foiled,
or of which the final consummation was at least delayed, by the
Munich Agreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With these developments of Nazi aggression my United States
colleagues have already dealt. But it is obvious that the acquisition
of these two countries, and of their resources in manpower
and in the production of munitions of war, immensely strengthened
the position of Germany as against Poland. It is, therefore,
not surprising that, just as the defendant Goering assured the
Czechoslovak Minister in Berlin, at the time of the Nazi invasion
of Austria that Hitler recognized the validity of the German-Czechoslovak
Arbitration Treaty of 1925, and that Germany had
no designs against Czechoslovakia herself—“I give you my word
of honor” said Goering—so also continued assurances should be
given during 1938 to Poland in order to keep that country from
interfering with the Nazi aggression on Poland’s neighbors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, on the 20th February 1938 on the eve of his invasion of
Austria, Hitler, referring to the fourth anniversary of the Polish
Pact, permitted himself to say this to the Reichstag:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * and so a way to a friendly understanding has been
successfully paved, an understanding which beginning with
Danzig has today succeeded in finally taking the poison out
of the relations between Germany and Poland and transforming
them into a sincere friendly cooperation. Relying on her
friendships, Germany will not leave a stone unturned to save
that ideal which provides the foundation for the task ahead
of us—Peace”. (<span class='it'>2357-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Still more striking are the cordial references to Poland in Hitler’s
speech in the Sportpalast at Berlin on the 26 September 1938.
He then said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The most difficult problem with which I was confronted was
that of our relations with Poland. There was a danger that
Poles and Germans would regard each other as hereditary
enemies. I wanted to prevent this. I know well enough that
I should not have been successful if Poland had had a democratic
<span class='pageno' title='616' id='Page_616'></span>
constitution. For these democracies which indulge in
phrases about peace are the most bloodthirsty war agitators.
In Poland there ruled no democracy, but a man: and with
him I succeeded, in precisely twelve months, in coming to an
agreement which, for ten years in the first instance, entirely
removed the danger of a conflict. We are all convinced that
this agreement will bring lasting pacification. We realize
that here are two peoples which must live together and
neither of which can do away with the other. A people of 33
millions will always strive for an outlet to the sea. A way
for understanding, then, had to be found, and it will be ever
further extended. Certainly things were hard in this area.
* * * But the main fact is that the two Governments, and
all reasonable and clear-sighted persons among the two peoples
and in the two countries, possess the firm will and determination
to improve their relations. It was a real work of
peace, of more worth than all the chattering in the League of
Nations Palace at Geneva”.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus flattery of Poland preceded the annexation of Austria and
renewed flattery of Poland preceded the projected annexation of
Czechoslovakia. The realities behind these outward expressions
of goodwill are clearly revealed in the documents relating to <span class='it'>Fall
Gruen</span>, which are already before the Tribunal. They show Hitler
as fully aware that there was risk of Poland, England and France
being involved in war to prevent the German annexation of
Czechoslovakia, and that this risk though realized was also accepted.
On the 25th August top secret orders to the German
Air Force in regard to the operations to be conducted against England
and France if they intervened pointed out that, as the
French-Czechoslovak Treaty provided for assistance only in the
case of “unprovoked” attack, it would take a day or two for
France and England to decide whether legally the attack was unprovoked
or not. A blitzkrieg accomplishing its aims before effective
intervention became possible was the object to be aimed at.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the same day an Air Force memorandum on future organization
was issued to which was attached a map on which the
Baltic States, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland are all shown
as part of Germany and preparations for expanding the Air Force
“as the Reich grows in area”, as well as dispositions for a two-front
war against France and Russia are discussed (<span class='it'>L-43</span>; <span class='it'>Chart
No. 10</span>). And on the following day von Ribbentrop is being minuted
about the reaction of Poland towards the Czechoslovak problem:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The fact that after the liquidation of the Czech question it
<span class='pageno' title='617' id='Page_617'></span>
will be generally assumed that Poland will be next in turn”
is recognized but, it is stated, “the later this assumption sinks
in, the better”. (<span class='it'>TC-76</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I will pause at the date of the Munich Agreement for a moment
and ask the Tribunal to consider what the evidence of documents
and historical facts shows up to that time. It has made undeniable
the fact both of Nazi aggressiveness and of active aggression.
Not only does the Conference of 1937 reveal Hitler and his associates
deliberately considering the acquisition of Austria and
Czechoslovakia, if necessary by war, but the first of those operations
had been carried through in March 1938 and a large part
of the second, under threat of war, though without actual need
for its initiation, in September of the same year. More ominous
still, Hitler had revealed his adherence to his old doctrines of
<span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, those essentially aggressive to the exposition of
which in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> long regarded as the Bible of the Nazi Party
we shall draw attention. He is in pursuit of <span class='it'>Lebensraum</span> and he
means to secure it by threats of force or, if they fail, by force,
by aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far actual warfare has been avoided because of the love of
peace, the lack of preparedness, the patience or the cowardice—which
you will—of the democratic Powers. But, after Munich,
the questions which filled the minds of all thinking people with
acute anxiety was, “Where will this end? Is Hitler now satisfied,
as he declares he is? Or will his pursuit of <span class='it'>Lebensraum</span> lead to
further aggressions, even if he has to make an openly aggressive
war to secure it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in relation to the remainder of Czechoslovakia and to
Poland that the answer to these questions was to be given. So
far no direct and immediate threat to Poland had been made. The
two documents from which I have just quoted (<span class='it'>L-43</span>; <span class='it'>TC-76</span>)
show that high officers of the defendant Goering’s Air Staff already
regarded the extension of the Reich and, it would appear,
the destruction and absorption of Poland as a foregone conclusion.
They were already anticipating, indeed, the last stage of Hitler’s
policy stated in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, war to destroy France and to secure
<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span> in Russia. And the writer of the Minute to Ribbentrop
already took it for granted that, after Czechoslovakia, Poland
would be attacked. More impressive than these two documents is
the fact that, as I have said, the record of the Conference of November
5, 1937, shows that war with Poland, if she should dare
to attempt to prevent German aggression against Czechoslovakia,
had been coolly contemplated and that the Nazi leaders were ready
to take the risk. So also had the risk of war with England and
<span class='pageno' title='618' id='Page_618'></span>
France under the same circumstances been considered and accepted.
Such a war would, of course, have been an aggressive
war on Nazi Germany’s part. For to force one State to take up
arms to defend another against aggression in order to fulfill
treaty obligations is to initiate aggressive war against the first
State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it remains true that until Munich the decision for direct attack
upon Poland and her destruction by aggressive war had apparently
not as yet been taken by Hitler and his associates. It
is to the transition from the intention and preparation of initiating
an aggressive war, evident in regard to Czechoslovakia, to
the actual initiation and waging of aggressive war against Poland
that I now pass. That transition occupies the eleven months from
October 1, 1938 to the actual attack on Poland on September 1,
1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within six months of the signature of the Munich Agreement
the Nazi Leaders had occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia,
which by that agreement they had indicated their willingness to
guarantee. On March 14th, 1939, the aged and infirm President
of the “Rump” of Czechoslovakia, Hacha, and his Foreign Minister,
Chvalkowsky, were summoned to Berlin. At a meeting
held between 1.15 and 2.15 a. m. in the small hours of the 15th
March in the presence of Hitler and the defendants Ribbentrop,
Goering, and Keitel, they were bullied and threatened and informed
bluntly that Hitler “had issued the order for the German
troops to march into Czechoslovakia, and for the incorporation of
this country into the German Reich”. It was made quite clear
to them that resistance would be useless and would be crushed
“by force of arms with all available means”. It was thus that
the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was set up and that
Slovakia was turned into a German satellite, though nominally
independent, state. By their own unilateral action, on pretexts
which had no shadow of validity, without discussion with
the Governments of any other country, without mediation and in
direct contradiction of the sense and spirit of the Munich Agreement,
the Germans acquired for themselves that for which they
had been planning in September of the previous year, and indeed
much earlier, but which at that time they had felt themselves unable
completely to secure without too patent an exhibition of their
aggressive intentions. Aggression achieved whetted the appetite
for aggression to come. There were protests. England and
France sent diplomatic notes. Of course there were protests. The
Nazis had clearly shown their hand. Hitherto they had concealed
from the outside world that their claims went beyond incorporating
<span class='pageno' title='619' id='Page_619'></span>
into the Reich persons of German Race living in bordering
territory. Now for the first time, in defiance of their own solemn
assurances to the contrary, non-German territory had been seized.
This acquisition of the whole of Czechoslovakia, together with the
equally illegal occupation of Memel on the 22d March, resulted in
an immense strengthening of the German position, both politically
and strategically, as Hitler had anticipated it would when
he discussed the matter at his conference on November 5th, 1937.
(<span class='it'>386-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long before the consummation by the Nazi Leaders of their aggression
against Czechoslovakia, however, they had already begun
to make demands upon Poland. On October 25th, 1938, that
is to say within less than a month of Hitler’s reassuring speech
about Poland already quoted and of the Munich Agreement itself,
M. Lipski, the Polish Ambassador in Berlin, reported to M. Beck,
the Polish Foreign Minister, that at a luncheon at Berchtesgaden
the day before (October 24th) the defendant Ribbentrop had put
forward demands for the reunion of Danzig with the Reich and
for the building of an extra-territorial motor road and railway
line across Pomorze, that is, the province which the Germans
called the Corridor. From that moment onwards until the Polish
Government had made it plain, during a visit of the defendant
Ribbentrop to Warsaw which ended on January 27th, 1939, that
they would not consent to hand over Danzig to German Sovereignty
negotiations on these German demands continued. Even
after Ribbentrop’s return Hitler thought it worth while in his
Reichstag Speech on January 30th, 1939 to say—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We have just celebrated the fifth anniversary of the conclusion
of our nonaggression pact with Poland. There can
scarcely be any difference of opinion today among the true
friends of peace as to the value of this agreement. One only
needs to ask oneself what might have happened to Europe if
this agreement, which brought such relief, had not been entered
into five years ago. In signing it, the great Polish marshal
and patriot rendered his people just as great a service
as the leaders of the National-Socialist State rendered the
German people. During the troubled months of the past
year the friendship between Germany and Poland has been
one of the reassuring factors in the political life of Europe”.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That utterance, however, was the last friendly word from Germany
to Poland and the last occasion upon which the Nazi Leader
mentioned the German-Polish Agreement with approbation. During
February 1939 silence fell upon German demands. But as
soon as the final absorption of Czechoslovakia had taken place,
<span class='pageno' title='620' id='Page_620'></span>
and Germany had also absorbed Memel, Nazi pressure upon Poland
was at once renewed. In two conversations between himself
and the defendant Ribbentrop, held on March 21st and March
26th respectively (Polish White Book Number 61 and Number
63), German demands upon Poland were renewed and further
pressed. In view of the fate which had overtaken Czechoslovakia
and of the grave deterioration in her strategical position towards
Germany it is not surprising that the Polish Government took
alarm at these developments. Nor were they alone in this. The
events of March 1939 had at last convinced both the English and
French Governments that the Nazi designs of aggression were
not limited to men of German race and that the spectre of European
war resulting from further aggressions by Nazi Germany
had not been exorcised by the Munich Agreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result, therefore, of the concern of Poland, England, and
France at the events in Czechoslovakia and at the newly applied
pressure on Poland, conversations between the English and
Polish Governments had been taking place, and, on 31st March,
1939, Mr. Neville Chamberlain, speaking in the House of Commons,
stated that His Majesty’s Government had given an assurance
to help Poland in the event of any action which clearly
threatened Polish independence and which the Polish Government
accordingly considered it vital to resist (<span class='it'>TC-72, No. 17</span>). On
6th April 1939 an Anglo-Polish communique stated that the two
countries were prepared to enter into an Agreement of a permanent
and reciprocal character to replace the present temporary
and unilateral assurance given by His Majesty’s Government.
(<span class='it'>TC-72, No. 18</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The justification for such concern is not difficult to find. With
the evidence which we now have of what was happening within
the councils of the German Reich and its armed forces during
these months it is manifest that the German Government were intent
on seizing Poland as a whole, that Danzig—as Hitler was to
say himself a month later—“was not the subject of the dispute
at all”. The Nazi Government was intent upon aggression and the
demands and negotiations in respect of Danzig were merely a
cover and excuse for further domination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far back as September 1938 plans for aggressive war against
Poland, England, and France were well in hand. While Hitler,
at Munich, was telling the world that the German people wanted
peace and that, having solved the Czechoslovakian problem, Germany
had no more territorial problems in Europe, the staffs of
his armed forces were already preparing plans. On the 26th
September 1938 he had said:
<span class='pageno' title='621' id='Page_621'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We have given guarantees to the States in the West. We
have assured all our immediate neighbours of the integrity
of their territory as far as Germany is concerned. That is
no mere phrase. It is our sacred will. We have no interest
whatever in a breach of the peace. We want nothing from
these peoples.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The world was entitled to rely upon these assurances. International
cooperation is impossible unless one can assume good faith
in the leaders of the various States. But within two months of
that solemn and considered undertaking, Hitler and his confederates
were preparing for the seizure of Danzig. To recognize
these assurances, these pledges, these diplomatic moves as the
empty frauds they were, one must go back to enquire what was
happening within the inner councils of the Reich from the time of
the Munich Agreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Written some time in September 1938 is an extract from a file
on the Reconstruction of the German Navy (<span class='it'>C-23</span>). Under the
heading “Opinion on the Draft Study of Naval Warfare against
England” it is stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. If, according to the Fuehrer’s decision Germany is to
acquire a position as a world power, she needs not only
sufficient colonial possessions but also secure naval communications
and secure access to the ocean.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Both requirements can only be fulfilled in opposition to
Anglo-French interests and would limit their position as
world powers. It is unlikely that they can be achieved by
peaceful means. The decision to make Germany a world
power, therefore, forces upon us the necessity of making the
corresponding preparations for war.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. War against England means at the same time war against
the Empire, against France, probably against Russia as well
and a large number of countries overseas, in fact, against
half to one-third of the world.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It can only be justified and have a chance of success if it is
prepared economically as well as politically and militarily
and waged with the aim of conquering for Germany an outlet
to the ocean.” (<span class='it'>C-23</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here is something which is both significant and new. Until
this date the documents in our possession disclose preparations
for war against Poland, England, and France purporting at least
to be defensive measures to ward off attacks which might result
from the intervention of those powers in the preparatory aggression
of Germany in Central Europe. Hitherto aggressive war
<span class='pageno' title='622' id='Page_622'></span>
against Poland, England, and France has been contemplated only
as a distant objective. Now, for the first time, we find a war of
conquest by Germany against France and England openly recognized
as the future aim, at least of the German Navy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 24th November 1938 an Appendix was issued by Keitel
to a previous order of the Fuehrer. In this Appendix there are
set out the future tasks for the armed forces and the preparation
for the conduct of the war which would result from those tasks.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer has ordered that besides the three eventualities
mentioned in the previous Directive preparations are
also to be made for the surprise occupation by German troops
of the Free State of Danzig.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For the preparation the following principles are to be borne
in mind—the primary assumption is the lightning seizure of
Danzig by exploiting a favorable political situation and not
war with Poland * * *. Troops which are going to be
used for this purpose must not be held at the same time for
the seizure of Memelland, so that both operations can take
place simultaneously should such necessity arise.” (<span class='it'>C-137</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter, as the evidence which has already been produced
has shown, final preparations for the invasion of Poland were
taking place. On the 3d April 1939, three days before the issue
of the Anglo-Polish communique, Keitel issued to the High Command
of the Armed Forces a Directive in which it was stated that
the Directive for the uniform preparation of war by the armed
forces in 1939-40 was being re-issued, and that the part concerning
Danzig would be issued in the middle of April. The basic
principles were to remain the same as in the previous Directive.
Attached to this document were the orders “<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>”, the code
name for the proposed invasion of Poland. Preparations for that
invasion were to be made in such a way that the operation could
be carried out at any time from the 1st September 1939 onwards.
(<span class='it'>C-120</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 11th April Hitler issued his Directive for the uniform
preparations of war by the armed forces 1939-40. In it he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I shall lay down in a later Directive future tasks of the
armed forces and the preparations to be made in accordance
with these for the conduct of war. Until that Directive
comes into force the armed forces must be prepared for the
following eventualities:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Safeguarding of the frontiers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. <span class='it'>“Fall Weiss.”</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The annexation of Danzig.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='623' id='Page_623'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In an Annex to that document headed “Political Hypotheses
and Aims” it is stated that quarrels with Poland should be avoided.
Should Poland, however, change her present policy and adopt a
threatening attitude towards Germany, a final settlement would be
necessary, notwithstanding the pact with Poland. The Free City
of Danzig was to be incorporated into Germany at the outbreak
of the conflict at the latest. The policy aims to limit the war to
Poland and this is considered possible with the internal crisis in
France and resulting British restraint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wording of this document does not directly involve the intention
of immediate aggression. It is a plan of attack “if Poland
changes her policy and adopts a threatening attitude”. But the
picture of Poland, with her inadequate armaments, threatening
Germany is ludicrous enough and the real aim emerges in the
sentence “The aim is then to destroy Polish military strength and
to create, in the East, a situation which satisfies the requirements
of defense”—a sufficiently vague phrase to cover designs of any
magnitude. Even now the evidence does not suffice to prove that
the actual decision to attack Poland has been taken. But all preparations
are being set in train in case that decision is reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was within three weeks of the date of this last document that
Hitler addressed the Reichstag (April 28th, 1939). In his speech
he repeated the German demands already made to Poland and
proceeded to denounce the German-Polish Agreement of 1934.
Leaving aside for the moment the warlike preparations for aggression,
which Hitler had set in train behind the scenes, I will
ask the Tribunal to consider the nature of the denunciation of an
Agreement to which, in the past, Hitler had professed to attach
so high an importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place Hitler’s denunciation was <span class='it'>per se</span> ineffectual,
since the text of the Agreement made no provision for its denunciation
by either Party until six months before the expiration of
the ten years for which it was concluded. No denunciation could
be legally affective, therefore, until June or July 1943, and Hitler
was speaking on April 28th 1939—more than five years too soon!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second place Hitler’s actual attack on Poland when it
came on September 1st, 1939, was made before the expiration of
the six months period after denunciation required by the Agreement
before such a denunciation became operative. In the third
place the grounds for his denunciation of the Agreement stated by
Hitler in his speech to the Reichstag are entirely specious. However
one reads its terms it is impossible to accept the view that
the Anglo-Polish guarantee of mutual assistance against aggression
could render the Pact null and void. If that were so then
<span class='pageno' title='624' id='Page_624'></span>
certainly the Pacts already entered into by Hitler with Italy and
Japan had already invalidated it, and Hitler might have spared
his breath. But the truth is that the text of the German-Polish
Agreement contains nothing whatever to support Hitler’s contention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why then did Hitler make this trebly invalid attempt to denounce
his own pet diplomatic child? Is there any other possible
answer but that, the Agreement having served its purpose, the
grounds which he put forward were chosen merely in an effort to
provide Germany with some justification for the aggression on
which she was intent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Hitler sorely needed some kind of justification, some apparently
decent excuse, since nothing had happened, or was likely
to happen, from the Polish side to provide him with it. So far
he had made demands upon his Treaty partner which Poland, as a
sovereign State had every right to refuse. If dissatisfied with
that refusal Hitler was bound, under the terms of the Agreement
itself, to “seek a settlement through other peaceful means, without
prejudice to the possibility of applying those methods of procedure,
in case of necessity, which are provided for such a case in
the other agreements between them that are in force”—a reference,
it can only be supposed, to the German-Polish Arbitration
Treaty signed at Locarno in 1925.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very fact, therefore, that as soon as the Nazi leader cannot
get what he wants, but is not entitled to, from Poland by merely
asking for it, and that, on his side, he made no further effort to
settle the dispute “by peaceful means” in accordance with the
terms of the Agreement and of the Kellogg Pact, to which the
Agreement pledged both Parties, in itself creates a strong presumption
of aggressive intentions against Hitler and his associates.
That presumption becomes a certainty when the documents
to which I shall now refer are studied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 10th May Hitler issued an order for the capture of economic
installations in Poland and on 16th May the Defendant Raeder,
as Commander in Chief of the Navy, issued a memorandum setting
out the Fuehrer’s instructions to prepare for the operation
“Fall Weiss” at any time from the 1st September 1939. (<span class='it'>C-120</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the decisive document is the record of the Conference held
by Hitler on May 23d, 1939 with various high-ranking officers, including
the defendants Goering, Raeder, and Keitel. Hitler then
stated that the solution of the economic problems could not be
found without invasion of foreign States and attacks on foreign
property.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Danzig is not the subject of the dispute at all: it is a question
<span class='pageno' title='625' id='Page_625'></span>
of expanding our living space in the East * * *.
There is therefore no question of sparing Poland, and we are
left with the decision: to attack Poland at the earliest opportunity.
We cannot expect a repetition of the Czech affair.
There will be war. Our task is to isolate Poland. The success
of this isolation will be decisive. The isolation of Poland
is a matter of skillful politics.” (<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>He anticipated the possibility that war with England and France
might result. But a two-front war was to be avoided if possible.
Yet England was recognized as the most dangerous enemy. “England
is the driving force against Germany * * * the aim
will always be to force England to her knees.” More than once
he repeated that the war with England and France would be a
life and death struggle. All the same, he concluded, “We shall
not be forced into war but we shall not be able to avoid one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 14th June, 1939, General Blaskowitz, then Commander
in Chief of the 3d Army Group, issued a detailed battle plan for
the “<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>” (<span class='it'>2327-PS</span>). The following day Von Brauchitsch
issued a memorandum in which it was stated that the object of
the impending operating was to destroy the Polish Armed Forces.
“High Policy demands”—he said—“that the war should be begun
by heavy surprise blows in order to achieve quick results (<span class='it'>C-126</span>).
The preparations proceeded apace. On the 22d June Keitel submitted
a preliminary timetable for the operation which Hitler
seems to have approved and suggested that the scheduled manouevre
must be camouflaged “in order not to disquiet the population”.
On the 3d July Brauchitsch wrote to Raeder urging that
certain preliminary naval moves should be abandoned in order
not to prejudice the surprise of the attack. On the 12th and 13th
August Hitler and Ribbentrop had a conference with Ciano, the
Italian Foreign Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of the conversation Hitler emphasized the
strength of the German position, of its western and eastern fortifications
and of the strategic and other advantages that they
held in comparison with those of England, France, and Poland.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Since the Poles through their whole attitude had made it
clear that in any case in the event of a conflict they would
stand on the side of the enemies of Germany and Italy, a
quick liquidation at the present moment could only be of advantage
for the unavoidable conflict with the Western democracies.
If a hostile Poland remained on Germany’s Eastern
frontier, not only would the eleven East Prussian divisions
be tied down, but also further contingents would be
kept in Pomerania and Silesia. This would not be necessary
<span class='pageno' title='626' id='Page_626'></span>
in the event of a previous liquidation. Generally speaking,
the best thing to happen would be for the neutrals to be liquidated
one after the other. This process could be carried out
more easily if on every occasion one partner of the Axis covered
the other while it was dealing with an uncertain neutral.
Italy might well regard Yugoslavia as a neutral of this kind.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Ciano was for postponing the operation. Italy was not ready—she
believed that a conflict with Poland would develop into a general
European war. Mussolini was convinced that conflict with the
Western democracies was inevitable but he was making plans for
a period two or three years ahead. But the Fuehrer said that the
Danzig question must be settled one way or the other by the end
of August. “He had, therefore, decided to use the occasion of the
next Polish provocation in the form of an ultimatum.” On the
22d August Hitler called his Supreme Commanders together at
Obersalzburg and gave the order for the attack: in the course of
what he said he made it clear that the decision to attack had in
fact been made not later than the previous spring. He would give
a spurious cause for starting the war (<span class='it'>1014-PS</span>; <span class='it'>L-3</span>). At that
time the attack was timed for the early hours of the 26th August.
On the day before the British Government, in the hope that Hitler
might still be reluctant to plunge the world into war, and in the
belief that a formal treaty would impress him more than the informal
assurances which had been given previously, entered into
an agreement for mutual assistance with Poland, embodying the
previous assurances. It was known to Hitler that France was
bound by the Franco-Polish Treaty of 1921, and by the Guarantee
Pact signed at Locarno in 1925 to intervene in Poland’s aid in
case of aggression. For a moment Hitler hesitated. Goering and
Ribbentrop agree that it was this Anglo-Polish Treaty which led
him to call off, or rather postpone the attack. Perhaps he hoped
that there was still some chance of repeating, after all, what he
had called the Czech affair. If so, his hopes were short-lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 27th August Hitler accepted Mussolini’s decision not at
once to come into the war, but asked for propaganda support and
a display of military activities to create uncertainty in the minds
of the Allies. Ribbentrop on the same day said that the Armies
were marching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, of course, and particularly in the last month,
desperate attempts had been made by the Western Powers to
avert war. You will have details of them in evidence. Of the intervention
of the Pope. Of President Roosevelt’s message. Of
the offer by Mr. Chamberlain to do our utmost to create the conditions
in which all matters in issue could be the subject of free
<span class='pageno' title='627' id='Page_627'></span>
negotiations and to guarantee the resultant decisions. This and
all the other efforts of honest men to avoid the horror of a European
war were predestined to failure. The Germans were determined
that the day for war had come. On the 31st August Hitler
issued a top secret order for the attack to commence in the early
hours of the 1st September. The necessary frontier incidents
duly occurred—was it for these that Keitel had been instructed
by Hitler to supply Heydrich with Polish uniforms?—and thus,
without a declaration of war, without even giving the Polish Government
an opportunity of seeing Germany’s final demands the
Nazi troops invaded Poland. On the 3d September, Hitler sent a
telegram to Mussolini thanking him for his intervention but pointing
out that the war was inevitable and that the most promising
moment had to be picked after cold deliberation (<span class='it'>1831-PS</span>). And
so Hitler and his Confederates now before this Tribunal began the
first of their wars of aggression for which they had prepared so
long and so thoroughly. They waged it so fiercely that within a
few weeks Poland was overrun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 23d November 1939 Hitler reviewed the situation to
his military Commanders and in the course of his speech he said
this:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“One year later Austria came; this step was also considered
doubtful. It brought about a tremendous reinforcement of
the Reich. The next step was Bohemia, Moravia, and Poland.
This step also was not possible to accomplish in one campaign.
First of all the Western fortifications had to be
finished * * *. Then followed the creation of the Protectorate
and with that the basis of action against Poland
was laid. But I wasn’t quite clear at that time whether I
should start first against the East and then in the West or
vice versa. The decision came to fight with Poland first.
One might accuse me of wanting to fight again and again.
In struggle, I see the fate of all human beings.” (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He was not sure when to attack first. But that sooner or
later he would attack was never in doubt, and he had been
warned not only by the British and French Prime Ministers but
even by his confederate Mussolini that an attack on Poland would
bring England and France into the war. He chose what he considered
the opportune moment—and he struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these circumstances the intent to wage war against England
and France, and to precipitate it by an attack on Poland, is not
to be denied. Here was defiance of the most solemn treaty obligations:
here was neglect of the most pacific assurances. Here
was aggression, naked and unashamed, which was indeed to
<span class='pageno' title='628' id='Page_628'></span>
arouse the horrified and heroic resistance of all civilized peoples
but which was to tear down many of the pillars of our civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once started upon the active achievement of their plan to secure
the domination of Europe, if not of the world, the Nazi
Government proceeded to attack other countries, as occasion offered.
The first actually to be invaded after the attack on Poland
were Denmark and Norway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 9th April 1940 the German Armed Forces invaded
Norway and Denmark without warning, without any declaration
of war. It was a breach of the Hague Convention of 1907. It
was a breach of the Convention of Arbitration and Conciliation
between Germany and Denmark dated 2d June, 1926. It was,
of course, a breach of the Briand-Kellogg Pact of 1928. It was a
violation of the Nonaggression Treaty between Germany and
Denmark made on the 31st May 1939. And it was a breach of
the most explicit assurances which had been given. After his
annexation of Czechoslovakia had shaken the confidence of the
world, Hitler attempted to reassure the Scandinavian States. On
the 28th April, 1939, he affirmed that he had never made any
request to them which was incompatible with their sovereignty
and independence. On the 31st May, 1939, he signed a nonaggression
Pact with Denmark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 2d September, the day after he had invaded Poland
and seized Danzig, he again expressed his determination to observe
the inviolability and integrity of Norway in an aide
memoire which was handed to the Norwegian Foreign Minister
by the German Minister in Oslo on that day. (<span class='it'>TC-31</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A month later, on the 6th October 1939, he said in a public
speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany has never had any conflicts of interest or even
points of controversy with the Northern States, neither has
she any today. Sweden and Norway have both been offered
nonaggression pacts by Germany and have both refused them
solely because they do not feel themselves threatened in any
way.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When the invasion of Norway and Denmark had already begun
in the early morning of the 9th April, a German memorandum
was handed to the Governments of those countries attempting to
justify the German action. Various allegations against the Governments
of the invaded countries were made. It was said that
Norway had been guilty of breaches of neutrality. It was said
that she had allowed and tolerated the use of her territorial
waters by Great Britain. It was said that Britain and France
were making plans themselves to invade and occupy Norway
<span class='pageno' title='629' id='Page_629'></span>
and that the Government of that country was prepared to acquiesce
in such an event.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not propose to argue the question whether or not those
allegations were true or false. That question is irrelevant to the
issue before this Court. Even if the allegations were true (and
they were patently false), they would afford no conceivable justification
for the action of invading without warning, without
declaration of war and without any attempt at mediation or conciliation.
Aggressive war is none the less aggressive war because
the State which wages it believes that other states may
take similar action. The rape of a nation is not justified because
it is thought she may be raped by another. Nor even in self-defense
are warlike measures justified except after all means of
mediation have failed and force is actually being exercised against
the State concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In actual fact, with the evidence which we now possess it is
clear that the invasion of these countries was undertaken for
quite different purposes, that it had been planned long before
any question of breach of neutrality or occupation of Norway by
England could ever have occurred. It is clear also that the assurances
repeated again and again throughout the year 1939
were made for no other purpose than to lull suspicion in those
countries and to prevent them taking steps to resist the attack
against them which was under active preparation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some years, Rosenberg, in his capacity of Chief of the
Foreign Affairs Bureau (APA) of the NSDAP, had interested
himself in the promotion of fifth column activities in Norway,
and close relationship was established with the “Nasjonal
Samling”, a political group headed by the now notorious traitor,
Vidkun Quisling (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>). During the winter of 1938/39, APA
was in contact with Quisling and later Quisling conferred with
Hitler, Raeder, and Rosenberg. In August 1939 a special 14
day course was held at the school of the office of Foreign Relations
in Berlin for 25 followers whom Quisling had selected to
attend. The plan was to send a number of selected and “reliable”
men to Germany for a brief military training in an isolated camp.
These were to be area and language specialists to German special
troops who were taken to Oslo on coal barges to undertake political
action in Norway. The object was a coup in which Quisling
would seize his leading opponents in Norway, including the King,
and prevent all military resistance from the beginning. Simultaneously
Germany was making military preparations. On the
2d September, 1939; Hitler had assured Norway of his intention
to respect her neutrality, and on 6th October he said that the
<span class='pageno' title='630' id='Page_630'></span>
Scandinavian States were not menaced in any way, yet on 3d
October 1939 Raeder was pointing out that the occupation of
bases, if necessary by force, would greatly improve the strategic
and economic position (<span class='it'>1546-PS</span>). On the 9th October Doenitz
was recommending Trondheim as the main base with Narvik as
an alternative base for fuel supplies. Rosenberg was reporting
shortly afterwards on the possibility of a coup d’état by Quisling
immediately supported by German military and naval forces.
On the 12th December 1939 Raeder advised Hitler, in the presence
of Keitel and Jodl, that if Hitler was favourably impressed by
Quisling, OKW should prepare for the occupation of Norway,
if possible with Quisling’s assistance, but if necessary entirely
by force. Hitler agreed but there was a doubt whether action
should be taken against the Low Countries or Scandinavia first.
Weather conditions delayed the march against the Low Countries.
In January instructions were given to the Germany Navy for the
attack on Norway, and on March 1st, 1940, a Directive for the
occupation was issued by Hitler. The general objective was not
said to be to prevent occupation by English Forces but in vague
and general terms to prevent British encroachment in Scandinavia
and the Baltic and “to guarantee our ore bases in Sweden
and give our Navy and Air Force a wider start line against
Britain.” But the Directive went on:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * on principle we will do our utmost to make the
operation appear as a peaceful occupation the object of which
is the military protection of the Scandinavian States * * *
it is important that the Scandinavian States as well as the
Western opponents should be taken by surprise by our measures.
* * * In case the preparations for embarkation
can no longer be kept secret the leader and the troops will be
deceived with fictitious objectives.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The form and success of the invasion are well known. In the
early hours of the 9th April 7 cruisers, 14 destroyers, and several
torpedo boats and other small craft carried advance elements of
6 divisions totalling about 10,000 men, forced an entry and landed
troops in the outer Oslo Fjord, Kristiansand, Stavanger, Bergen,
Trondheim, and Narvik. A small number of troops were also
landed at Arendal and Egersund on the southern coast. In addition
airborne troops were landed on aerodromes near Oslo and
Stavanger. The German attack came as a surprise and all the
invaded towns along the coast were captured according to plan
with only slight losses. Only the plan to capture the King and
members of the Government and the Parliament failed. Brave
as the resistance was that was hurriedly organized throughout
<span class='pageno' title='631' id='Page_631'></span>
the country, nothing could be done in the face of the long-planned
surprise attack and on 10 June military resistance ceased. So
was another act of aggression brought to completion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost exactly a month after the attack on Norway, on the
10th May 1940 the German Armed Forces, repeating what had
been done 25 years before, streamed into Belgium, the Netherlands,
and Luxembourg according to plan—the plan that is, of
invading without warning and without declaration of War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was done was of course a breach of the Hague Convention
of 1907, and is so charged. It was a violation of the Locarno
Agreement and Arbitration Convention with Belgium of 1925
which the Nazi Government affirmed in 1935, only illegally to
repudiate it two years later. By that agreement all questions
incapable of settlement by ordinary diplomatic means were to
be settled by arbitration. You will see the comprehensive terms
of these agreements. It was a breach of the Treaty of Arbitration
and Conciliation signed between Germany and the Netherlands
on the 20th May 1926; it was a violation of the similar
Treaty with Luxembourg on the 11th September 1929. It was a
breach of the Briand-Kellogg Pact. But those Treaties had not
perhaps derived in the minds of the Nazi Rulers of Germany
any added sanctity from the fact that they had been solemnly
concluded by the Governments of pre-Nazi Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us consider the specific assurances and undertakings which
the Nazi Rulers themselves gave to the States which lay in the
way of their plans against France and England and which they
always intended to attack. Not once, not twice, but eleven times
the clearest assurances were given to Belgium, the Netherlands,
and Luxembourg. On those assurances solemnly and formally
expressed, those countries were entitled to rely. In respect of
their breach these Defendants are charged. On the 30th January,
1937 Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As for the rest, I have more than once expressed the desire
and the hope of entering into similar good and cordial
relations with our neighbours. Germany has, and here I
repeat this solemnly, given the assurance time and time again,
that, for instance, between her and France there cannot be
any humanly conceivable points of controversy. The German
Government has further given the assurance to Belgium
and Holland that it is prepared to recognize and to
guarantee the inviolability and neutrality of these territories.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After Hitler had remilitarized the Rhineland and had repudiated
the Locarno Pact, England and France sought to reestablish
<span class='pageno' title='632' id='Page_632'></span>
the position of security for Belgium which Hitler’s action had
threatened. They, therefore, themselves gave to Belgium on the
24th April 1937, a specific guarantee that they would maintain
in respect of Belgium, undertakings of assistance which they
had entered into with her both under the Locarno Pact and the
Covenant of the League of Nations. On the 13th October 1937
the German Government also made a declaration assuring Belgium
of its intention to recognize the inviolability and integrity
of that country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, perhaps, convenient to deal with the remaining assurances
as we review the evidence which is available as to the
preparations and intentions of the German Government prior to
their invasion of Belgium on the 10th May 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in the case of Poland, as in the case of Norway and Denmark,
so also here the dates speak for themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As early as August 1938 steps were being made to utilize the
Low Countries as defense bases for decisive action in the West
in the event of France and England opposing Germany in its
aggression upon Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an air force letter dated 25th August 1938 which deals with
the action to be taken if England and France should interfere in
the operation against Czechoslovakia, it is stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is not expected for the moment that other States will
intervene against Germany. The Dutch and the Belgian
area assumes in this connection much more importance for
the prevention of the war in Western Europe than during the
world war. This mainly is an advance base for the air war.”
(<span class='it'>375-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the last paragraph of that order it is stated “Belgium and
the Netherlands when in German hands represent an extraordinary
advantage in the prosecution of the air war against Great
Britain as well as against France.” (<span class='it'>375-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was in August 1938. Eight months later (on the 28th
April 1939) Hitler is declaring again, “I was pleased that a number
of European states availed themselves of this declaration by
the German Government to express and emphasize their desire
to have absolute neutrality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A month later, on the 23d May, 1939, Hitler held the conference
in the Reich Chancellery, to which we have already referred.
The Minutes of that meeting report Hitler as saying:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied by armed
force. Declarations of neutrality must be ignored. If England
and France enter the war between Germany and Poland
they will support Holland and Belgium in their neutrality.
<span class='pageno' title='633' id='Page_633'></span>
* * * Therefore, if England intends to intervene in the
Polish war, we must occupy Holland with lightning speed.
We must aim at securing new defense lines on Dutch soil up
to the Zuyder Zee”. (<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Even after that he was to give his solemn declarations that
he would observe Belgian neutrality. On the 26th August 1939
when the crisis in regard to Danzig and Poland was reaching its
climax, declarations assuring the Governments concerned of the
intention to respect their neutrality were handed by the German
Ambassadors to the King of the Belgians, the Queen of the
Netherlands, and to the Government of the Grand-Duchy of
Luxembourg in the most solemn form. But to the Army—“If
Holland and Belgium are successfully occupied and held”—it was
said—“a successful war against England will be secured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 1st September Poland was invaded, and two days later
England and France came into the War against Germany in pursuance
of the treaty obligation already referred to. On the 6th
October Hitler renewed his assurances of friendship to Belgium
and Holland. But on the 9th October, before any kind of accusation
had been made by the German Government of breaches of
neutrality by Belgium, the Netherlands, or Luxembourg, Hitler
issued a directive for the conduct of the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that directive he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. If it becomes evident in the near future that England
and France acting under her leadership, are not disposed
to end the war, I am determined to take firm and offensive
action without letting much time elapse.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. A long waiting period results not only in the ending of
the advantage to the Western Powers, of Belgium and perhaps
also of Dutch neutrality, but also strengthens the military
power of our enemies to an increasing degree, causes
confidence of the neutrals in German final victory to wane,
and does not help to bring Italy to our aid as brothers-in-arms.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. I therefore issue the following orders for the further
conduct of military operations:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>a</span>) Preparations should be made for offensive action on
the Northern flank of the Western front crossing the area of
Luxembourg, Belgium and Holland. This attack must be
carried out as soon and as forcefully as possible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>b</span>) The object of this attack is to defeat as many strong
sections of the French Fighting Army as possible, and her
ally and partner in the fighting, and at the same time to
acquire as great an area of Holland, Belgium and Northern
<span class='pageno' title='634' id='Page_634'></span>
France as possible, to use as a base offering good prospects
for waging aerial and sea warfare against England and to
provide ample coverage for the vital district of the Ruhr.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing could state more clearly or more definitely the object
behind the invasion of these countries than that document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 15th October 1939 Keitel wrote a most secret letter concerning
<span class='it'>Fall Gelb</span>, which was the code name for the operation
against the Low Countries. In it he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The protection of the Ruhr area by moving A/C reporting
service and the air defense as far forward as possible in the
area of Holland is significant for the whole conduct of the
war. The more Dutch territory we occupy the more effective
can the defense of the Ruhr area be made. This point of
view must determine the choice of objectives of the army
even if the army and navy are not directly interested in such
territorial gain. It must be the object of the army’s preparations,
therefore, to occupy on receipt of a special order the
territory of Holland in the first instance in the area of the
Grebbe-Marse line. It will depend on the military and political
attitude of the Dutch as well as on the effectiveness of
their flooding, whether objects can and must be further extended.”
(<span class='it'>C-62</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The operation had apparently been planned to take place at
the beginning of November. We have in our possession a series
of 17 letters dated from 7th November until the 9th May postponing
almost from day to day the D-day of the operation, so
that by the beginning of November all the major plans and preparations
had been made. (<span class='it'>C-72</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 10th January 1940 a German aeroplane force landed
in Belgium. In it was found the remains of a half-burnt operation
order setting out considerable details of the Belgian landing
grounds that were to be captured (<span class='it'>TC-58</span>). Many other documents
have been found which illustrate the planning and preparation
for this invasion in the latter half of 1939 and early 1940,
but they carry the matter no further, and they show no more
clearly than the evidence to which I have already referred, the
plans and intention of the German Governments and its armed
forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 10th May 1940 at about 0500 hours in the morning the
German invasion of Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more the forces of aggression marched on. Treaties, assurances,
the rights of Sovereign States meant nothing. Brutal
force, covered by as great an element of surprise as the Nazis
could secure, was to seize that which was deemed necessary for
<span class='pageno' title='635' id='Page_635'></span>
striking the mortal blow against England, the main Enemy. The
only fault of these unhappy countries was that they stood in the
path of the German invader. But that was enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 6th April 1941 German armed forces invaded Greece
and Yugoslavia. Again the blow was struck without warning
and with the cowardice and deceit which the World now fully
expected from the self-styled “<span class='it'>Herrenvolk</span>”. It was a breach of
the Hague Convention of 1899. It was a breach of the Pact of
Paris of 1928. It was a breach of a specific assurance given by
Hitler on the 6th October 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Immediately after the completion of the Anschluss”, he said,
“I informed Yugoslavia that, from now on, the frontier with this
country will also be an unalterable one and that we only desire to
live in Peace and Friendship with her”. (<span class='it'>TC-43</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the plan for aggression against Yugoslavia had, of course,
been in hand well before that. In the aggressive action eastward
towards the Ukraine and the Soviet territories security of the
Southern flank and the lines of communication had already been
considered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history of events leading up to the invasion of Yugoslavia
by Germany is well known. At 3 o’clock on the morning of the
28th October 1940 a 3-hour ultimatum had been presented by the
Italian Government to the Greek Government and the presentation
of this ultimatum was followed by the aerial bombardment
of Greek provincial towns and the advance of Italian troops into
Greek territory. The Greeks, not prepared for such an assault,
were at first forced to withdraw. Later the Italian advance was
first checked, then driven towards the Albanian frontier, and by
the end of 1940 the Italian Army had suffered severe reverses at
Greek hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of German intentions there is the evidence of what occurred
when, on 12th August 1939, Hitler held his meeting with Ciano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will remember Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Generally speaking, the best thing to happen would be for
the neutrals to be liquidated one after the other. This process
could be carried out more easily if on every occasion one
partner of the Axis covered the other while it was dealing
with an uncertain neutral. Italy might well regard Yugoslavia
as a neutral of this kind.” (<span class='it'>TC-77</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Later again on the second day of the conversation, 13th August,
he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In general, however, from success by one of the Axis partners
not only strategical but also psychological strengthening
of the other partner and also of the whole Axis would ensue.
<span class='pageno' title='636' id='Page_636'></span>
Italy carried through a number of successful operations in
Abyssinia, Spain and Albania and each time against the
wishes of the Democratic Entente. These individual actions
have not only strengthened Italian local interests but have
also reinforced her general position. The same was the case
with German action in Austria and Czechoslovakia. * * *
The strengthening of the Axis by these individual operations
was of the greatest importance for the unavoidable clash
with the Western Powers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Once again we see the same procedure being followed. That
meeting had taken place on the 12/13th August, 1939. Less than
two months later, on 6 October 1939 Hitler was giving his assurance
to Yugoslavia that Germany only desired to live in peace and
friendship with the Yugoslav State, the liquidation of which by
his Axis partner he had himself suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 28th October 1940 the Italians presented a 3 hour ultimatum
to Greece and commenced war against her. Eventually
the advance was checked, then driven back, and the Italians suffered
considerable reverses at Greek hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have an undated letter from Hitler to Mussolini which must
have been written about the time of the Italian aggression against
Greece. (<span class='it'>2762-PS</span>)</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Permit me at the beginning of this letter to assure you that
within the last 14 days my heart and my thoughts have been
more than ever with you. Moreover, Duce, be assured of my
determination to do everything on your behalf which might
ease the present situation for you. * * * When I asked
you to receive me in Florence, I undertook the trip in the
hope of being able to express my views prior to the beginning
of the threatening conflict with Greece, about which I had
only received general information. First, I wanted to request
you to postpone the action, if possible until a more favorable
time of year, at all events, however, until after the American
presidential election. But in any case, however, I wanted to
request you, Duce, not to undertake this action without a
previous lightning-like occupation of Crete and, for this purpose,
I also wanted to submit to you some practical suggestions
in regard to the employment of a German parachute
division and a further airborne division. * * * Yugoslavia
must become disinterested, if possible, however from
our point of view interested in cooperating in the liquidation
of the Greek question. Without assurances from Yugoslavia,
it is useless to risk any successful operation in the Balkans.
* * * Unfortunately I must stress the fact that waging
<span class='pageno' title='637' id='Page_637'></span>
war in the Balkans before March is impossible. Hence it
would also serve to make any threatening influence upon
Yugoslavia of no purpose, since the Serbian General Staff is
well aware of the fact that no practical action could follow
such a threat before March. Here Yugoslavia must, if at all
possible, be won over by other means and other ways.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the 12th November in his Top Secret Order No. 18 Hitler
ordered the OKH to make preparations to occupy Greece and Bulgaria
if necessary. Approximately 10 divisions were to be used
in order to prevent Turkish intervention. To shorten the time
the German divisions in Rumania were to be increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 13th December 1940 Hitler issued an order to OKW,
OKL, OKH, OKM and General Staff on the operation Marita,
which was the invasion of Greece. In that order it is stated that
the invasion of Greece is planned and is to commence as soon as
the weather becomes advantageous. Further orders were issued
on the 13th December and 11th January. (<span class='it'>448-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1541-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 28th January Hitler saw Mussolini. Jodl, Keitel, and
Ribbentrop were present at the meeting and it is from Jodl’s notes
of what took place that we know that Hitler stated that one of
the purposes of German troop concentrations in Rumania was for
use in his plan for the operation against Greece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 1st March 1941 German troops entered Bulgaria and
moved towards the Greek frontier. In the face of this threat of
an attack on Greece by German as well as Italian forces British
forces were landed in Greece on the 3d March in accordance with
the declaration which had been given by the British Government
on the 13th April 1939 that Great Britain would feel bound to
give Greece and Rumania respectively all the support in her power
in the event of either country becoming the victim of aggression
and resisting such aggression. Already the Italian aggression
had made this pledge operative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 25th March 1941 Yugoslavia joined the 3-Power Pact
which had already been signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan. The
preamble of the Pact stated that the 3 Powers would stand side
by side and work together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the same day Ribbentrop wrote two notes to the Yugoslav
Prime Minister; assuring him of Germany’s full intention to respect
the sovereignty and independence of his country. That
declaration was yet another example of the treachery employed
by German diplomacy. We have seen already the preparations
that had been made. We have seen Hitler’s efforts to tempt the
Italians into an aggression against Yugoslavia. We have seen in
January his orders for his own preparation to invade Yugoslavia
<span class='pageno' title='638' id='Page_638'></span>
and Greece and now on the 25th March he is signing a pact with
that country and his Foreign Minister is writing assurances of
respect for her sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of the signing of that Pact the anti-Nazi element
in Yugoslavia immediately accomplished a coup d’état and established
a new Government. Thereupon the decision was taken to
invade immediately and on the 27th March, two days after the
3-Power Pact had been signed by Yugoslavia, Hitler issued instructions
that Yugoslavia was to be invaded and used as a base
for the continuance of the combined German and Italian offensive
against Greece. (<span class='it'>C-127</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following this, further deployment and other instructions for
the action Marita were issued by Von Brauchitsch on the 30th
March 1941. (<span class='it'>R-95</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is stated that “the orders issued with regard to the operation
against Greece remain valid so far as not affected by this order.
On the 5th April, weather permitting, the Air Forces are to attack
troops in Yugoslavia, while simultaneously the attack of the
12th Army begins against both Yugoslavia and Greece” (<span class='it'>R-95</span>).
As we now know, the invasion actually commenced in the early
hours of the 6th April.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Treaties, Pacts, Assurances—obligations of any kind—are
brushed aside and ignored wherever the aggressive interests of
Germany are concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turn now to the last act of aggression in Europe with which
these Nazi conspirators are charged—the attack upon Russia. In
August 1939 Germany although undoubtedly intending to attack
Russia at some convenient opportunity, sufficiently deceived the
Russian Government to secure a pact of nonaggression between
them. It followed, therefore, that when Belgium and the Low
Countries were occupied and France collapsed in June 1940, England—although
with the inestimably valuable moral and economic
support of the United States of America—was left alone as the sole
representative of Democracy in the face of the forces of aggression.
Only the British Empire stood between Germany and the
achievement of her aim to dominate the Western world. Only the
British Empire—only England as its citadel. But it was enough.
The first, and possibly the decisive, military defeat which the
enemy sustained was in the campaign against England, and that
defeat had a profound influence on the future course of the war.
On the 16th July 1940 Hitler issued to Keitel and Jodl a Directive
for the invasion of England. It started off by stating—and Englishmen
will be forever proud of it—that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Since England, despite her militarily hopeless situation,
shows no signs of willingness to come to terms, I have decided
to prepare a landing operation against England and if
<span class='pageno' title='639' id='Page_639'></span>
necessary to carry it out. The aim is * * * to eliminate
the English homeland as a base for the carrying on of the
war against Germany. The preparations for the entire operation
must be completed by mid-August.” (<span class='it'>442-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But the first essential condition for that plan was “that the
English Air Force must morally and actually be so far overcome
that it does not any longer show any considerable aggressive force
against the German attack.” (<span class='it'>442-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Air Force made the most strenuous efforts to realize
that condition, but, in one of the most splendid pages of our
history, it was decisively defeated. And although the bombardment
of England’s towns and villages was continued throughout
that dark winter of 1940-41 the enemy decided in the end that
England was not to be subjugated by these means, and accordingly
Germany turned back to the East, the first major aim
achieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 22d June 1941, German Armed Forces invaded Russia—without
warning, without declaration of war. It was a breach of
the Hague Conventions; it was a violation of the Pact of Paris of
1928: it was in flagrant contradiction of the Treaty of nonaggression
which Germany and Russia had signed on the 23d August
1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that Treaty, perhaps more blatantly than any other, was
made without any intention of being observed and only for the
purpose of assisting the German Government to carry out their
aggressive plans against the Western democracies before eventually
turning east in their own good time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler himself in referring to the Agreement said agreements
were only to be kept as long as they served a purpose. Ribbentrop
was more explicit. In an interview with the Japanese Ambassador
in Berlin on 23d February 1941 he made it clear that the
object of the Agreement had merely been to avoid a two-front
war. (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In contrast to what Hitler and Ribbentrop were planning within
the councils of Germany, we know what they were saying to the
rest of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 19th July Hitler spoke in the Reichstag:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In these circumstances I consider it proper to negotiate as
a first priority a sober definition of interests with Russia. It
would be made clear once and for all what Germany believes
she must regard as her sphere of interest to safeguard her
future and, on the other hand, what Russia considers important
for her existence.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“From the clear delineation of the sphere of interest on either
<span class='pageno' title='640' id='Page_640'></span>
side, there followed the new regulation of Russo-German relations.
Any hope that now at the end of the term of the
agreement a new Russo-German tension could arise is childish.
Germany has taken no step which would lead her outside
her sphere of interest, nor has Russia. But England’s
hope, to achieve an amelioration of her own position through
the engineering of some new European crisis, is, in so far as
it is concerned with Russo-German relations, an illusion.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“British statesmen perceive everything somewhat slowly, but
they too will learn to understand this in course of time.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it was not many months after that that the arrangements
for attacking Russia were put in hand. Raeder gives us the probable
reasons for this sudden decision in a note to Admiral Assmann.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The fear that control of the air over the Channel in the
Autumn of 1940 could no longer be attained, a realization
which the Fuehrer no doubt gained earlier than the Naval
War Staff, who were not so fully informed of the true results
of air raids on England (our own losses), surely caused the
Fuehrer, as far back as August and September, to consider
whether, even prior to victory in the West, an Eastern campaign
would be feasible with the object of first eliminating
our last serious opponent on the continent. The Fuehrer did
not openly express this fear, however, until well into September.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He may not have told the Navy of his intentions until later in
September, but by the beginning of that month he had undoubtedly
spoken of them to Jodl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dated 6th September 1940 we have a directive of the OKW
signed by Jodl: “Directions are given for the occupation forces
in the east to be increased in the following weeks. For security
reasons this should not create the impression in Russia that Germany
is preparing for an Eastern offensive.” Directives are given
to the German Intelligence Service pertaining to the answering
of questions by the Russian Intelligence Service. “The total
strength of the German troops in the East to be camouflaged by
frequent changes in this area. The impression is to be created
that the bulk of the troops in the south have moved whilst the
occupation in the north is only very small.” (<span class='it'>1229-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus we see the beginning of the operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 12th November 1940 Hitler issued a directive signed by
Jodl in which he stated that the political task to determine the
attitude of Russia had begun, but without reference to the result
<span class='pageno' title='641' id='Page_641'></span>
of preparations against the East, which had been ordered orally
before it could be carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the same day Molotov visited Berlin. At the conclusion of
conversations between himself and the German Government a
communique was issued in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The exchange of ideas took place in an atmosphere of mutual
trust and led to a mutual understanding on all important
questions interesting Germany and the Soviet Union.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is not to be supposed that the USSR would have taken part
in those conversations or agreed to that communique if it had
been realized that on the very day orders were being given for
preparations to be made for the invasion of Russia and that the
order for the operation “Barbarossa” was in preparation. Four
days later that order was issued—“The German armed forces
have to be ready to defeat Soviet Russia in a swift campaign
before the end of the War against Great Britain” (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>).
And later in the same instruction,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“All orders which shall be issued by the High Commanders
in accordance with this instruction have to be clothed in
such terms that they may be taken as measures of precaution
in case Russia should change her present attitude towards
ourselves.” (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Keeping up the pretense of friendliness, on the 10th January,
1941—after the Plan Barbarossa for the invasion of Russia
had been decided upon—the German-Russo frontier treaty was
signed. On the 3d February 1941 Hitler held a conference, attended
by Keitel and Jodl, at which it was provided that the whole
operation was to be camouflaged as if it was part of the preparations
for the “Seelowe” as the plan for invasion of England was
called. By March 1941 the plans were sufficiently advanced to
include provision for dividing the Russian territory into 9 separate
States to be administered under Reich Commissars under the
general control of Rosenberg. At the same time detailed plans
for the economic exploitation of the country were made under
the supervision of Goering, to whom the responsibility was delegated
by Hitler. You will hear something of the details of these
plans. It is significant that on the 2d May 1941 a conference of
the State Secretaries on the Plan Barbarossa noted:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The war can only be continued if all armed forces are
fed out of Russia in the third year of the war.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. There is no doubt that as a result many millions of
people will be starved to death if we take out of the country
the things necessary for us.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='642' id='Page_642'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But this apparently created no concern. The plan Oldenberg,
as the scheme for economic organization was called, went on. By
the 1st May the D date of the operation was fixed. By the 1st
June preparations were virtually complete and an elaborate time
table was issued. It was estimated that although there would be
heavy frontier battles, lasting perhaps 4 weeks, after that no
serious opposition was to be expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 22d June at 3.30 in the morning the German Armies
marched again. As Hitler said in his Proclamation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have decided to give the fate of the German People and
of the Reich and of Europe again into the hands of our
soldiers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The usual false pretexts were of course given. Ribbentrop
stated on the 28th June that the step was taken because of the
threatening of the German frontiers by the Red Army. It was
untrue and Ribbentrop knew it was untrue. On the 7th June
his Ambassador in Moscow was reporting to him that “All observations
show that Stalin and Molotov who are alone responsible
for Russian foreign policy are doing everything to avoid a conflict
with Germany”. The staff records which you will see make
it clear that the Russians were making no military preparations
and that they were continuing their deliveries under the Trade
Agreement to the very last day. The truth was, of course, that
the elimination of Russia as a political opponent and the incorporation
of the Russian territory in the German <span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>
had long been one of the cardinal features of Nazi policy, subordinated
latterly for what Jodl called diplomatic reasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, on the 22d June, the Nazi armies were flung against the
Power with which Hitler had so recently sworn friendship and
Germany embarked on that last act of aggression which, after
long and bitter fighting, was eventually to result in Germany’s
own collapse.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>PART III</p>

<p class='pindent'>This then is the case against these Defendants, as amongst
the rulers of Germany, under Count 2 of this Indictment. It
may be said that many of the documents which have been referred
to were in Hitler’s name, that the orders were Hitler’s
orders, that these men were mere instruments of Hitler’s will.
But they were the instruments without which Hitler’s will could
not be carried out. And they were more than that. These men
were no mere willing tools, although they would be guilty enough
if that had been their role. They are the men whose support
<span class='pageno' title='643' id='Page_643'></span>
had built Hitler up into the position of power he occupied: they
are the men whose initiative and planning perhaps conceived
and certainly made possible the acts of aggression made in Hitler’s
name, and they are the men who enabled Hitler to build up
the Army, Navy and Air Force by which these treacherous attacks
were carried out, and to lead his fanatical followers into
peaceful countries to murder, to loot and to destroy. They are
the men whose cooperation and support made the Nazi Government
of Germany possible. The Government of a totalitarian
country may be carried on without the assistance of representatives
of the people. But it cannot be carried on without any
assistance at all. It is no use having a leader unless there are
also people willing and ready to serve their personal greed and
ambition by helping and following him. The dictator who is set
up in control of the destinies of his country does not depend upon
himself alone either in acquiring power or in maintaining it. He
depends upon the support and backing which lesser men, themselves
lusting to share in dictatorial power, anxious to bask in the
adulation of their leader, are prepared to give. In the Criminal
Courts, where men are put upon their trial for breaches of the
municipal laws, it not infrequently happens that of a gang indicted
together in the Dock, one has the master mind, the leading
personality. But it is no excuse for the common thief to say “I
stole because I was told to steal”; for the murderer to plead “I
killed because I was asked to kill”. These men are in no different
position for all that it was nations they sought to rob, whole peoples
they tried to kill. “The warrant of no man excuseth the
doing of an illegal act.” Political loyalty, military obedience are
excellent things. But they neither require nor do they justify the
commission of patently wicked acts. There comes a point where
a man must refuse to answer to his leader if he is also to answer
to his conscience. Even the common soldier, serving in the ranks
of his Army is not called upon to obey illegal orders. But these
men were no common soldiers: they were the men whose skill
and cunning, whose labour and activity made it possible for the
German Reich to tear up existing treaties, to enter into new ones
and to flout them, to reduce international negotiations and diplomacy
to a hollow mockery, to destroy all respect for and effect
in International Law and finally to march against the peoples of
the world to secure that domination in which as arrogant members
of their self-styled master race they professed their belief.
If the crimes were in one sense the crimes of Nazi Germany, they
also are guilty as the individuals who aided, abetted, counselled,
procured and made possible the commission of what was done.
<span class='pageno' title='644' id='Page_644'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The sum total of the crime these men have committed—so
awful in its comprehension—has many aspects. Their lust and
sadism, their deliberate slaughter and the degradation of so many
millions of their fellow creatures that the imagination reels incomprehensively,
are but one side only of this matter. Now that
an end has been put to this nightmare and we come to consider
how the future is to be lived, perhaps their guilt as murderers
and robbers is of less importance and of less effect to future generations
of mankind than their crime of fraud—the fraud by
which they placed themselves in a position to do their murder
and their robbery. This is the other aspect of their guilt. The
story of their “diplomacy”, founded upon cunning, hypocrisy and
bad faith, is a story less gruesome but no less evil and deliberate.
And should it be taken as a precedent of behaviour in the conduct
of international relations, its consequences to mankind will no
less certainly lead to the end of civilized society. Without trust
and confidence between Nations, without the faith that what is
said is meant and what is undertaken will be observed, all hope
of peace and of security is dead. The Governments of the United
Kingdom and the British Commonwealth, of the USA, of the
USSR, and of France, backed by and on behalf of every other
peace-loving Nation of the world, have therefore joined to bring
the inventors and perpetrators of this Nazi conception of international
relationship before the bar of this Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They do so that these Defendants may be punished for their
crimes. They do so also that their conduct may be exposed in its
naked wickedness. And they do so in the hope that the conscience
and good sense of all the world will see the consequences of such
conduct and the end to which inevitably it must always lead. Let
us once again restore sanity and with it also the sanctity of our
obligations towards each other.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg644a'>6. AGGRESSION AS A BASIC NAZI IDEA: MEIN KAMPF</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, which became the Nazi statement of
faith, gave to the conspirators adequate foreknowledge of the unlawful
aims of the Nazi leadership. It was not only Hitler’s
political testament; by adoption it became theirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> may be described as the blueprint of the Nazi
aggression. Its whole tenor and content demonstrate that the
Nazi pursuit of aggressive designs was no mere accident arising
out of an immediate political situation in Europe and the world.
<span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> establishes unequivocally that the use of aggressive
war to serve German aims in foreign policy was part of the very
creed of the Nazi party.
<span class='pageno' title='645' id='Page_645'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A great German philosopher once said that ideas have hands
and feet. It became the deliberate aim of the conspirators to see
to it that the idea, doctrines, and policies of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> should
become the active faith and guide for action of the German nation,
and particularly of its malleable youth. From 1933 to 1939
an extensive indoctrination in the ideas of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> was
pursued in the schools and universities of Germany, as well as
in the Hitler Youth, under the direction of Baldur von Schirach,
and in the SA and SS, and amongst the German population as a
whole, by the agency of Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A copy of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> was officially presented by the Nazis to
all newly married couples in Germany. [A copy of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>
(<span class='it'>D-660</span>) submitted by the prosecution to the tribunal contains the
following dedication on the fly-leaf:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“To the newly married couple, Friedrich Rosebrock and Else
Geborene Zum Beck, with best wishes for a happy and blessed
marriage. Presented by the Communal Administration on
the occasion of their marriage on the 14th of November,
1940. For the Mayor, the Registrar.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This copy of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, which was the 1945 edition, contains
the information that the number of copies published to date
amount to 6,250,000.]</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of the efforts of the conspirators, this book, blasphemously
called “The Bible of the German people,” poisoned a
generation and distorted the outlook of a whole people. For as
the SS General von dem Bach-Zelewski testified before the Tribunal,
[on 7 January 1946] if it is preached for years, as long
as ten years, that the Slav peoples are inferior races and that
the Jews are subhuman, then it must logically follow that the
killing of millions of these human beings is accepted as a natural
phenomenon. From <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> the way leads directly to the
furnaces of Auschwitz and the gas chambers of Maidanek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What the commandments of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> were may be indicated
by quotations from the book which fall into two main categories.
The first category is that of general expression of Hitler’s
belief in the necessity of force as the means of solving international
problems. The second category is that of Hitler’s more
explicit declarations on the policy which Germany should pursue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the quotations in the second category come from the
last three chapters—13, 14, and 15—of Part II of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>,
in which Hitler’s views on foreign policy were expounded. The
significance of this may be grasped from the fact that Part II
of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> was first published in 1927, less than two years
after the Locarno Pact and within a few months of Germany’s
<span class='pageno' title='646' id='Page_646'></span>
entry into the League of Nations. The date of the publication of
these passages, therefore, brands them as a repudiation of the
policy of international cooperation embarked upon by Stresseman,
and as a deliberate defiance of the attempt to establish, through
the League of Nations, the rule of law in international affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following are quotations showing the general view held
by Hitler and accepted and propagated by the conspirators concerning
war and aggression generally. On page 556 of <span class='it'>Mein
Kampf</span>, Hitler wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The soil on which we now live was not a gift bestowed by
Heaven on our forefathers. But they had to conquer it by
risking their lives. So also in the future our people will not
obtain territory, and therewith the means of existence, as
a favour from any other people, but will have to win it by
the power of a triumphant sword.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On page 145, Hitler revealed his own personal attitude toward
war. Of the years of peace before 1914 he wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Thus I used to think it an ill-deserved stroke of bad luck
that I had arrived too late on this terrestrial globe, and I felt
chagrined at the idea that my life would have to run its
course along peaceful and orderly lines. As a boy I was
anything but a pacifist and all attempts to make me so turned
out futile.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On page 162 Hitler wrote of war in these words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In regard to the part played by humane feeling, Moltke
stated that in time of war the essential thing is to get a
decision as quickly as possible and that the most ruthless
methods of fighting are at the same time the most humane.
When people attempt to answer this reasoning by highfalutin
talk about aesthetics, etc., only one answer can be given. It
is that the vital questions involved in the struggle of a
nation for its existence must not be subordinated to any
aesthetic considerations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s assumption of an inevitable law of struggle for survival
is linked up in Chapter II of Book I of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, with
the doctrine of Aryan superiority over other races and the right
of Germans in virtue of this superiority to dominate and use
other peoples for their own ends. The whole of Chapter II of
<span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> is dedicated to this “master race” theory and, indeed,
many of the later speeches of Hitler were mainly repetitive
of Chapter II.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On page 256, the following sentiments appear:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Had it not been possible for them to employ members of
the inferior race which they conquered, the Aryans would
<span class='pageno' title='647' id='Page_647'></span>
never have been in a position to take the first steps on the
road which led them to a later type of culture; just as,
without the help of certain suitable animals which they were
able to tame, they would never have come to the invention of
mechanical power, which has subsequently enabled them to
do without these beasts. For the establishment of superior
types of civilization the members of inferior races formed
one of the most essential prerequisites.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a later passage in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, at page 344, Hitler applies
these general ideas to Germany:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If in its historical development the German people had possessed
the unity of herd instinct by which other people have
so much benefited, then the German Reich would probably be
mistress of the globe today. World history would have
taken another course, and in this case no man can tell if
what many blinded pacifists hope to attain by petitioning,
whining and crying may not have been reached in this way;
namely, a peace which would not be based upon the waving
of olive branches and tearful misery-mongering of pacifist
old women, but a peace that would be guaranteed by the triumphant
sword of a people endowed with the power to master
the world and administer it in the service of a higher civilization.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These passages emphasize clearly Hitler’s love of war and scorn
of those whom he described as pacifists. The underlying message
of this book, which appears again and again, is, firstly, that the
struggle for existence requires the organization and use of force;
secondly, that the Aryan-German is superior to other races and
has the right to conquer and rule them; thirdly, that all doctrines
which preach peaceable solutions of international problems represent
a disastrous weakness in a nation that adopts them. Implicit
in the whole of the argument is a fundamental and arrogant
denial of the possibility of any rule of law in international
affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is in the light of these general doctrines of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>
that the more definite passages should be considered, in which
Hitler deals with specific problems of German foreign policy.
The very first page of the book contains a remarkable forecast
of Nazi policy:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“German-Austria must be restored to the great German
Motherland. And not, indeed on any grounds of economic
calculation whatsoever. No, no. Even if the union were a
matter of economic indifference, and even if it were to be
disadvantageous from the economic standpoint, still it ought
<span class='pageno' title='648' id='Page_648'></span>
to take place. People of the same blood should be in the same
Reich. The German people will have no right to engage in
a colonial policy until they shall have brought all their children
together in one State. When the territory of the Reich
embraces all the Germans and finds itself unable to assure
them a livelihood, only then can the moral right arise, from
the need of the people, to acquire foreign territory. The
plough is then the sword; and the tears of war will produce
the daily bread for the generations to come.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler, at page 553, declares that the mere restoration of Germany’s
frontiers as they were in 1914 would be wholly insufficient
for his purposes:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In regard to this point I should like to make the following
statement: To demand that the 1914 frontiers should be restored
is a glaring political absurdity that is fraught with
such consequences as to make the claim itself appear criminal.
The confines of the Reich as they existed in 1914 were
thoroughly illogical; because they were not really complete,
in the sense of including all the members of the German nation.
Nor were they reasonable, in view of the geographical
exigencies of military defense. They were not the consequence
of a political plan which had been well considered
and carried out, but they were temporary frontiers established
in virtue of a political struggle that had not been
brought to a finish; and indeed, they were partly the chance
result of circumstances.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In further elaboration of Nazi policy, Hitler does not merely
denounce the Treaty of Versailles; he desires to see a Germany
which is a world power with territory sufficient for a future German
people of a magnitude which he does not define. On page
554 he declares:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the future of the German nation the 1914 frontiers are
of no significance * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We National Socialists must stick firmly to the aim that
we have set for our foreign policy, namely, that the German
people must be assured the territorial area which is necessary
for it to exist on this earth. And only for such action
as is undertaken to secure those ends can it be lawful in the
eyes of God and our German posterity to allow the blood of
our people to be shed once again. Before God, because we
are sent into this world with the commission to struggle for
our daily bread, as creatures to whom nothing is donated
and who must be able to win and hold their position as lord
<span class='pageno' title='649' id='Page_649'></span>
of the earth only through their own intelligence and courage.
“And this justification must be established also before our
German posterity, on the grounds that for each one who has
shed his blood the life of a thousand others will be guaranteed
to posterity. The territory on which one day our
German peasants will be able to bring forth and nourish
their sturdy sons will justify the blood of the sons of the
peasants that has to be shed today. And the statesmen who
will have decreed this sacrifice may be persecuted by their
contemporaries, but posterity will absolve them from all guilt
for having demanded this offering from their people.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At page 557 Hitler writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany will either become a world power or will not continue
to exist at all. But in order to become a world power,
it needs that territorial magnitude which gives it the necessary
importance today and assures the existence of its citizens.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We must take our stand on the principles already mentioned
in regard to foreign policy, namely, the necessity of bringing
our territorial area into just proportion with the number of
our population. From the past we can learn only one lesson,
and that is that the aim which is to be pursued in our political
conduct must be twofold, namely: (1) the acquisition of
territory as the objective of our foreign policy and (2) the establishment
of a new and uniform foundation as the objective
of our political activities at home, in accordance with
our doctrine of nationhood.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, these passages from <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> raise the question,
where did Hitler expect to find the increased territory beyond the
1914 boundaries of Germany? To this Hitler’s answer is sufficiently
explicit. Reviewing the history of the German Empire
from 1871 to 1918, he wrote, on page 132:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore, the only possibility which Germany had of carrying
a sound territorial policy into effect was that of acquiring
new territory in Europe itself. Colonies cannot serve
this purpose so long as they are not suited for settlement by
Europeans on a large scale. In the nineteenth century it
was no longer possible to acquire such colonies by peaceful
means. Therefore, any attempt at such colonial expansion
would have meant an enormous military struggle. Consequently
it would have been more practical to undertake that
military struggle for new territory in Europe, rather than
to wage war for the acquisition of possessions abroad.
<span class='pageno' title='650' id='Page_650'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Such a decision naturally demanded that the nation’s undivided
energies should be devoted to it. A policy of that
kind, which requires for its fulfillment every ounce of available
energy on the part of everybody concerned, cannot be
carried into effect by half measures or in a hesitant manner.
The political leadership of the German Empire should then
have been directed exclusively to this goal. No political step
should have been taken in response to other considerations
than this task and the means of accomplishing it. Germany
should have been alive to the fact that such a goal could
have been reached only by war, and the prospect of war
should have been faced with calm and collected determination.
The whole system of alliances should have been envisaged
and valued from that standpoint.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If new territory were to be acquired in Europe it must have
been mainly at Russia’s cost, and once again the new German
Empire should have set out on its march along the same road
as was formerly trodden by the Teutonic Knights, this time
to acquire soil for the German plough by means of the German
sword and thus provide the nation with its daily bread.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To this program of expansion in the East Hitler returns again,
at the end of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>. After discussing the insufficiency of
Germany’s pre-war frontiers, he again points the path to the
East and declares that the <span class='it'>Drang nach Osten</span>, the drive to the
East, must be resumed:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore we National Socialists have purposely drawn a
line through the line of conduct followed by pre-war Germany
in foreign policy. We put an end to the perpetual Germanic
march towards the South and West of Europe and turn our
eyes towards the lands of the East. We finally put a stop
to the colonial and trade policy of pre-war times and pass
over to the territorial policy of the future. But when we
speak of new territory in Europe today we must principally
think of Russia and the border states subject to her.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler was shrewd enough to see that his aggressive designs
in the East might be endangered by a defensive alliance between
Russia, France, and perhaps England. His foreign policy, as
outlined in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, was to detach England and Italy from
France and Russia and to change the attitude of Germany towards
France from the defensive to the offensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On page 570 of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> he wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As long as the eternal conflict between France and Germany
is waged only in the form of a German defense against the
French attack, that conflict can never be decided, and from
<span class='pageno' title='651' id='Page_651'></span>
century to century Germany will lose one position after another.
If we study the changes that have taken place, from
the twelfth century up to our day, in the frontiers within
which the German language is spoken, we can hardly hope
for a successful issue to result from the acceptance and development
of a line of conduct which has hitherto been so
detrimental for us.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Only when the Germans have taken all this fully into account
will they cease from allowing the national will-to-live
to wear itself out in merely passive defense; but they will
rally together for a last decisive contest with France. And in
this contest the essential objective of the German nation
will be fought for. Only then will it be possible to put an end
to the eternal Franco-German conflict which has hitherto
proved so sterile.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Of course it is here presumed that Germany sees in the suppression
of France nothing more than a means which will
make it possible for our people finally to expand in another
quarter. Today there are eighty million Germans in Europe.
And our foreign policy will be recognized as rightly conducted
only when, after barely a hundred years, there will be 250
million Germans living on this Continent, not packed together
as the coolies in the factories of another Continent
but as tillers of the soil and workers whose labour will be a
mutual assurance for their existence.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, taken in conjunction with the facts of Nazi Germany’s
subsequent behavior towards other countries, shows that
from the very first moment that they attained power, and indeed
long before that time, Hitler and his confederates were engaged
in planning and fomenting aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Events have proved that <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> was no mere literary exercise
to be treated with easy indifference, as unfortunately it
was treated for so long. It was the expression of a fanatical faith
in force and fraud as the means to Nazi dominance in Europe, if
not in the whole world. In accepting and propagating the jungle
philosophy of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, the Nazi conspirators deliberately set
about to push civilization over the precipice of war.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg651a'>7. TREATY VIOLATIONS</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It might be thought, from the melancholy story of broken
treaties and violated assurances, that Hitler and the Nazi Government
did not even profess that it is necessary or desirable
to keep the pledged word. Outwardly, however, the professions
were very different. With regard to treaties, on the 18 October
<span class='pageno' title='652' id='Page_652'></span>
1933, Hitler said, “Whatever we have signed we will fulfill to
the best of our ability.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reservation is significant—“Whatever we have signed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, on 21 May 1935, Hitler said, “The German Government
will scrupulously maintain every treaty voluntarily signed,
even though it was concluded before their accession to power and
office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On assurances Hitler was even more emphatic. In the same
speech, the Reichstag Speech of 21 May 1935, Hitler accepted
assurances as being of equal obligation, and the world at that
time could not know that that meant of no obligation at all. What
he actually said was,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“And when I now hear from the lips of a British statesman
that such assurances are nothing and that the only proof of
sincerity is the signature appended to collective pacts, I must
ask Mr. Eden to be good enough to remember that it is a
question of assurance in any case. It is sometimes much
easier to sign treaties with the mental reservations that one
will consider one’s attitude at the decisive hour than to declare
before an entire nation and with full opportunity one’s
adherence to a policy which serves the course of peace because
it rejects anything which leads to war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then he proceeded with the illustration of his assurance to
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection the position of a treaty in German law
should not be forgotten. The appearance of a treaty in the
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> makes it part of the statute law of Germany,
so that a breach thereof is also a violation of German domestic
law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(This section deals with fifteen only of the treaties which Hitler
and the Nazis broke. The remainder of the 69 treaties which
the German Reich violated between 1933 and 1941 are dealt with
in other sections of this chapter.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes,
signed at the Hague on the 29th of July, 1899.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hague Conventions are of course only the first gropings
towards the rejection of the inevitability of war. They do not
render the making of aggressive war a crime, but their milder
terms were as readily broken as more severe agreements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 29 July, 1899, Germany, Greece, Serbia, and 25 other
nations signed a convention (<span class='it'>TC-1</span>). Germany ratified the convention
on 4 September 1900, Serbia on the 11 May 1901, Greece
on the 4 April 1901.
<span class='pageno' title='653' id='Page_653'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>By Article 12 of the treaty between the Principal Allied and
Associated Powers and the Serb-Croat-Slovene State, signed at
the St. Germaine-en-Laye on 10 September 1919, the new Kingdom
succeeded to all the old Serbian treaties, and later changed
its name to Yugoslavia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first two articles of this Hague Convention read:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 1: With a view to obviating as far as possible
recourse to force in the relations between states, the signatory
powers agree to use their best efforts to insure the
pacific settlement of International differences.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 2: In case of serious disagreement or conflict, before
an appeal to arms the signatory powers agree to have
recourse, as far as circumstances allow, to the good offices
or mediation of one or more friendly powers.” (<span class='it'>TC-1</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes,
signed at the Hague on 18 October 1907.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This Convention (<span class='it'>TC-2</span>) was signed at the Hague by 44 nations,
and it is in effect as to 31 nations, 28 signatories, and
three adherents. For present purposes it is in force as to the
United States, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Germany,
Luxembourg, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and
Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the provisions of Article 91 it replaces the 1899 Convention
as between the contracting powers. As Greece and Yugoslavia
are parties to the 1899 convention and not to the 1907,
the 1899 Convention is in effect with regard to them, and that
explains the division of countries in Appendix C.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first article of this treaty reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1: With a view to obviating as far as possible recourse to
force in the relations between States, the contracting powers
agree to use their best efforts to insure the pacific settlement
of international differences.” (<span class='it'>TC-2</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Convention Relative to the Opening of Hostilities, signed
at the Hague on 18 October 1907.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This Convention (<span class='it'>TC-3</span>) applies to Germany, Poland, Norway,
Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Russia.
It relates to a procedural step in notifying one’s prospective opponent
before opening hostilities against him. It appears, to
have had its immediate origin in the Russo-Japanese war of
1904, when Japan attacked Russia without any previous warning.
It will be noted that it does not fix any particular lapse of
time between the giving of notice and the commencement of
<span class='pageno' title='654' id='Page_654'></span>
hostilities, but it does seek to maintain an absolutely minimum
standard of International decency before the outbreak of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first article of this treaty reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The contracting powers recognize that hostilities between
them must not commence without a previous and explicit
warning in the form of either a declaration of war, giving
reasons, or an ultimatum with a conditional declaration of
war.” (<span class='it'>TC-3</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>Convention 5, Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral
Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, signed at the
Hague on 18 October 1907.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Germany was an original signatory to this Convention

<p class='pindent'>A point arises on this Convention. Under Article 20, the
provisions of the present Convention do not apply except between
the contracting powers, and then only if all the belligerents
are parties to the Convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Great Britain and France entered the war within two
days of the outbreak of the war between Germany and Poland,
and one of these powers had not ratified the Convention, it is
arguable that its provisions did not apply to the Second World
War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since there are many more important treaties to be considered,
the charge will not be pressed that this treaty was likewise
breached. The terms of Article 1 are cited merely as showing
the state of International opinion at the time, and as an element
in the aggressive character of the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Part I of this treaty (<span class='it'>TC-5 thru TC-10</span>) contains the Covenant
of the League of Nations, and Part II sets the boundaries of Germany
in Europe. These boundaries are described in detail. Part

<p class='noindent'>“To the German People:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Only a few months ago Germany was compelled to protect
her fellow-countrymen, living in well-defined settlements,
against the unbearable Czechoslovakian terror regime; and
during the last weeks the same thing has happened on an
ever-increasing scale. This is bound to create an intolerable
state of affairs within an area inhabited by citizens of so
many nationalities.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“These national groups, to counteract the renewed attacks
against their freedom and life, have now broken away from
the Prague Government. Czechoslovakia has ceased to exist.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Since Sunday at many places wild excesses have broken out,
amongst the victims of which are again many Germans.
Hourly the number of oppressed and persecuted people crying
for help is increasing. From areas thickly populated by
German-speaking inhabitants, which last autumn Czechoslovakia
was allowed by German generosity to retain, refugees
robbed of their personal belongings are streaming into the
Reich.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Continuation of such a state of affairs would lead to the destruction
of every vestige of order in an area in which Germany
is vitally interested particularly as for over one thousand
years it formed a part of the German Reich.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In order definitely to remove this menace to peace and to
create the conditions for a necessary new order in this living
space, I have today resolved to allow German troops to
<span class='pageno' title='658' id='Page_658'></span>
march into Bohemia and Moravia. They will disarm the terror
gangs and the Czechoslovakian forces supporting them,
and protect the lives of all who are menaced. Thus they will
lay the foundations for introducing a fundamental reordering
of affairs which will be in accordance with the 1,000-year
old history and will satisfy the practical needs of the German

<p class='pindent'>A footnote contains an order of the Fuehrer to the German

<p class='pindent'>F. <span class='it'>Treaty between the United States and Germany Restoring
Friendly Relations.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The purpose of this treaty (<span class='it'>TC-11</span>) was to complete the official
cessation of hostilities between the United States of America and
Germany; it also incorporated certain parts of the Treaty of Versailles.
The relevant portion is Part 5, which repeats the clauses
of the Treaty of Versailles which have been discussed immediately
above.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. <span class='it'>Treaty of Mutual Guarantee between Germany, Belgium,
France, Great Britain, and Italy, done at Locarno, 16 October
1925.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Several treaties were negotiated at Locarno; they all go together
and are to a certain extent mutually dependent. At Locarno,
Germany negotiated five treaties: (<span class='it'>a</span>) the Treaty of Mutual
Guarantee between Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain,
and Italy (<span class='it'>TC-12</span>); (<span class='it'>b</span>) the Arbitration Convention between Germany
and France; (<span class='it'>c</span>) the Arbitration Convention between Germany
and Belgium; (<span class='it'>d</span>) the Arbitration Treaty between Germany
and Poland; and (<span class='it'>e</span>) an Arbitration Treaty between Germany and
Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 10 of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee (<span class='it'>TC-12</span>) provided
that it should come into force as soon as ratifications were deposited
at Geneva in the archives of the League of Nations, and
as soon as Germany became a member of the League of Nations.
The ratifications were deposited on 14 September 1926, and Germany
became a member of the League of Nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two arbitration conventions and the two arbitration
treaties provided that they shall enter into force under the same
conditions as the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee. (Article 21 of
the arbitration conventions and Article 22 of the arbitration
treaties.)
<span class='pageno' title='662' id='Page_662'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The most important of the five agreements is the Treaty of
Mutual Guarantee (<span class='it'>TC-12</span>). One of the purposes was to establish
in perpetuity the borders between Germany and Belgium,
and Germany and France. It contains no provision for denunciation
or withdrawal therefrom and provides that it shall remain
in force until the Council of the League of Nations decides that
the League of Nations ensures sufficient protection to the parties
to the Treaty—an event which never happened in which case
the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee shall expire one year later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general scheme of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee is that
Article 1 provides that the parties guarantee three things: the
border between Germany and France, the border between Germany
and Belgium, and the demilitarization of the Rhineland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 2 provides that Germany and France, and Germany and
Belgium agree that they will not attack or invade each other,
with certain inapplicable exceptions; and Article 3 provides that
Germany and France, and Germany and Belgium agree to settle
all disputes between them by peaceful means. (<span class='it'>TC-12</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first important violation of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee
appears to have been the entry of German troops into the
Rhineland on 7 March 1936. The day after, France and Belgium
asked the League of Nations Council to consider the question of
the German reoccupation of the Rhineland and the purported repudiation
of the treaty. On 12 March, after a protest from the
British Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Belgium, France, Great
Britain, and Italy recognized unanimously that the reoccupation
was a violation of this treaty. On 14 March, the League Council
duly and properly decided that reoccupation was not permissible
and that the Rhineland clauses of the pact were not voidable by
Germany because of the alleged violation by France in the Franco-Soviet
Mutual Assistance Pact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the background to the treaty. The relevant articles are
1, 2, and 3, already mentioned; 4, which provides for the bringing
of violations before the Council of the League, as was done; and
5, which deals with the clauses of the Versailles Treaty already
mentioned. It provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The provisions of Article 3 of the present Treaty are placed
under the guarantee of the High Contracting Parties as provided
by the following stipulations:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If one of the Powers referred to in Article 3 refuses to submit
a dispute to peaceful settlement or to comply with an arbitral
or judicial decision and commits a violation of Article
2 of the present Treaty or a breach of Article 42 or 43 of
the Treaty of Versailles, the provisions of Article 4 of the
present Treaty shall apply.” (<span class='it'>TC-12</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='663' id='Page_663'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the procedure requiring reference to the League in the
case of a flagrant breach or of more stringent action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be recalled that Hitler had promised that the German
Government would scrupulously maintain their treaties voluntarily
signed, even though they were concluded before Hitler’s
accession to power. No one has ever argued that Stresemann
was in any way acting involuntarily when he signed this Locarno
Pact on behalf of Germany, along with the other representatives.
(The signature is not in Stresemann’s name, but by Herr
Hans Luther.) This treaty, which repeats the violated provisions
of the Versailles Treaty, was freely entered into and
binds Germany in that regard. Article 8 deals with the preliminary
enforcement of the Treaty by the League:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The present Treaty shall be registered at the League of
Nations in accordance with the Covenant of the League.
It shall remain in force until the Council, acting on a request
of one or other of the High Contracting Parties
notified to the other signatory Powers three months in
advance, and voting at least by a two-thirds majority, decides
that the League of Nations ensures sufficient protection
to the High Contracting Parties; the Treaty shall cease
to have effect on the expiration of a period of one year from
such decision.” (<span class='it'>TC-12</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, in signing this Treaty, the German representative clearly
placed the question of repudiation or violation of the Treaty in
the hands of others. Germany was at the time a member of the

<p class='pindent'>H. <span class='it'>Arbitration Treaty between Germany and Czechoslovakia,
signed at Locarno in October 1925.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Article I is the governing clause of this treaty (<span class='it'>TC-14</span>). It
provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“All disputes of every kind between Germany and Czechoslovakia
with regard to which the Parties are in conflict as
to their respective rights, and which it may not be possible
to settle amicably by the normal methods of diplomacy,
shall be submitted for decision either to an arbitral tribunal,
or to the Permanent Court of International Justice as laid
down hereafter. It is agreed that the disputes referred to
above include, in particular, those mentioned in Article 13
of the Covenant of the League of Nations. This provision
does not apply to disputes arising out of or prior to the
<span class='pageno' title='664' id='Page_664'></span>
present Treaty and belonging to the past. Disputes for the
settlement of which a special procedure is laid down on other
conventions in force between the High Contracting Parties,
shall be settled in conformity with the provisions of those
Conventions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This treaty was registered with the Secretariat of the League
in accordance with Article 22, the second sentence of which
shows that the Treaty was entered into and its terms in force
under the same conditions as the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee.
(<span class='it'>TC-12</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the Treaty to which President Benes unsuccessfully
appealed during the crisis in the Autumn of 1938.</p>

dealing with the invasion of Poland.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>K. <span class='it'>Declaration of the Assembly of the League of Nations of
24 September 1927.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Germany had become a member of the League of Nations on 10
September 1926, a year before this Declaration was made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of this Declaration is not only its effect on
International Law, but to the fact that it was unanimously
adopted by the Assembly of the League of Nations, of which
Germany was a free and active member at the time. Referring
to the unanimous adoption of the Declaration, M. Sokal, the
Polish Rapporteur, had this to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Committee was of opinion that, at the present juncture,
a solemn resolution passed by the Assembly, declaring
that wars of aggression must never be employed as a means
of settling disputes between States, and that such wars constitute
an international crime, would have a salutary effect
on public opinion, and would help to create an atmosphere
favorable to the League’s future work in the matter of
security and disarmament.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“While recognizing that the draft resolution does not constitute
a regular legal instrument, which would be adequate
<span class='pageno' title='665' id='Page_665'></span>
in itself and represent a concrete contribution towards security,
the Third Committee unanimously agreed as to its great
moral and educative value.” (<span class='it'>TC-18</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>M. Sokal then asked the Assembly to adopt the draft resolution,
the terms of which show what so many nations, including Germany,
had in mind at that time. The resolution recited that the
Assembly—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * recognizing the solidarity which unites the community
of nations, being inspired by a firm desire for the
maintenance of general peace, being convinced that a war of
aggression can never serve as a means of settling international
disputes, and in consequence an international crime;
considering that the solemn renunciation of all wars of aggression
would tend to create an atmosphere of general confidence
calculated to facilitate the progress of the work undertaken
with a view to disarmament:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Declares: 1. That all wars of aggression are and shall always
be prohibited.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. That every pacific means must be employed to settle disputes
of every description, which may arise between States.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“That the Assembly declares that the States Members of the
League are under an obligation to conform to these principles.”
(<span class='it'>TC-18</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The fact of the solemn renunciation of war was taken in the form
of a roll call, and the President announced that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“All the delegations having pronounced in favour of the declaration
submitted by the Third Committee, I declare it
unanimously adopted.” (<span class='it'>TC-18</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>L. <span class='it'>The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(This treaty, <span class='it'>TC-19</span>, is discussed in Sir Hartley Shawcross’s
opening address for Great Britain, to be found in Section 5,
<span class='it'>supra</span>.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. <span class='it'>Assurances.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Austria.</span> On 21 May 1935 Hitler made a speech containing
this assurance:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany neither intends nor wishes to interfere in the domestic
affairs of Austria, to annex Austria, or to attach that
country to her. The German people and the German Government
have, however, the very comprehensible desire, arising
out of the simple feeling of solidarity due to a common
national descent, that the right to self-determination should
<span class='pageno' title='666' id='Page_666'></span>
be guaranteed not only to foreign nations, but to the German
people everywhere.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I myself believe that no regime which is not anchored in
the people, supported by the people, and desired by the people,
can exist permanently.” (<span class='it'>TC-26</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Similarly, in the Agreement between the German Government
and the Government of the Federal State of Austria, on July 11,
1936, paragraph one stated as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Government recognizes the full sovereignty of
the Federal State of Austria in the sense of the pronouncements
of the German Leader and Chancellor of the 21st May,
1935.” (<span class='it'>TC-22</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Czechoslovakia.</span> The German Assurance to Czechoslovakia
is contained in the letter from M. Jan Masaryk to Viscount
Halifax on the date of 12 March 1938 (<span class='it'>TC-27</span>). The first paragraph
shows that Field Marshall Goering used the expression
“<span class='it'>Ich gebe Ihnen Mein Ehrenwort</span>.” That means, “I give my word
of honor.” The third paragraph shows that Goering had asked
that there would not be a mobilization of the Czechoslovak Army.
The fourth paragraph reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“M. Mastny was in a position to give him definite and binding
assurances on this subject, and today he spoke with
Baron von Neurath, who, among other things, assured him
on behalf of Herr Hitler that Germany still considers herself
bound by the German-Czechoslovak Arbitration Convention
concluded at Locarno in October 1925.” (<span class='it'>TC-27</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>So that in 1935 Baron von Neurath was speaking on behalf of
Germany on an agreement voluntarily concluded. Had there
been the slightest doubt of that question, von Neurath gave the
assurance on behalf of Hitler that Germany still considered itself
bound by the German-Czechoslovakia Arbitration Convention
on the 12 March 1938, six months before Dr. Benes made a
hopeless appeal to it before the crisis in the Army in 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Czechoslovakia’s difficult position is set out in the pregnant
last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“They can not however fail to view with great apprehension
the sequel of events in Austria between the date of the bi-lateral
agreement between Germany and Austria, 11 July
1936, and yesterday, 11 March 1938.” (<span class='it'>TC-27</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 26 September 1938, Hitler made an assurance to Czechoslovakia
which contains important points as to the alleged German
policy of getting Germans together in the Reich, for which
the Nazi conspirators had purported to request a considerable
time:
<span class='pageno' title='667' id='Page_667'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have a little to explain. I am grateful to Mr. Chamberlain
for all his efforts, and I have assured him that the German
people want nothing but peace; but I have also told him
that I can not go back beyond the limits of our patience.”
(<span class='it'>TC-28</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>(This occurred between the Godesberg Treaty and the Munich
Pact).</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I assured him, moreover, and I repeat it here, that when
this problem is solved there will be no more territorial problems
for Germany in Europe. And I further assured him
that from the moment when Czechoslovakia solves its other
problems, that is to say, when the Czechs have come to an
arrangement with their other minorities peacefully, and without
oppression, I will no longer be interested in the Czech
State. And that, as far as I am concerned, I will guarantee
it. We don’t want any Czechs. But I must also declare before
the German people that in the Sudeten-German problem
my patience is now at an end. I made an offer to Herr Benes
which was no more than the realization of what he had already
promised. He now has peace or war in his hands.
Either he will accept this offer and at length give the Germans
their freedom, or we will get this freedom for ourselves.”
(<span class='it'>TC-28</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Munich Agreement of 29 September 1938 (<span class='it'>TC-23</span>) was
signed by Hitler, later by Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Daladier, and
Mussolini. It is largely a procedural agreement by which the
entry of German troops into Sudeten-Deutsche territory is regulated.
That is shown by the preliminary clause:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy, taking
into consideration the agreement which has been already
reached in principle for the cession to Germany of the Sudeten-German
territory have agreed on the following terms
and conditions governing the said cession and the measures
consequent thereon, and by this agreement they each hold
themselves responsible for the steps necessary to secure fulfillment.”
(<span class='it'>TC-23</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Article 4 states that “The occupation by stages of the predominantly
German territory by German troops will begin on 1 October.”
The four territories are marked on the attached map. Article
6 provides that “The final determination of the frontiers
will be carried out by the international commission.” (<span class='it'>TC-23</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The agreement provides also for various rights of option and
release from the Czech forces of Sudeten-Germans (TC-23). That
was what Hitler was asking for in the somewhat rhetorical passage
previously referred to (<span class='it'>TC-28</span>).
<span class='pageno' title='668' id='Page_668'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There is an annex to the Munich Agreement which is most
significant:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Annex to the Agreement:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the
French Government have entered into the above Agreement
on the basis that they stand by the offer contained in Paragraph
6 of the Anglo-French Proposal of the 19th September,
relating to an international guarantee of the new boundaries
of the Czechoslovak State against unprovoked aggression.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“When the question of the Polish and Hungarian minorities
in Czechoslovakia has been settled Germany and Italy, for
their part, will give a guarantee to Czechoslovakia.” (<span class='it'>TC-23</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The provision concerns “the Polish and Hungarian minorities,”
not the question of Slovakia. That is why that the German action
of the 15th of March was a flagrant violation of the letter and
spirit of that Agreement. (For fuller discussion see Section 4
of this Chapter relating to aggression against Czechoslovakia.)</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg673a'>8. AGGRESSION AGAINST POLAND, DANZIG, ENGLAND<br/> AND FRANCE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Treaties Breached.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the general treaties involved—The Hague Convention
in respect of the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes
(<span class='it'>TC-2</span>); other Hague Conventions of 1907 (<span class='it'>TC-3</span>; <span class='it'>TC-4</span>);
the Versailles Treaty (<span class='it'>TC-9</span>) in respect of the Free City of Danzig;
and the Kellogg-Briand Pact (<span class='it'>TC-19</span>)—two specific agreements
were violated by the German attack on Poland. These
were the Arbitration Treaty between Germany and Poland, signed
at Locarno on 16 October 1925, and the Declaration of Non-Aggression
which was entered into between Germany and Poland
on 26 January 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German-Polish Arbitration Treaty (<span class='it'>TC-15</span>) declares in the
preamble and Articles 1 and 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The President of the German Empire and the President of
the Polish Republic:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Equally resolved to maintain peace between Germany and
Poland by assuring the peaceful settlement of differences
which might arise between the two countries;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Declaring that respect for the rights established by treaty
or resulting from the law of nations is obligatory for international
tribunals;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Agreeing to recognize that the rights of a State cannot be
modified save with its consent;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“And considering that sincere observance of the methods of
peaceful settlement of international disputes permits of resolving,
without recourse to force, questions which may become
the cause of division between States;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Have decided .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 1: All disputes of every kind between Germany and
Poland with regard to which the Parties are in conflict as
to their respective rights, and which it may not be possible
to settle amicably by the normal methods of diplomacy, shall
be submitted for decision either to an arbitral tribunal or
to the Permanent Court of International Justice, as laid down
hereafter.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 2: Before any resort is made to arbitral procedure
before the Permanent Court of International Justice, the dispute
may, by agreement between the Parties, be submitted,
with a view to amicable settlement, to a permanent international
commission, styled the Permanent Conciliation Commission,
constituted in accordance with the present Treaty.”
(<span class='it'>TC-15</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='674' id='Page_674'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Thereafter the treaty goes on to lay down the procedure for arbitration
and for conciliation. Germany, however, in September
1939 attacked and invaded Poland without having first attempted
to settle its disputes with Poland by peaceful means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second specific treaty, the German-Polish Declaration of
26 January 1934, reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Government and the Polish Government consider
that the time has come to introduce a new era in the
political relations between Germany and Poland by a direct
understanding between the States. They have therefore
decided to establish by the present declaration a basis for
the future shaping of those relations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The two Governments assume that the maintenance and
assurance of a permanent peace between their countries is an
essential condition for general peace in Europe.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The declaration shall remain in effect for a period of ten
years counting from the day of exchange of instruments of
ratification. In case it is not denounced by one of the two
governments six months before the expiration of that period
of time, it shall continue in effect but can then be denounced
by either government at a time of six months and at any
time in advance.” (TC-21)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>German Intentions Before March 1939.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been previously shown that the actions against Austria
and Czechoslovakia were in themselves part of the preparation
for further aggression. Even at that time, before the Germans
had seized the whole of Czechoslovakia, they were perfectly prepared
to fight England, Poland, and France, if necessary, to
achieve those aims. They appreciated the whole time that they
might well have to do so. Furthermore, although not until after
March 1939, did they commence upon their immediate and specific
preparations for a specific war against Poland, nevertheless,
they had for a considerable time before had it in mind specifically
to attack Poland once Czechoslovakia was completely theirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this period also—and this happens throughout the
whole story of the Nazi regime in Germany—as afterwards,
while they were making their preparations and carrying out their
plans, they were giving to the outside world assurance after
assurance so as to lull them out of any suspicion of their real
object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the agreement with Poland was signed in January 1934,
Hitler had this to say:
<span class='pageno' title='675' id='Page_675'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When I took over the Government on the 30th of January,
the relations between the two countries seemed to me more
than unsatisfactory. There was a danger that the existing
differences which were due to the Territorial Clauses of the
Treaty of Versailles and the mutual tension resulting therefrom
would gradually crystalize into a state of hostility
which, if persisted, might too easily acquire the character
of a dangerous traditional enmity.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the spirit of this Treaty the German Government is willing
and prepared to cultivate economic relations with Poland
in such a way that here, too, the state of unprofitable suspicion
can be succeeded by a period of useful cooperation. It
is a matter of particular satisfaction to us that in this same
year the National Socialist Government of Danzig has been
enabled to effect a similar clarification of its relations with
its Polish neighbor.” (<span class='it'>TC-70</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That was in 1934. Three years later, again on 30 January,
speaking in the Reichstag, Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“By a series of agreements we have eliminated existing tension
and thereby contributed considerably to an improvement
in the European atmosphere. I merely recall an agreement
with Poland which has worked out to the advantage of
both sides. True statesmanship will not overlook reality
but consider them. The Italian nation and the new Italian
state are realities. The German nation and the German
Reich are equally realities, and to my own fellow citizens I
would say that the Polish nation and the Polish state have
also become a reality.” (<span class='it'>2868-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That was on 30 January 1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 24 June 1937, a “Top Secret Order (<span class='it'>C-175</span>) was issued
by the Reich Minister for War and Commander in Chief of the
Armed Forces, signed “Von Blomberg”. There is the notation
at the top, “Written by an Officer. Outgoing documents in connection
with this matter and dealing with it in principle are to be
written by an officer.” With it is enclosed a Directive for the
Unified Preparation for War of the Armed Forces, to come into
force on 1 August 1937. The enclosed directive is divided into
Part 1, “General Guiding Principle”; Part 2, “Likely Warlike
Eventualities”; Part 3, “Special Preparations”. The substance
of the document justifies the supposition that Germany need not
consider an attack from any side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second paragraph states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The intention to unleash a European war is held
<span class='pageno' title='676' id='Page_676'></span>
just as little by Germany. Nevertheless, the politically fluid
world situation, which does not preclude surprising incidents,
demands a continuous preparedness for war of the
German Armed Forces.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“To counter attacks at any time, and to enable the military
exploitation of politically favorable opportunities should
they occur.” (<span class='it'>C-175</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The preparations which are to be made are then set forth:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The further working on mobilization without public
announcement in order to put the Armed Forces in a position
to begin a war suddenly and by surprise both as regards
strength and time.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Special preparations are to be made for the following
eventualities: Armed intervention against Austria; warlike
entanglement with Red Spain.” (<span class='it'>C-175</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another passage shows clearly how they appreciated at that
time that their actions against Austria and Czechoslovakia might
well involve them in war.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * England, Poland, Lithuania take part in a war
against us.” (<span class='it'>C-175</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Part 2 of this directive, dealing with “Probable warlike eventualities—Concentrations,”
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. War on two fronts with focal point in the West.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Suppositions. In the West France is the opponent. Belgium
may side with France, either at once or later or not at all.
It is also possible that France may violate Belgium’s neutrality
if the latter is neutral. She will certainly violate that
of Luxembourg.” (<span class='it'>C-175</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Part 3, which deals in part with “Special Case—Extension Red-Green,”
declares:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The military political starting point used as a basis for
concentration plans Red and Green can be aggravated if
either England, Poland or Lithuania join on the side of our
opponents. Thereupon our military position would be worsened
to an unbearable, even hopeless, extent. The political
leaders will therefore do everything to keep these countries
neutral, above all England and Poland.” (<span class='it'>C-175</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The date of this order is June 1937, and it seems clear that at
that date, anyway, the Nazi Government appreciated the likelihood,
if not the probability, of fighting England and Poland and
France, and were prepared to do so. On 5 November 1937, Hitler
held his conference in the Reichschancellery, the minutes of
<span class='pageno' title='677' id='Page_677'></span>
which, referred to as the Hossbach notes, contain the remarks
made by Hitler in respect of England, Poland, and France:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer then stated: ‘The aim of German policy is the
security and preservation of the nation and its propagation.
This is consequently a problem of space’.” (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Hitler then went on to discuss what he described as “participation
in world economy”, and declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The only way out, and one which may appear imaginary,
is the securing of greater living space, an endeavor which at
all times has been the cause of the formation of states and
movements of nations.” (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The history of all times, Roman Empire, British Empire,
has proved that every space expansion can only be effected
by breaking resistance and taking risks. Even setbacks are
unavoidable. Neither formerly nor today has space been
found without an owner. The attacker always comes up
against the proprietor.” (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the same day as this Hossbach meeting in the Reichschancellery
was taking place, a communique was being issued as a result
of the Polish ambassador’s audience with Hitler (<span class='it'>TC-73 No.
33</span>). In the course of this conversation, the communique stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It was confirmed that Polish-German relations should not
meet with difficulty because of the Danzig question.” (<span class='it'>TC-73
No. 33</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 2 January 1938, some unknown person wrote a memorandum
for the Fuehrer. This document is headed, “Very Confidential—Personal
Only”, and is entitled “Deduction on the report,
German Embassy, London, regarding the future form of
Anglo-German relations.” It states in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“With the realization that Germany will not tie herself to
a status quo in Central Europe, and that sooner or later a
military conflict in Europe is possible, the hope of an agreement
will slowly disappear among Germanophile British politicians,
insofar as they are not merely playing a part that
has been given to them. Thus the fateful question arises:
Will Germany and England eventually be forced to drift into
separate camps and will they march against each other one
day? To answer this question, one must realize the following:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Change of the status quo in the east in the German sense
can only be carried out by force. So long as France knows
that England, which so to speak has, taken on a guarantee
to aid France against Germany, is on her side, France’s fighting
<span class='pageno' title='678' id='Page_678'></span>
for her eastern allies is probable in any case, always
possible, and thus with it war between Germany and England.
This applies then even if England does not want war.
England, believing she must attend her borders on the Rhine,
would be dragged in automatically by France. In other words,
peace or war between England and Germany rests solely in
the hands of France, who could bring about such a war between
Germany and England by way of a conflict between
Germany and France. It follows therefore that war between
Germany and England on account of France can be prevented
only if France knows from the start that England’s forces
would not be sufficient to guarantee their common victory.
Such a situation might force England, and thereby France,
to accept a lot of things that a strong Anglo-France coalition
would never tolerate.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This position would arise for instance if England, through
insufficient armament or as a result of threats to her empire
by a superior coalition of powers, e.g., Germany, Italy,
Japan, thereby tying down her military forces in other places,
would not be able to assure France of sufficient support in
Europe:”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The writer goes on to discuss the possibility of a strong partnership
between Italy and Japan, and then reaches a summary:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Paragraph five: Therefore, conclusions to be drawn by us.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Outwardly, further understanding with England in regard
to the protection of the interests of our friends.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Formation under great secrecy, but with whole-hearted
tenacity of a coalition against England, that is to say, a
tightening of our friendship with Italy and Japan; also the
winning over of all nations whose interests conform with
ours directly or indirectly.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Close and confidential cooperation of the diplomats of the
three great powers towards this purpose. Only in this way
can we confront England be it in a settlement or in war.
England is going to be a hard, astute opponent in this game
of diplomacy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The particular question whether in the event of a war by
Germany in central Europe France and thereby England
would interfere, depends on the circumstances and the time
at which such a war commences and ceases, and on military
considerations which cannot be gone into here.” (<span class='it'>TC-75</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Whoever it was who wrote that document, appears to have
been on a fairly high level, because he concludes by saying, “I
<span class='pageno' title='679' id='Page_679'></span>
should like to give the Fuehrer some of these viewpoints verbally.”
(<span class='it'>TC-75</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 20 February 1938, Hitler spoke in the Reichstag. In that
speech he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the fifth year following the first great foreign political
agreement with the Reich, it fills us with sincere gratification
to be able to state that in our relations with the state with
which we had had perhaps the greatest difference, not only
has there been a ‘detente,’ but in the course of the years
there has been a constant improvement in relations. This
good work, which was regarded with suspicion by so many
at the time, has stood the test, and I may say that since the
League of Nations finally gave up its continual attempts to
unsettle Danzig and appointed a man of great personal attainments
as the new commissioner, this most dangerous
spot from the point of view of European peace has entirely
lost its menacing character. The Polish State respects the
national conditions in this state, and both the city of Danzig
and Germany respect Polish rights. And so the way to an
understanding has been successfully paved, an understanding
which beginning with Danzig has today, in spite of the
attempts of certain mischief-makers, succeeded in finally taking
the poison out of the relations between Germany and
Poland and transforming them into a sincere, friendly cooperation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“To rely on her friendships, Germany will not leave a stone
unturned to save that ideal which provides the foundation
for the task which is ahead of us—peace.” (<span class='it'>2357-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A memorandum dated 2 May 1938, and entitled, “Organizational
Study 1950,” originated in the office of the Chief of the
Organizational Staff of the General Staff of the Air Force. Its
purpose was said to be: “The task is to search, within a framework
of very broadly-conceived conditions, for the most suitable
type of organization of the Air Force.” (<span class='it'>L-43</span>). The result gained
is termed, “Distant Objective.” From this is deduced the goal
to be reached in the second phase of the process, which is called,
“Final Objective 1942.” This in turn yields what is considered
the most suitable proposal for the reorganization of the staffs of
the Air Force Group Commands, Air Gaus, Air Divisions, etc.
(<span class='it'>L-43</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Table of Contents is divided into various sections. Section
I is entitled, “Assumptions.” In connection with the heading
“Assumption I, frontier of Germany”, a map is enclosed (<span class='it'>Chart
No. 10</span>). The map shows that on 2 May 1938 the Air Force was
<span class='pageno' title='680' id='Page_680'></span>
in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria,
and Hungary, all of which are shown as within the boundaries
of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following is a pertinent extract from the memorandum:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Consideration of the principles of organization on the basis
of the assumptions for war and peace made in Section 1:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Attack Forces: Principal adversaries: England, France,
and Russia.” (<span class='it'>L-43</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The study then goes on to show all the one hundred forty-four
<span class='it'>Geschwader</span> employed against England, very much concentrated
in the Western half of the Reich; that is to say, they must be
deployed in such a way that by making full use of their range,
they can reach all English territory down to the last corner. Under
the paragraph “Assumption” double heading 2, the “Organization
of Air Force in peacetime” is shown and seven group commands
are indicated: (1) Berlin; (2) Brunswick; (3) Munich;
(4) Vienna; (5) Budapest; (6) Warsaw; and (7) Koenigsberg.
(<span class='it'>L-43</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>Finally, the study declares:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The more the Reich grows in area and the more the Air
Force grows in strength, the more imperative it becomes, to
have locally bound commands * * *” (<span class='it'>L-43</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The original of this document is signed by an officer who is not
at the top rank in the German Air Force, and the inferences that
can be drawn from it should therefore not be over-emphasized.
At least, however, it shows the lines upon which the General Staff
of the Air Force were thinking at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 26 August 1938, when Ribbentrop had become Foreign
Minister succeeding von Neurath, a document was addressed
to him as “The Reich Minister, via the State Secretary.” The
document reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The most pressing problem of German policy, the Czech
problem, might easily, but must not lead to a conflict with
the Entente. Neither France nor England are looking for
trouble regarding Czechoslovakia. Both would perhaps leave
Czechoslovakia to herself, if she should, without direct foreign
interference and through internal signs of disintegration,
due to her own faults, suffer the fate she deserves. This
process, however, would have to take place step by step and
would have to lead to a loss of power in the remaining territory
by means of a plebiscite and an annexation of territory.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Czech problem is not yet politically acute enough for
any immediate action, which the Entente would watch inactively,
and not even if this action should come quickly and
<span class='pageno' title='681' id='Page_681'></span>
surprisingly. Germany cannot fix any definite time and this
fruit could be plucked without too great a risk. She can only
prepare the desired developments.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For this purpose the slogan emanating from England at
present of the right for autonomy of the Sudeten-Germans,
which we have intentionally not used up to now, is to be
taken up gradually. The international conviction that the
choice of nationality was being withheld from these Germans
will do useful spadework, notwithstanding the fact that the
chemical process of dissolution of the Czech form of states
may or may not be finally speeded up by the mechanical
means as well. The fate of the actual body of Czechoslovakia,
however, would not as yet be clearly decided by this,
but would nevertheless be definitely sealed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This method of approach towards Czechoslovakia is to be
recommended because of our relationship with Poland. It
is unavoidable that the German departure from the problems
of boundaries in the southeast and their transfer to the east
and northeast must make the Poles sit up. The fact [is] that
after the liquidation of the Czech question, it will be generally
assumed that Poland will be the next in turn.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“But the later this assumption sinks in in international politics
as a firm factor, the better. In this sense, however, it is
important for the time being, to carry on the German policy,
under the well known and proved slogans of ‘the right to
autonomy’ and ‘Racial unity’. Anything else might be interpreted
as pure imperialism on our part and create the
resistance to our plan by the Entente at an earlier date and
more energetically, than our forces could stand up to.”
(<span class='it'>TC-76</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That was on 26 August 1938, just as the Czech crisis was leading
up to the Munich settlement. While at Munich, a day or two
before the Munich agreement was signed, Herr Hitler made a
speech. On 26 September he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I assured him, moreover, and I repeat it here, that when
this problem is solved there will be no more territorial problems
for Germany in Europe.” (<span class='it'>TC-29</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A letter from Admiral Carl, dated some time in September,
with no precise date, and entitled “Opinion on the ‘Draft Study
of Naval Warfare against England’,” stated as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“There is full agreement with the main theme of the study.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If according to the Fuehrer’s decision Germany is to acquire
a position as a world power who needs not only sufficient
<span class='pageno' title='682' id='Page_682'></span>
colonial possessions but also secure naval communications
and secure access to the ocean.” (<span class='it'>C-23</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That, then, was the position at the time of the Munich agreement
in September 1938. The gains of Munich were not, of
course, so great as the Nazi Government had hoped and intended.
As a result, the conspirators were not prepared straight away to
start any further aggressive action against Poland or elsewhere.
But with the advantages that were gained by the seizure of Czechoslovakia,
it is obvious now that they intended and had taken
the decision to proceed against Poland so soon as Czechoslovakia
had been entirely occupied. As Jodl and Hitler said on subsequent
occasions, Czechoslovakia was only setting the stage for
the attack on Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is known now from what Hitler said in talking to his military
commanders at a later date, that, in his own words, from
the first he never intended to abide by the Munich agreement,
but that he had to have the whole of Czechoslovakia. As a result,
although not ready to proceed in full force against Poland, after
September 1938 they did at once begin to approach the Poles on
the question of Danzig until the whole of Czechoslovakia had been
taken in March. Immediately after the Sudetenland had been
occupied, preliminary steps were taken to stir up trouble with
Poland, which would and was to eventually lead to the Nazi excuse
or justification for their attack on that country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The earlier discussions between the German and Polish governments
on the question of Danzig, which commenced almost immediately
after the Munich crisis in September 1938, began as
cautious and friendly discussions, until the remainder of Czechoslovakia
had finally been seized in March of the following year.
A document taken from the Official Polish White Book, gives an
account of a luncheon which took place at the Grand Hotel,
Berchtesgaden, on 25 October, where Ribbentrop had discussions
with M. Lipski, the Polish ambassador to Germany. The report
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In a conversation on 24 October, over a luncheon at the
Grand Hotel, Berchtesgaden, at which M. Hewel was present,
M. von Ribbentrop put forward a proposal for a general settlement
of issues (<span class='it'>Gesamtloesung</span>) between Poland and Germany.
This included the reunion of Danzig with the Reich,
while Poland would be assured the retention of railway and
economic facilities there. Poland would agree to the building
of an extra-territorial motor road and railway line across
Pomorze. In exchange M. von Ribbentrop mentioned the
possibility of an extension of the Polish-German Agreement
<span class='pageno' title='683' id='Page_683'></span>
by twenty-five years and a guarantee of Polish-German frontiers.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Finally, I said that I wished to warn M. von Ribbentrop
that I could see no possibility of an agreement involving the
reunion of the Free City with the Reich. I concluded by
promising to communicate the substance of this conversation
to you.” (<span class='it'>TC-73 No. 44</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It seems clear that the whole question of Danzig, as indeed
Hitler himself said, was no question at all. Danzig was raised
simply as an excuse, a justification, not for the seizure of Danzig
but for the invasion and seizure of the whole of Poland. As the
story unfolds it will become ever more apparent that that is what
the Nazi conspirators were really aiming at, only providing themselves
with some kind of crisis which would afford some kind of
justification for attacking Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another document taken from the Polish White Book (<span class='it'>TC-73
No. 45</span>) sets out the instructions that Mr. Beck, the Polish Foreign
Minister, gave to Mr. Lipski to hand to the German government
in reply to the suggestions put forward by Ribbentrop at Berchtesgaden
on 24 October. The first part reviews the history of
Polish-German relationship and emphasizes the needs of Poland
in respect to Danzig. Paragraph 6 of the document states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the circumstances, in the understanding of the Polish
government, the Danzig question is governed by two factors:
the right of the German population of the city and the surrounding
villages to freedom of life and development; and
the fact that in all matters appertaining to the Free City as
a port it is connected with Poland. Apart from the national
character of the majority of the population, everything in
Danzig is definitely bound up with Poland.” (<span class='it'>TC-73 No. 45</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The document then sets out the guarantees to Poland under the
statute, and continues as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Taking all the foregoing factors into consideration, and desiring
to achieve the stabilization of relations by way of a
friendly understanding with the government of the German
Reich, the Polish government proposes the replacement of
the League of Nations guarantee and its prerogatives by a
bi-lateral Polish-German Agreement. This agreement should
guarantee the existence of the Free City of Danzig so as to
assure freedom of national and cultural life to its German
majority, and also should guarantee all Polish rights. Notwithstanding
the complications involved in such a system,
the Polish government must state that any other solution,
<span class='pageno' title='684' id='Page_684'></span>
and in particular any attempt to incorporate the Free City
into the Reich, must inevitably lead to a conflict. This would
not only take the form of local difficulties, but also would
suspend all possibility of Polish-German understanding in
all its aspects.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In face of the weight and cogency of these questions, I am
ready to have final conversations personally with the governing
circles of the Reich. I deem it necessary, however, that
you should first present the principles to which we adhere, so
that my eventual contact should not end in a breakdown,
which would be dangerous for the future.” (<span class='it'>TC-73 No. 45</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The first stage in those negotiations had been entirely successful
from the German point of view. The Nazis had put forward
a proposal, the return of the City of Danzig to the Reich, which
they might well have known would have been unacceptable. It
was unacceptable and the Polish government had warned the Nazi
government that it would be. The Poles had offered to enter into
negotiations, but they had not agreed, which is exactly what the
German government had hoped for. They had not agreed to the
return of Danzig to the Reich. The first stage in producing the
crisis had been accomplished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly afterwards, within a week or so, and after the Polish
government had offered to enter into discussions with the German
government, another top secret order was issued by the Supreme
Command of the Armed Forces, signed by Keitel (<span class='it'>C-137</span>). Copies
went to the OKH, OKM, and OKW. The order is headed “First
Supplement to Instruction dated 21 October 1938,” and reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer has ordered: Apart from the three contingencies
mentioned in the instructions of 21 October 1938,
preparations are also to be made to enable the Free State of
Danzig to be occupied by German troops by surprise.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The preparations will be made on the following basis: Condition
is <span class='it'>quasi-revolutionary</span> occupation of Danzig, exploiting a
politically favorable situation, <span class='it'>not a war against Poland</span>.”
(<span class='it'>C-137</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of Czechoslovakia had not yet been seized, and
therefore the Nazis were not yet ready to go to war with Poland.
But Keitel’s order shows how the German government answered
the Polish proposal to enter into discussions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 5 January 1939 Mr. Beck had a conversation with Hitler.
(<span class='it'>TC-73 No. 48</span>). Ribbentrop was also present. In the first part
of that conversation, of which that document is an account, Hitler
offered to answer any questions. He said he had always followed
the policy laid down by the 1934 agreement. He discussed
<span class='pageno' title='685' id='Page_685'></span>
the question of Danzig and emphasized that in the German view it
must sooner or later return to Germany. The conversation continued:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Mr. Beck replied that the Danzig question was a very difficult
problem. He added that in the Chancellor’s suggestion
he did not see any equivalent for Poland, and that the whole
of Polish opinion, and not only people thinking politically
but the widest spheres of Polish society, were particularly
sensitive on this matter.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In answer to this the Chancellor stated that to solve this
problem it would be necessary to try to find something quite
new, some new form, for which he used the term ‘<span class='it'>Korperschaft</span>,’
which on the one hand would safeguard the interests
of the German population, and on the other the Polish interests.
In addition, the Chancellor declared that the Minister
could be quite at ease, there would be no faits accomplis in
Danzig and nothing would be done to render difficult the situation
of the Polish Government.” (<span class='it'>TC-73 No. 48</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It will be recalled that in the previous document discussed
(<span class='it'>C-137</span>) orders had already been issued for preparations to be
made for the occupation of Danzig by surprise. Yet some six
weeks later Hitler assured the Polish Foreign Minister that there
would be no fait accompli and that he should be quite at his ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day after the conversation between Beck and Hitler,
Beck and Ribbentrop conferred, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Mr. Beck asked M. Von Ribbentrop to inform the Chancellor
that whereas previously, after all his conversations
and contacts with German statesmen, he had been feeling
optimistic, today for the first time he was in a pessimistic
mood. Particularly in regard to the Danzig question, as it
had been raised by the Chancellor, he saw no possibility
whatever of agreement.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In answer M. Von Ribbentrop once more emphasized that
Germany was not seeking any violent solution. The basis of
their policy towards Poland was still a desire for the further
building up of friendly relations. It was necessary to seek
such a method of clearing away the difficulties as would respect
the rights and interests of the two parties concerned.”
(<span class='it'>TC-73 No. 49</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop apparently was not satisfied with that one expression
of good faith. On the 25th of the same month, January
1939, he was in Warsaw and made another speech, of which the
following is a pertinent extract:
<span class='pageno' title='686' id='Page_686'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In accordance with the resolute will of the German National
Leader, the continual progress and consolidation of
friendly relations between Germany and Poland, based upon
the existing agreement between us, constitute an essential
element in German foreign policy. The political foresight,
and the principles worthy of true statesmanship, which induced
both sides to take the momentous decision of 1934,
provide a guarantee that all other problems arising in the
course of the future evolution of events will also be solved in
the same spirit, with due regard to the respect and understanding
of the rightful interests of both sides. Thus Poland
and Germany can look forward to the future with full
confidence in the solid basis of their mutual relations.” (<span class='it'>2530-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler spoke in the Reichstag on 30 January 1939, and gave
further assurances of the good faith of the German Government.
(<span class='it'>TC-73 No. 57</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In March 1939 the remainder of Czechoslovakia was seized
and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was set up. That
seizure, as was recognized by Hitler and Jodl, had immensely
strengthened the German position against Poland. Within a
week of the completion of the occupation of Czechoslovakia heat
was beginning to be applied on Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 21 March M. Lipski, the Polish ambassador, saw Ribbentrop.
The nature of the conversation was generally very much
sharper than that of the discussion between Ribbentrop and Beck
a little time back at the Grand Hotel, Berchtesgaden:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I saw M. Von Ribbentrop today. He began by saying he
had asked me to call on him in order to discuss Polish-German
relations in their entirety.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“He complained about our Press, and the Warsaw students’
demonstrations during Count Ciano’s visit.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Further, M. von Ribbentrop referred to the conversation at
Berchtesgaden between you and the Chancellor, in which
Hitler put forward the idea of guaranteeing Poland’s frontiers
in exchange for a motor road and the incorporation
of Danzig in the Reich. He said that there had been further
conversations between you and him in Warsaw on the subject,
and that you had pointed out the great difficulties in the
way of accepting these suggestions. He gave me to understand
that all this had made an unfavorable impression on
the Chancellor, since so far he had received no positive reaction
whatever on our part to his suggestions. M. von
<span class='pageno' title='687' id='Page_687'></span>
Ribbentrop had had a talk with the Chancellor only yesterday.
He stated that the Chancellor was still in favor of
good relations with Poland, and had expressed a desire to
have a thorough conversation with you on the subject of
our mutual relations. M. von Ribbentrop indicated that
he was under the impression that difficulties arising between
us were also due to some misunderstanding of the
Reich’s real aims. The problem needed to be considered
on a higher plane. In his opinion our two States were dependent
on each other.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I [Lipski] stated that now, during the settlement of the
Czechoslovakian question, there was no understanding whatever
between us. The Czech issue was already hard enough
for the Polish public to swallow, for, despite our disputes
with the Czechs they were after all a Slav people. But in
regard to Slovakia the position was far worse. I emphasized
our community of race, language and religion, and
mentioned the help we had given in their achievement of
independence. I pointed out our long frontier with Slovakia.
I indicated that the Polish man in the street could not understand
why the Reich had assumed the protection of Slovakia,
that protection being directed against Poland. I said emphatically
that this question was a serious blow to our
relations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Ribbentrop reflected a moment, and then answered that
this could be discussed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I promised to refer to you the suggestion of a conversation
between you and the Chancellor. Ribbentrop remarked that
I might go to Warsaw during the next few days to talk over
this matter. He advised that the talk should not be delayed,
lest the Chancellor should come to the conclusion that
Poland was rejecting all his offers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Finally, I asked whether he could tell me anything about
his conversation with the Foreign Minister of Lithuania.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Ribbentrop answered vaguely that he had seen Mr. Urbszys
on the latter’s return from Rome, and they had discussed
the Memel question, which called for a solution.” (<span class='it'>TC-73
No. 61</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That conversation took place on 21 March. The world soon
learned what the solution to Memel was. On the next day German
armed forces marched in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of these events, considerable anxiety was growing
both in the government of Great Britain and the Polish government,
<span class='pageno' title='688' id='Page_688'></span>
and the two governments therefore had been undertaking
conversations between each other. On 31 March, the Prime
Minister, Mr. Chamberlain, spoke in the House of Commons.
He explained the results of the conversations that had been
taking place between the British and Polish Governments:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As the House is aware, certain consultations are now
proceeding with other governments. In order to make perfectly
clear the position of His Majesty’s government in
the meantime before those consultations are concluded, I now
have to inform the House that during that period, in the
event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence,
and which the Polish government accordingly
considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His
Majesty’s government would feel themselves bound at once
to lend the Polish government all support in their power.
They have given the Polish government an assurance to this
effect.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I may add that the French government have authorized me
to make it plain that they stand in the same position in this
matter as do His Majesty’s Government.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 17</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 6 April, a week later, a formal communique was issued by
the Anglo-Polish governments, which repeated the assurance the
Prime Minister had given a week before, and in which Poland
assured Great Britain of her support should Great Britain be attacked.
(<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 18</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The anxiety and concern that the governments of Poland and
Great Britain were feeling at that time appears to have been
justified. During the same week, on 3 April, an order, signed
by Keitel, emanated from the High Command of the Armed
Forces. It is dated Berlin, 3 April 1939. The subject is “Directive
for the Armed Forces 1939/40.” The order reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Directive for the uniform preparation of war by the Armed
Forces for 1939/40 is being reissued.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Part I (Frontier Defense) and Part III (Danzig) will be issued
in the middle of April. Their basic principles remain
unchanged.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Part II ‘<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>’ [the code name for the operation against
Poland] is attached herewith. The signature of the Fuehrer
will be appended later.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer has added the following Directives to ‘<span class='it'>Fall
Weiss</span>’:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Preparations must be made in such a way that the operations
can be carried out at any time from 1st September 1939
onwards.
<span class='pageno' title='689' id='Page_689'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The High Command of the Armed Forces has been directed
to draw up a precise timetable for ‘<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>’ and
to arrange by conferences the synchronized timings between
the three branches of the armed forces.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The plan of the branches of the Armed Forces and the
details for the timetable must be submitted to the OKW
by the 1st of May, 1939.” (C-120)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This order was distributed to the OKH, OKM, and OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another document, dated 11 April, and signed by Hitler, is annexed.
It reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I shall lay down in a later directive the future tasks of the
Armed Forces and the preparations to be made in accordance
with these for the conduct of the war.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Until that directive comes into force, the Armed Forces
must be prepared for the following eventualities:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I. Safeguarding the frontiers of the German Reich, and
protection against surprise air attacks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“II. ‘<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>’.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“III. The annexation of Danzig.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Annex IV contains regulations for the exercise of military
authority in East Prussia in the event of a warlike development.”
(<span class='it'>C-120</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again, copies of that document went to the OKH, OKM, and
OKW. Annex I to this order, which concerns the safeguarding
of the frontiers of the German Reich, declares:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Legal Basis: It should be anticipated that a state
of Defense or State of War, as defined in the Reichdefense
law of the 4th of September 1938, will not be declared. All
measures and demands necessary for carrying out a mobilization
are to be based on the laws valid in peacetime.”
(<span class='it'>C-120</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The statement of the Prime Minister in the House of Commons,
followed by the Anglo-Polish communique of 6 April, was seized
upon by the Nazi government to urge on the crisis which they
were developing in Danzig between themselves and Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 28 April the German government issued a memorandum in
which they alleged that the Anglo-Polish declaration was incompatible
with the 1934 Agreement between Poland and Germany,
and that as a result of entering into or by reason of entering
into that agreement, Poland had unilaterally renounced the 1934
agreement. The following are pertinent passages from that
memorandum:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German government have taken note of the Polish-British
<span class='pageno' title='690' id='Page_690'></span>
declaration regarding the progress and aims of the
negotiations recently conducted between Poland and Great
Britain. According to this declaration there had been concluded
between the Polish government and the British government
a temporary understanding to be released shortly
by a permanent agreement which will provide for the giving
of mutual assistance by Poland and Great Britain in the event
of the independence of one of the two states being directly
or indirectly threatened.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 14</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The memorandum goes on to set out in the next three paragraphs
the history of German friendship towards Poland. It
continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The agreement which has now been concluded by
the Polish government with the British government is in
such obvious contradiction to these solemn declarations of
a few months ago that the German government can take
note only with surprise and astonishment of such a violent
reversal of Polish policy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Irrespective of the manner in which its final formulation
may be determined by both parties, the new Polish-British
agreement is intended as a regular Pact of Alliance, which,
by reason of its general sense and of the present state of
political relations, is directed exclusively against Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“From the obligation now accepted by the Polish government,
it appears that Poland intends, in certain circumstances,
to take an active part in any possible German-British
conflict, in the event of aggression against Germany, even
should this conflict not affect Poland and her interests. This
is a direct and open blow against the renunciation of all use
of force contained in the 1934 declaration.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Polish government, however, by their recent decision
to accede to an alliance directed against Germany have given
it to be understood that they prefer a promise of help by a
third power to the direct guarantee of peace by the German
government. In view of this, the German government are
obliged to conclude that the Polish government do not at
present attach any importance to seeking a solution of German-Polish
problems by means of direct, friendly discussion
with the German government. The Polish government have
thus abandoned the path traced out in 1934 to the shaping of
German-Polish relations.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 14</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>All this would sound very well, if it had not been for the fact
that orders for the invasion of Poland had already been issued
<span class='pageno' title='691' id='Page_691'></span>
and the Armed Forces had been told to draw up a precise timetable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The memorandum goes on to set out the history of the last
negotiations and discussions. It sets out the demands of the
21st which the German government had made for the return of
Danzig, the autobahn, and the railway. It mentions the promise
by Germany of the twenty-five year guarantee, and continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Polish government did not avail themselves of the opportunity
offered to them by the German government for a
just settlement of the Danzig question; for the final safeguarding
of Poland’s frontiers with the Reich and thereby
for permanent strengthening of the friendly, neighbourly
relations between the two countries. The Polish government
even rejected German proposals made with this object.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At the same time the Polish government accepted, with regard
to another state, political obligations which are not compatible
either with the spirit, the meaning or the text of the
German-Polish declaration of the 26 of January, 1934.
Thereby, the Polish government arbitrarily and unilaterally
rendered this declaration null and void.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 14</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In the last paragraph the German government says, that nevertheless,
they are prepared to continue friendly relations with
Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the same day that memorandum was issued, 28 April, Hitler
made a speech in the Reichstag, in which he repeated, in effect,
the terms of the memorandum. He repeated the demands
and offers that Germany made in March, and went on to say that
the Polish government have rejected his offer. He expressed
his disappointment:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have regretted greatly this incomprehensible attitude of
the Polish government. But that alone is not the decisive
fact. The worst is that now Poland, like Czechoslovakia, a
year ago, believes under the pressure of a lying international
campaign, that it must call up troops although Germany,
on her part, has not called up a single man and had
not thought of proceeding in any way against Poland. As I
have said, this is, in itself, very regrettable and posterity
will one day decide whether it was really right to refuse the
suggestion made this once by me. This, as I have said, was
an endeavor on my part to solve a question which intimately
affects the German people, by a truly unique compromise and
to solve it to the advantage of both countries. According to
my conviction, Poland was not a giving party in this solution
at all, but only a receiving party, because it should be beyond
<span class='pageno' title='692' id='Page_692'></span>
all doubt, that Danzig will never become Polish. The intention
to attack on the part of Germany, which was merely invented
by the International Press, led, as you know, to the
so-called guarantee offer, and to an obligation on the part of
the Polish government for mutual assistance. * * *”
(<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 13</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The speech demonstrates how completely dishonest was everything
that the German government was saying at that time.
Hitler, who may very well have had a copy of the orders for “<span class='it'>Fall
Weiss</span>” in his pocket as he spoke, announced publicly, that the
intention to attack by Germany was an invention of “the International
Press.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In answer to that memorandum and that speech, the Polish
government issued a memorandum on 5 May. It sets out the objectives
of the 1934 agreement to renounce the use of force and
to carry on friendly relationship between the two countries; to
solve difficulties by arbitration and other friendly means. The
Polish government states its awareness of the difficulties about
Danzig and declares that it has long been ready to carry out discussions.
The Polish government sets out again its part of the
recent discussions. The Polish government states that it communicated
its views to the German government on 26 March, and
that it then proposed joint guarantees by the Polish and German
governments of the City of Danzig, based on the principles of
freedom for the local population in internal affairs. The Poles
stated their preparedness to examine the possibilities of a motor
road and railway facilities. They received no reply to those proposals.
The Polish position is summarized in one sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is clear that negotiations in which one State formulates
demands and the other is to be obliged to accept those demands
unaltered are not negotiations in the spirit of the
declaration of 1934 and are incompatible with the vital interests
and dignity of Poland” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 16</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Polish government proceeds to reject the German accusation
that the Anglo-Polish agreement is incompatible with the
1934 German-Polish agreement. It states that Germany herself
has entered into similar agreements with other nations, and lastly
it announces that it is still willing to entertain a new pact with
Germany, should Germany wish to do so. (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 16</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German answer was contained in a letter from the Supreme
Commander of the Armed Forces, is signed by Hitler, and
dated 10 May (<span class='it'>C-120</span>). Copies went to the various branches of
the OKW, and with them apparently were enclosed “Instructions
for the economic war and the protection of our own economy.”
<span class='pageno' title='693' id='Page_693'></span>
Not only were military preparations being carried out throughout
these months and weeks, but economic and every other kind of
preparation was being made for war at the earliest moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This period of preparation, up to May 1939, concluded with the
conference in the Reichschancellery on 23 May. The report of
this meeting is known as the Schmundt Minutes (<span class='it'>L-79</span>). In his
address to the conference Hitler cried out for <span class='it'>lebensraum</span> and said
that Danzig was not the dispute at all. It was a question of expanding
their living room in the east, and he said that the decision
had been taken to attack Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering, Raeder and Keitel, among many others, were present.
The following is a significant paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If there were an alliance of France, England and Russia
against Germany, Italy and Japan, I would be constrained to
attack England and France with a few annihilating blows.
The Fuehrer doubts the possibility of a peaceful settlement
with England.” (<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>So that, not only has the decision been taken definitely to attack
Poland, but almost equally definitely to attack England and
France.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Final Preparations: June-September 1939</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Final Preparations of the Armed Forces.</span> A precise timetable
for the attack had been called for. On 22 June 1939 it was
ready. It provided as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Supreme Command of the Armed Forces has submitted
to the Fuehrer and Supreme Commander a ‘preliminary timetable’
for ‘<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>’ based on the particulars so far available
from the Navy, Army and Air Force. Details concerning
the days preceding the attack and the start of the attack
were not included in this timetable.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer and the Supreme Commander is, in the main,
in agreement with the intentions of the Navy, Army and Air
Force and made the following comments on individual
points:—</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. In order not to disquiet the population by calling up reserves
on a larger scale than usual for the maneuvers scheduled
for 1939, as is intended, civilian establishments, employers
or other private persons who make enquiries should
be told that men are being called up for the autumn maneuvers
and for the exercise units it is intended to form for these
maneuvers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is requested that directions to this effect be issued to
subordinate establishments.” (<span class='it'>C-126</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='694' id='Page_694'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>All this became relevant later, when the German government
made allegations of mobilization on the part of the Poles. This
order shows that in June the Germans were mobilizing, only doing
so secretly. The order continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For reasons of security the clearing of hospitals in the area
of the frontier which the Supreme Command of the Army
proposed should take place from the middle of July, must
not be carried out.” (<span class='it'>C-126</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The order is signed by Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short letter, dated 2 August, which is attached to that order,
reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Attached are Operational Directions for the employment of
U-Boats which are to be sent out to the Atlantic, by way of
precaution, in the event of the intention to carry out ‘<span class='it'>Fall
Weiss</span>’ remaining unchanged. F.O. U-Boats [Doenitz] is
handing in his Operation Orders by 12 August.” (<span class='it'>C-126</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another letter, dated 27 July, contains orders for the Air and
Sea Forces for the occupation of the German Free City of Danzig.
It provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces
has ordered the reunion of the German Free State of Danzig
with the Greater German Reich. The Armed Forces must
occupy the Danzig Free State immediately in order to protect
the German population. There will be no hostile intention
on the part of Poland so long as the occupation takes
place without the force of arms.” (<span class='it'>C-30</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The letter then sets out how the occupation is to be effected.
All this again becomes more relevant in the subsequent discussion
of the diplomatic action of the last few days before the war, when
Germany was making specious offers for the settlement of the
question by peaceful means. This letter is evidence that the decision
had been taken, and that nothing would change that decision.
During July, right up to the time of the war, steps were
being taken to arm the population of Danzig and to prepare them
to take part in the coming occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reports which were coming back almost daily during this
period from Mr. Shepherd, British Consul-General in Danzig, to
the British Foreign Minister, and published in the British Blue
Book, show the kind of thing that was happening. The report
dated 1 July 1939 reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Yesterday morning four German army officers in mufti arrived
here by night express from Berlin to organize Danzig
<span class='it'>Heimwehr</span>.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All approaches to hills and dismantled fort, which constitute
<span class='pageno' title='695' id='Page_695'></span>
a popular public promenade on western fringe of the
city, have been closed with barbed wire and ‘<span class='it'>verboten</span>’
notices.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The walls surrounding the shipyards bear placards: ‘Comrades
keep your mouths shut lest you regret consequence.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Master of British steamer ‘High Commissioner Wood’ whilst
he was roving Koenigsberg from 28th June to 30th June,
observed considerable military activity, including extensive
shipment of camouflaged covered lorries and similar material
by small coasting vessels. On 28th June four medium-sized
steamers, loaded with troops, lorries, field kitchens, etc., left
Koenigsberg, ostensibly returning to Hamburg after maneuvers,
but actually proceeding to Stettin.” (<span class='it'>TC-71</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And again, as another example, the report dated 10 July states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The same informant, whom I believe to be reliable, advises
me that on 8th July he personally saw about thirty military
lorries with East Prussian license numbers on the Bischofsberg,
where numerous field kitchens had been placed along
the hedges. There were also eight large anti-aircraft guns
in position, which he estimated as being of over 3-inch caliber,
and three six-barreled light anti-aircraft machine guns.
There were about 500 men drilling with rifles, and the whole
place is extensively fortified with barbed wire.” (<span class='it'>TC-71</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 12 and 13 August, when preparations were practically
complete, Hitler and Ribbentrop at last disclosed their intentions
to their allies, the Italians. It will be recalled that one
of the passages in Hitler’s speech on 23 May, in regard to the
proposed attack on Poland, had said, “Our object must be kept
secret even from the Italians and the Japanese.” (<span class='it'>L-79</span>). Now,
when the preparations were complete, Hitler disclosed his intentions
to his Italian comrades in the hope that they would join
him. Ciano was surprised at Hitler’s attempt to persuade the
Italians to come into the war with him. He had no idea, as he
said, of the urgency of the matter, and they are not prepared.
He therefore tried to dissuade Hitler from starting off until the
Duce could have a little more time to prepare himself. (<span class='it'>TC-77</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minutes of that meeting show quite clearly the German intention
to attack England and France ultimately, if not at the
same time as Poland. In trying to show the strength of Germany
and its certainty of winning the war as a means of persuading
the Italians to come in, Hitler declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“At sea, England had for the moment no immediate reinforcements
in prospect. Some time would elapse before any
of the ships now under construction could be taken into
<span class='pageno' title='696' id='Page_696'></span>
service. As far as the land army was concerned, after the
introduction of conscription 60,000 men had been called to
the colors. If England kept the necessary troops in her own
country she could send to France, at the most, two infantry
divisions and one armored division. For the rest she could
supply a few bomber squadrons but hardly any fighters since,
at the outbreak of war, the German Air Force would at
once attack England and the English fighters would be
urgently needed for the defense of their own country.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“With regard to the position of France, the Fuehrer said
that in the event of a general war, after the destruction of
Poland—which would not take long—Germany would be in
a position to assemble hundreds of divisions along the West
Wall and France would then be compelled to concentrate
all her available forces from the Colonies, from the Italian
frontier and elsewhere on her own Maginot Line, for the
life and death struggle which would then ensue. The Fuehrer
also thought that the French would find it no easier to
overrun the Italian fortifications than to overrun the West
Wall. Here Count Ciano showed signs of extreme doubt.
The Polish Army was most uneven in quality. Together
with a few parade divisions, there were large numbers of
troops of less value. Poland was very weak in anti-tank
and anti-aircraft defense and at the moment neither France
nor England could help her in this respect.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If, however, Poland were given assistance by the Western
powers, over a longer period, she could obtain these weapons
and German superiority would thereby be diminished. In
contrast to the fanatics of Warsaw and Cracow, the population
of their areas was different. Furthermore, it was
necessary to consider the position of the Polish State. Out
of 34 million inhabitants, one and one-half million were
German, about four million were Jews, and nine million
Ukrainians, so that genuine Poles were much less in number
than the total population and, as already said, their
striking power was not to be valued highly. In these circumstances
Poland could be struck to the ground by Germany
in the shortest time.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Since the Poles, through their whole attitude, had made it
clear that in any case in the event of a conflict they would
stand on the side of the enemies of Germany and Italy, a
quick liquidation at the present moment could only be of
advantage for the unavoidable conflict with the Western
Democracies. If a hostile Poland remained on Germany’s
<span class='pageno' title='697' id='Page_697'></span>
eastern frontier, not only would the eleven East Prussian
divisions be tied down, but also further contingents would
be kept in Pomerania and Silesia. This would not be necessary
in the event of a previous liquidation.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Coming back to the Danzig question, the Fuehrer said that
it was impossible for him now to go back. He had made an
agreement with Italy for the withdrawal of the Germans
from South Tyrol, but for this reason he must take the
greatest care to avoid giving the impression that this Tyrolese
withdrawal could be taken as a precedent for other
areas. Furthermore, he had justified the withdrawal by
pointing to a general easterly and northeasterly direction
of a German policy. The east and northeast, that is to say
the Baltic countries, had been Germany’s undisputed sphere
of influence since time immemorial, as the Mediterranean
had been an appropriate sphere for Italy. For economic
reasons also, Germany needed the foodstuffs and timber
from these eastern regions.” (<span class='it'>TC-77</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now the truth of this matter appears. It is not the persecution
of German minorities on the Polish frontiers, but economic
reasons—the need for foodstuffs and timber from Poland. The
minutes of the Italo-German meeting continue:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the case of Danzig, German interests were not only material,
although the city had the greatest harbour in the Baltic.
Danzig was a Nurnberg of the North, an ancient German
city awakening sentimental feelings for every German,
and the Fuehrer was bound to take account of this psychological
element in public opinion. To make a comparison with
Italy, Count Ciano should suppose that Trieste was in Yugoslav
hands and that a large Italian minority was being
treated brutally on Yugoslav soil. It would be difficult to
assume that Italy would long remain quiet over anything of
this kind.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Count Ciano, in replying to the Fuehrer’s statement, first
expressed the great surprise on the Italian side over the completely
unexpected seriousness of the position. Neither in the
conversations in Milan nor in those which took place during
his Berlin visit had there been any sign from the German
side that the position with regard to Poland was so serious.
On the contrary, Ribbentrop had said that in his opinion the
Danzig question would be settled in the course of time. On
these grounds, the Duce, in view of his conviction that a conflict
with the Western Powers was unavoidable, had assumed
<span class='pageno' title='698' id='Page_698'></span>
that he should make his preparations for this event; he had
made plans for a period of two or three years. If immediate
conflict were unavoidable, the Duce, as he had told Ciano,
would certainly stand on the German side, but for various
reasons he would welcome the postponement of a general
conflict until a later time.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Ciano then showed, with the aid of a map, the position of
Italy in the event of a general war. Italy believed that a
conflict with Poland would not be limited to that country
but would develop into a general European war.” (<span class='it'>TC-77</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter, Ciano tried to dissuade Hitler from any immediate
action. He argued further:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For these reasons the Duce insisted that the Axis Powers
should make a gesture which would reassure people of the
peaceful intentions of Italy and Germany.” (<span class='it'>TC-77</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Fuehrer’s answer was clear:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer answered that for a solution of the Polish
problem no time should be lost; the longer one waited until
the autumn, the more difficult would military operations in
Eastern Europe become. From the middle of September,
weather conditions made air operations hardly possible in
these areas, while the condition of the roads, which were
quickly turned into a morass by the autumn rains, would be
such as to make them impossible for motorized forces. From
September to May, Poland was a great marsh and entirely
unsuited for any kind of military operations. Poland could,
however, occupy Danzig in September and Germany would
not be able to do anything about it since they obviously
could not bombard or destroy the place.” (<span class='it'>TC-77</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Germans could not possibly bombard or destroy any place
such as Danzig where there happened to be Germans living. The
discussion continued:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ciano asked how soon, according to the Fuehrer’s view, the
Danzig question must be settled. The Fuehrer answered that
this settlement must be made one way or another by the end
of August. To the question of Ciano’s as to what solution
the Fuehrer proposed, Hitler answered that Poland must
give up political control of Danzig, but that Polish economic
interests would obviously be reserved and that Polish general
behavior must contribute to a general lessening of the
tension. He doubted whether Poland was ready to accept
this solution since, up to the present, the German proposals
had been refused. The Fuehrer had made this proposal personally
to Beck at his visit to Obersalzberg. They were extremely
<span class='pageno' title='699' id='Page_699'></span>
favorable to Poland. In return for the political surrender
of Danzig, under a complete guarantee of Polish interests
and the establishment of a connection between East
Prussia and the Reich, Germany would have given a frontier
guarantee, a 25-year pact of friendship and the participation
of Poland in influence over Slovakia. Beck had
received the proposal with the remark that he was willing to
examine it. The plain refusal of it came only as a result of
English intervention. The general Polish aims could be seen
clearly from the press. They wanted the whole of East Prussia,
and even proposed to advance to Berlin.” (<span class='it'>TC-77</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The meeting was held over that night, and it continued on the
following day:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer had therefore come to two definite conclusions:
(1) in the event of any further provocation, he would immediately
attack; (2) if Poland did not clearly and plainly
state her political intention, she must be forced to do so.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As matters now stand, Germany and Italy would simply
not exist further in the world through lack of space; not
only was there no more space, but existing space was completely
blockaded by its present possessors; they sat like misers
with their heaps of gold and deluded themselves about
their riches. The Western Democracies were dominated by
the desire to rule the world and would not regard Germany
and Italy as their class. This psychological element of contempt
was perhaps the worst thing about the whole business.
It could only be settled by a life and death struggle which the
two Axis partners could meet more easily because their interests
did not clash on any point.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Mediterranean was obviously the most ancient domain
for which Italy had a claim to predominance. The Duce
himself had summed up the position to him in the words
that Italy already was the dominant power in the Mediterranean.
On the other hand, the Fuehrer said that Germany
must take the old German road eastwards and that this road
was also desirable for economic reasons, and that Italy had
geographical and historical claims to permanency in the
Mediterranean. Bismarck had recognized it and had said as
much in his well-known letter to Mazzini. The interests of
Germany and Italy went in quite different directions and
there never could be a conflict between them.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Ribbentrop added that if the two problems mentioned in
yesterday’s conversations were settled, Italy and Germany
<span class='pageno' title='700' id='Page_700'></span>
would have their backs free for work against the West. The
Fuehrer said that Poland must be struck down so that for 50
years she would be incapable of fighting. In such a case,
matters in the West could be settled.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Ciano thanked the Fuehrer for his extremely clear explanation
of the situation. He had, on his side, nothing to add
and would give the Duce full details. He asked for more
definite information on one point in order that the Duce
might have all the facts before him. The Duce might indeed
have to make no decision because the Fuehrer believed
that the conflict with Poland could be localized on the basis
of long experience. He—Ciano—quite saw that so far the
Fuehrer had always been right in his judgment of the position.
If, however, Mussolini had no decision to make, he had
to take certain measures of precaution, and therefore Ciano
would put the following question:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer had mentioned two conditions under which he
would take Poland (1) if Poland were guilty of serious provocation,
and (2) if Poland did not make her political position
clear. The first of these conditions depended on the decision
of the Fuehrer, and German reaction could follow it in a
moment. The second condition required certain decisions as
to time. Ciano therefore asked what was the date by which
Poland must have satisfied Germany about her political
condition. He realized that this date depended upon climatic
conditions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer answered that the decision of Poland must be
made clear at the latest by the end of August. Since, however,
the decisive part of military operations against Poland
could be carried out within a period of 14 days and the final
liquidation would need another four weeks, it could be finished
at the end of September or the beginning of October.
These could be regarded as the dates. It followed, therefore,
that the last dates on which he could begin to take action
was the end of August.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Finally, the Fuehrer assured Ciano that since his youth he
had favored German-Italian cooperation, and that no other
view was expressed in his books. He had always thought
that Germany and Italy were naturally suited for collaboration,
since there were no conflicts of interest between them.
He was personally fortunate to live at a time in which, apart
from himself, there was one other statesman who would stand
out great and unique in history; that he could be this man’s
friend was for him a matter of great personal satisfaction,
<span class='pageno' title='701' id='Page_701'></span>
and if the hour of common battle struck, he would always be
found on the side of the Duce.” (<span class='it'>TC-77</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Economic Preparations.</span> If the military preparations were
throughout this period nearing their completion, at the same
time the economists had not been idle. A letter dated 25 August
1939, from Funk to the Feuhrer, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“My Fuehrer!</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I thank you sincerely and heartily for your most friendly
and kind wishes on the occasion of my birthday. How happy
and how grateful to you we ought to be for being granted
the favor of experiencing these overwhelmingly great and
world-changing times and taking part in the mighty events
of these days.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The information given to me by Field Marshal Goering, that
you, my Fuehrer, yesterday evening approved in principle
the measures prepared by me for financing the war and for
shaping the relationship between wages and prices and for
carrying through emergency sacrifices, made me deeply
happy. I hereby report to you with all respect that I have
succeeded by means of precautions taken during the last few
months, in making the Reichsbank internally so strong and
externally so unassailable, that even the most serious shocks
in the international money and credit market cannot affect
us in the least. In the meantime I have quite inconspicuously
changed into gold all the assets of the Reichsbank and
of the whole of German economy abroad which it was possible
to lay hands on. Under the proposals I have prepared for a
ruthless elimination of all consumption which is not of vital
importance and of all public expenditure and public works
which are not of importance for the war effort, we will be in
a position to cope with all demands on finance and economy,
without any serious shocks. I have considered it my duty as
the General Plenipotentiary for Economy appointed by you
to make this report and solemn promise to you, my Fuehrer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Heil my Fuehrer&nbsp;&nbsp;/signed/&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter Funk.” (<span class='it'>699-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult in view of that letter to see how Funk can claim
that he did not know of the preparations and of the intentions
of the German government to wage war.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Obersalzburg Speech.</span> On 22 August 1939, Hitler addressed
his commanders in chief at Obersalzburg. (<span class='it'>1014-PS</span>). At
this date preparations were complete. In the course of his speech
Hitler declared:
<span class='pageno' title='702' id='Page_702'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Everybody shall have to make a point of it that we were
determined from the beginning to fight the Western powers.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Destruction of Poland in the foreground. The aim is elimination
of living forces, not the arrival at a certain line.
Even if war should break out in the West, the destruction
of Poland shall be the primary objective.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I shall give a propagandistic cause for starting the war—never
mind whether it be plausible or not. The victor shall
not be asked later on whether we told the truth or not. In
starting and making a war, not the Right is what matters
but Victory.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It was clear to me that a conflict with Poland had to come
sooner or later. I had already made this decision in spring,
but I thought that I would first turn against the West in a
few years, and only afterwards against the East.” (<span class='it'>1014-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These passages emphasize the intention of the Nazi government
not only to conquer Poland but ultimately, in any event, to
wage aggressive war against the Western Democracies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another significant passage, Hitler stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We need not be afraid of a blockade. The East will supply
us with grain, cattle, coal, lead and zinc. It is a big arm,
which demands great efforts. I am only afraid that at the
last minute some <span class='it'>Schweinehund</span> will make a proposal for
mediation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The political arm is set farther. A beginning has been made
for the destruction of England’s hegemony. The way is open
for the soldier, after I have made the political preparations.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Goering answers with thanks to the Fuehrer and the assurance
that the armed forces will do their duty.” (<span class='it'>798-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Diplomatic Preparations: Provoking the Crisis.</span> On 23
August 1939, the Danzig Senate passed a decree whereby Gauleiter
Forster was appointed head of the State of the Free City
of Danzig, a position which did not exist under the statute setting
up the constitution of the Free City. (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 62</span>). That event
was, of course, aimed at stirring up feeling in the Free City at
that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time, frontier incidents were being manufactured
by the Nazi Government with the aid of the SS. The affidavit
of General Lahousen (<span class='it'>Affidavit A</span>) refers to the provision of
<span class='pageno' title='703' id='Page_703'></span>
Polish uniforms to the SS Forces for these purposes, so that dead
Poles could be found lying about on the German side of the frontier.
Three short reports found in the British Blue Book corroborate
this affidavit. They are reports from the British ambassador
in Warsaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first of them is dated 26 August, and reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Series of incidents again occurred yesterday on German
frontier.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Polish patrol met party Germans one kilometre from East
Prussian frontier near Pelta. Germans opened fire. Polish
patrol replied, killing leader, whose body is being returned.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“German bands also crossed Silesian frontier near Szczyglo,
twice near Rybnik and twice elsewhere, firing shots and attacking
blockhouses and customs posts with machine guns
and hand grenades. Poles have protested vigorously to
Berlin.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Gazeta Polska</span>, in inspired leader, today says these are more
than incidents. They are clearly prepared acts of aggression
of para-military disciplined detachments supplied with regular
army’s arms, and in one case it was a regular army detachment.
Attacks more or less continuous.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“These incidents did not cause Poland to forsake calm and
strong attitude of defence. Facts spoke for themselves and
acts of aggression came from German side. This was best
answer to ravings of German press.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Ministry for Foreign Affairs state uniformed German detachment
has since shot Pole across frontier and wounded
another.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 53</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next report is dated the same date, 26 August and reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ministry for Foreign Affairs categorically deny story recounted
by Herr Hitler to French Ambassador that twenty-four
Germans were recently killed at Lodz and eight at Bielsko.
Story is without any foundation whatever.” (<span class='it'>TC-72
No. 54</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The report of the next day, 27 August, reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“So far as I can judge, German allegations of mass ill-treatment
of German minority by Polish authorities are gross
exaggeration, if not complete falsification.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. There is no sign of any loss of control of situation by
Polish civil authorities. Warsaw, and so far as I can ascertain,
the rest of Poland is still completely calm.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Such allegations are reminiscent of Nazi propaganda
methods regarding Czechoslovakia last year.
<span class='pageno' title='704' id='Page_704'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. In any case it is purely and simply deliberate German
provocation in accordance with fixed policy that has since
March [when the rest of Czechoslovakia was seized] exacerbated
feeling between the two nationalities. I suppose this
has been done with object (a) creating war spirit in Germany
(b) impressing public opinion abroad (c) provoking
either defeatism or apparent aggression in Poland.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. It has signally failed to achieve either of the two latter
objects.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“6. It is noteworthy that Danzig was hardly mentioned by
Herr Hitler.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“7. German treatment of Czech Jews and Polish minority
is apparently negligible factor compared with alleged sufferings
of Germans in Poland where, be it noted, they do
not amount to more than 10 per cent of population in any
commune.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“8. In face of these facts it can hardly be doubted that, if
Herr Hitler decided on war, it is for the sole purpose of
destroying Polish independence.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“9. I shall lose no opportunity of impressing on Minister for
Foreign Affairs necessity of doing everything possible to
prove that Herr Hitler’s allegations regarding German minority
are false.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 55</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Further corroboration of General Lahousen’s affidavit is contained
in a memorandum of a conversation between the writer and
Keitel. That conversation with Keitel took place on 17 August,
and went as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I reported my conference with Jost to Keitel. He said that
he would not pay any attention to this action, as the Fuehrer
had not informed him, and had only let him know that we
were to furnish Heydrich with Polish uniforms. He agrees
that I instruct the General Staff. He says that he does not
think much of actions of this kind. However, there is nothing
else to be done if they have been ordered by the Fuehrer,
that he could not ask the Fuehrer how he had planned the
execution of this special action. In regard to Dirschau, he
has decided that this action would be executed only by the
Army.” (<span class='it'>795-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That was the position at the end of the third week in August
1939. On 22 August the Russian-German Non-aggression Pact
was signed in Moscow. The orders to invade Poland were given
immediately after the signing of that treaty, and the H-hour was
actually to be in the early morning of 25 of August.
<span class='pageno' title='705' id='Page_705'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Pleas for peace.</span> On the same date, 22 August, news
reached England that the German-Russian agreement was being
signed. The significance of that pact from a military point of view
as to Germany was obvious, and the British government immediately
made their position clear in one last hope, that the German
government might possibly think better. The Prime Minister
wrote to Hitler as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Your Excellency.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Your Excellency will have already heard of certain measures
taken by His Majesty’s Government, and announced in
the press and on the wireless this evening.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“These steps have, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government,
been rendered necessary by the military movements
which have been reported from Germany, and by the fact
that apparently the announcement of a German-Soviet Agreement
is taken in some quarters in Berlin to indicate that intervention
by Great Britain on behalf of Poland is no longer
a contingency that need be reckoned with. No greater mistake
could be made. Whatever may prove to be the nature
of the German-Soviet Agreement, it can not alter Great
Britain’s obligation to Poland, which His Majesty’s Government
have stated in public repeatedly and plainly, and which
they are determined to fulfill.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It has been alleged that, if His Majesty’s Government had
made their position clear in 1914, the great catastrophe
would have been avoided. Whether or not there is any force
in that allegation, His Majesty’s Government are resolved
that on this occasion there shall be no such tragic misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If the case should arise, they are resolved, and prepared, to
employ without delay all the forces at their command, and it
is impossible to foresee the end of hostilities once engaged.
It would be a dangerous illusion to think that, if war once
starts, it will come to an early end even if a success on any one
of the several fronts on which it will be engaged should have
been secured.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 56</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Prime Minister therefore urged the German government to
try to solve the difficulty without recourse to the use of force. He
suggested that a truce should be declared while direct discussions
between the two governments, Polish and German, might take
place. Prime Minister Chamberlain concluded:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“At this moment I confess I can see no other way to avoid a
catastrophe that will involve Europe in war. In view of the
grave consequences to humanity, which may follow from the
<span class='pageno' title='706' id='Page_706'></span>
action of their rulers, I trust that Your Excellency will weigh
with the utmost deliberation the considerations which I have
put before you.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 56</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the following day, 23 August, Hitler replied to Prime Minister
Chamberlain. He started off by saying that Germany has
always sought England’s friendship, and went on to say that Germany,
“like every other State, possesses certain definite interests
which it is impossible to renounce.” The letter continued as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany was prepared to settle the questions of Danzig,
and of the Corridor by the method of negotiation on the basis
of a proposal of truly unparalleled magnanimity. The allegations
disseminated by England regarding a German mobilization
against Poland, the assertion of aggressive designs towards
Roumania, Hungary, etc., as well as the so-called guarantee
declarations, which were subsequently given, had, however,
dispelled Polish inclination to negotiate on a basis of
this kind which would have been tolerable for Germany also.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The unconditional assurance given by England to Poland
that she would render assistance to that country in all circumstances
regardless of the causes from which a conflict
might spring, could only be interpreted in that country as an
encouragement thenceforward to unloosen, under cover of
such a charter, a wave of appalling terrorism against the one
and a half million German inhabitants living in Poland.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The atrocities which then have been taking place in that
country are terrible for the victims, but intolerable for a
great power such as the German Reich, which is expected to
remain a passive onlooker during these happenings. Poland
has been guilty of numerous breaches of her legal obligations
towards the Free City of Danzig, has made demands in the
character of ultimata, and has initiated a process of economic
strangulation.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany will not tolerate a continuance of the persecution
of the Germans.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Reich government has received information to
the effect that the British government has the intention to
carry out measures of mobilization which, according to the
statements contained in your own letter, are clearly directed
against Germany alone. This is said to be true of France as
well. Since Germany has never had the intention of taking
military measures other than those of a defensive character
<span class='pageno' title='707' id='Page_707'></span>
against England, or France, and, as has already been emphasized,
has never intended, and does not in the future intend,
to attack England, or France, it follows that this announcement,
as confirmed by you, Mr. Prime Minister, in your own
letter, can only refer to a contemplated act of menace directed
against the Reich. I, therefore, inform your Excellency that
in the event of these military announcements being carried
into effect, I shall order immediate mobilization of the German
forces.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The question of the treatment of European problems on a
peaceful basis is not a decision which rests on Germany, but
primarily on those who since the crime committed by the
Versailles dictate have stubbornly and consistently opposed
any peaceful revision. Only after a change of spirit on the
part of the responsible powers can there be any real change
in the relationship between England and Germany. I have
all my life fought for Anglo-German friendship; the attitude
adopted by British diplomacy—at any rate up to the present—has,
however, convinced me of the futility of such an attempt.
Should there be any change in this respect in the
future, nobody could be happier than I.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 60</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 25 August the formal Anglo-Polish Agreement of Mutual
Assistance was signed in London. Each government undertook
to give assistance to the other in the event of aggression against
either by any third power. (<span class='it'>TC-73 No. 91</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later the French Prime Minister Daladier addressed
a letter to Hitler, which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The French ambassador in Berlin has informed me of your
personal communication * * *.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the hours in which you speak of the greatest responsibility
which two heads of the governments can possibly take
upon themselves, namely, that of shedding the blood of two
great nations, who long only for peace and work, I feel I owe
it to you personally, and to both our peoples to say that the
fate of peace still rests in your hands.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“You cannot doubt what are my own feelings towards Germany,
nor France’s peaceful feelings towards your nation. No
Frenchman has done more than myself to strengthen between
our two nations not only peace, but also sincere cooperation
in their own interests, as well as in those of Europe and of
the whole world. Unless you credit the French people with a
lower sense of honor, than I credit the German Nation with;
you cannot doubt that France loyally fulfills her obligations
<span class='pageno' title='708' id='Page_708'></span>
towards other powers, such as Poland, which as I am fully
convinced, wants to live in peace with Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“These two convictions are fully compatible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Till now there has been nothing to prevent a peaceful solution
of the international crisis, with all honor and dignity for
all nations, if the same will for peace exists on all sides.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Together with the good will of France I proclaim that of all
her allies. I take it upon myself to guarantee Poland’s readiness,
which she has always shown to submit to the mutual
application of a method of open settlement, as it can be imagined
between the governments of two sovereign nations. With
the clearest conscience I can assure you that among the differences
which have arisen between Germany and Poland
over, the question of Danzig, there is not one which could not
be submitted to such a method, the purpose of reaching a
peaceful and just solution.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Moreover, I can declare on my honor that there is nothing
in France’s clear and loyal solidarity with Poland and her
allies, which could in any way prejudice the peaceful attitude
of my country. This solidarity has never prevented us, and
does not prevent us today, from keeping Poland in the same
friendly state of mind.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In so serious an hour, I sincerely believe that no high-minded
human being could understand it, if a war of destruction
was started without a last attempt being made to reach
a peaceful settlement between Germany and Poland. Your
desire for peace could in all certainty work for this aim, without
any prejudice to German honor. I, who desire good harmony
between the French and the German people, and who
am on the other hand bound to Poland by bonds of friendship,
and by a promise, am prepared, as head of the French
government, to do everything an upright man can do to bring
this attempt to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“You and I were in the trenches in the last war. You know,
as I do, what horror and condemnation the devastations of
that war have left in the conscience of the peoples; without
any regard to its outcome. The picture I can see in my mind’s
eye of your outstanding role as the leader of the German
people on the road of peace, towards the fulfillment of its task
in the common work of civilization, leads me to ask for a reply
to this suggestion.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If French and German blood should be shed again, as it was
shed 25 years ago, in a still longer and more murderous war,
then each of the two nations will fight, believing in its own
<span class='pageno' title='709' id='Page_709'></span>
victory. But the most certain victors will be—destruction
and barbarity.” (<span class='it'>TC-78</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 27 August Hitler replied to M. Daladier’s letter of 26 August.
The sense of it was very much the same as that which he
wrote to the British Prime Minister in answer to the letter which
he had received from him earlier in the week. (<span class='it'>TC-79</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the letters from Chamberlain and Daladier, the German
Government could no longer be in any doubt as to the position
of both the British and French Governments in the event of German
aggression against Poland. But the pleas for peace did not
end there. On 24 August President Roosevelt wrote to both Hitler
and to the President of the Polish Republic (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 124</span>).
His letter stated in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the message which I sent to you on the 14th April, I
stated that it appeared to me that the leaders of great nations
had it in their power to liberate their peoples from the disaster
that impended, but that unless the effort were immediately
made with good will on all sides to find a peaceful and
constructive solution to existing controversies, the crisis
which the world was confronting must end in catastrophe.
Today that catastrophe appears to be very near at hand indeed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“To the message which I sent you last April I have received
no reply, but because my confident belief that the cause of
world peace—which is the cause of humanity itself—rises
above all other considerations, I am again addressing myself
to you, with the hope that the war which impends and the
consequent disaster to all peoples may yet be averted.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I therefore urge with all earnestness—and I am likewise
urging the President of the Republic of Poland—that the
Government of Germany and Poland agree by common accord
to refrain from any positive act of hostility for a reasonable
stipulated period, and that they agree, likewise by common
accord, to solve the controversies which have arisen between
them by one of the three following methods:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“First, by direct negotiation;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Second, by the submission of these controversies to an impartial
arbitration in which they can both have confidence;
or</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Third, that they agree to the solution of these controversies
through the procedure of conciliation.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 124</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s answer to that letter was the order to his armed forces
to invade Poland on the following morning. The reply to Mr.
<span class='pageno' title='710' id='Page_710'></span>
Roosevelt’s letter from the President of the Polish Republic, however,
was an acceptance of the offer to settle the differences by
any of the peaceful methods suggested. (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 126</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 25 August, no reply having been received from the German
Government, President Roosevelt wrote again:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have this hour received from the President of Poland a
reply to the message which I addressed to your Excellency
and to him last night.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Polish reply is then set out.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Your Excellency has repeatedly publicly stated that the aims
and objects sought by the German Reich were just and reasonable.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In his reply to my message the President of Poland has
made it plain that the Polish Government is willing, upon
the basis set forth in my message, to agree to solve the controversy
which has arisen between the Republic of Poland
and the German Reich by direct negotiation or the process
of conciliation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Countless human lives can yet be saved and hope may still
be restored that the nations of the modern world may even
now construct the foundation for a peaceful and happier relationship,
if you and the Government of the German Reich
will agree to the pacific means of settlement accepted by the
Government of Poland. All the world prays that Germany,
too, will accept.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 127</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But Germany would not accept those proposals, nor would it
pay heed to the Pope’s appeal on the same date, 24 August
(<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 139</span>). It is an appeal in similar terms. There was
yet a further appeal from the Pope on 31 August:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Pope is unwilling to abandon hope that pending negotiations
may lead to a just pacific solution such as the whole
world continues to pray for.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 141</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Those negotiations, on the last days of August, to which the
Pope referred as “pending negotiations”, were unhappily, completely
bogus negotiations insofar as Germany was concerned.
They were put forward simply as an endeavor to dissuade England,
either by threat or by bribe, from meeting her obligations
to Poland. The final German “offers” were no offers in the accepted
sense of the word. There was never any intention behind
them of entering into discussions, negotiation, arbitration, or any
other form of peaceful settlement with Poland. They were
merely an attempt to make it easier to seize and conquer Poland
than it would likely be if England and France were to observe
the obligations they had undertaken.
<span class='pageno' title='711' id='Page_711'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>Events of the Last Week in August, 1939.</span> This was the
progress of those last negotiations: On 22 August the German-Soviet
Pact was signed. On 24 August, orders were given to the
German armies to march the following morning. After those
orders had been given, the news apparently reached the German
Government that the British and Polish Governments had signed
a formal pact of nonaggression and of mutual assistance. Up
until that time, the position was that the British Prime Minister
had made a statement in the House of Commons and a joint communique
had been issued, on 6 April, that the two nations would
in fact assist one another if either were attacked; but no formal
agreement had been signed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, on 24 August, after the orders to march had been given
by Hitler, the news came that such a formal document had been
signed. The invasion was thereupon postponed for the sole purpose
of making one last effort to keep England and France out of
the war—not to cancel the war, but solely to keep England and
France out of it. On 25 August, having postponed the invasion,
Hitler issued a verbal communique to Sir Neville Henderson,
the British ambassador in Berlin, which was a mixture of bribe
and threat, and with which he hoped to persuade England to keep
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 28 August, Sir Neville Henderson handed the British Government’s
reply to that communique to Hitler. That reply stressed
that the differences ought to be settled by agreement. The British
Government put forward the view that Danzig should be guaranteed,
and that any agreement reached should be guaranteed
by other powers. Whether or not these proposals would have
been acceptable or unacceptable to Germany are of no great matter.
For once it had been made clear—as it was in the British
Government’s reply of 28 August—that England would not be
put off assisting Poland in the event of German aggression, the
German Government had no concern with further negotiation but
was concerned only to afford itself some kind of justification and
to prevent itself from appearing too blatantly to turn down all
the appeals to reason that were being put forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 29 August, at 7:15 p. m. in the evening, Hitler handed to
Sir Neville Henderson the German Government’s answer to the
British Government’s reply of the 28th. It seems quite clear that
the whole object of this letter was to put forward something
which was quite unacceptable. Hitler agreed to enter into direct
conversations as suggested by the British Government, but he
demanded that those conversations must be based upon the return
to the Reich, of Danzig and also of the whole of the Corridor.
<span class='pageno' title='712' id='Page_712'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be recalled that hitherto, even when he had alleged that
Poland had renounced the 1934 agreement, Hitler had put forward
as his demands the return of Danzig alone, plus the arrangement
for an extra-territorial Autobahn and railroad running
through the Corridor to East Prussia. That demand was unacceptable
at that time. To make quite certain of refusal, Hitler
now demanded the whole of the Corridor. There was no question
of an Autobahn or railway. The whole territory must become
German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even so, to make doubly certain that the offer would not be accepted,
Hitler stated: “On those terms I am prepared to enter
into discussion, but to do so, as the matter is urgent, I expect a
plenipotentiary with full powers from the Polish Government to
be here in Berlin by midnight tomorrow night, the 30th of
August.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This offer was made at 7:15 p. m. on the evening of the 29th.
That offer had to be transmitted, first, to London; and from London
to Warsaw; and from Warsaw the Polish Government had to
give authority to their Ambassador in Berlin. So that the timing
made it quite impossible, if indeed it were possible, to get authority
to the Polish Ambassador in Berlin by midnight the following
night. It allowed Poland no opportunity for discussing the matters
at all. As Sir Neville Henderson described it, the offer
amounted to an ultimatum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At midnight on 30 August, at the time by which the Polish
Plenipotentiary was expected to arrive, Sir Neville Henderson
handed a further message to Ribbentrop in reply to the message
that had been handed to him the previous evening. Ribbentrop
read out in German a two-&nbsp;or three-page document which purported
to be the German proposal to be discussed at the discussions
between them and the Polish Government. He read it out
quickly in German. He refused to hand a copy of it to the British
Ambassador. He passed no copy of it at all to the Polish
Ambassador. So that there was no kind of possible chance of the
Poles ever having before them the proposals which Germany was
so graciously and magnanimously offering to discuss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following day, 31 August, Mr. Lipski, the Polish Ambassador,
saw Ribbentrop, and could get no further than to be
asked whether he came with full powers. When he replied that
he did not, Ribbentrop said that he would put the position before
the Fuehrer. But, in actual fact, it was much too late to put any
position to the Fuehrer by that time, because on 31 August Hitler
had already issued his Directive No. 1 for the conduct of war,
in which he laid down H-Hour as being a quarter to five the following
<span class='pageno' title='713' id='Page_713'></span>
morning, 1 September. And on the evening of 31 August,
at 9 o’clock, the German radio broadcast the proposals which Ribbentrop
had read out to Sir Neville Henderson the night before,
saying that these were the proposals which had been made for
discussion, but that as no Polish Plenipotentiary had arrived to
discuss them, the German Government assumed that they were
turned down. That broadcast at 9 o’clock on the evening of 31
August was the first that the Poles had ever heard of the proposal,
and it was the first that the British Government or its representatives
in Berlin knew about them, other than what had been heard
when Ribbentrop had read them out and refused to give a written
copy on the evening of the 30th.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that broadcast, at 9:15—perhaps while the broadcast was
still in its course—a copy of those proposals was handed to Sir
Neville Henderson for the first time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This summary of events during that last week of August 1939
is based upon the contents of several documents which will now be
alluded to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a pre-trial interrogation on 29 August 1945, Goering was
asked the question:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When the negotiations of the Polish Foreign Minister in
London brought about the Anglo-Polish Treaty at the end
of March or the beginning of April, was it not fairly obvious
that a peaceful solution was impossible?” (<span class='it'>TC-90</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This was Goering’s answer:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Yes, it seemed impossible according to my conviction, but
not according to the convictions of the Fuehrer. When it
was mentioned to the Fuehrer that England had given her
guarantee to Poland, he said that England was also guaranteeing
Rumania, but then when the Russians took Bessarabia
nothing happened, and this made a big impression on him. I
made a mistake here. At this time Poland only had the
promise of a guarantee. The guarantee itself was only given
shortly before the beginning of the war. On the day when
England gave her official guarantee to Poland the Fuehrer
called me on the telephone and told me that he had stopped
the planned invasion of Poland. I asked him then whether
this was just temporary or for good. He said, ‘No, I will
have to see whether we can eliminate British intervention.’
So then I asked him, ‘Do you think that it will be any different
within four or five days?’ At this same time—I don’t
know whether you know about that, Colonel—I was in connection
with Lord Halifax by a special courier outside the
regular diplomatic channels to do everything to stop war
<span class='pageno' title='714' id='Page_714'></span>
with England. After the guarantee I held an English declaration
of war inevitable. I already told him in the Spring
of 1939 after occupying Czechoslovakia, I told him that from
now on if he tried to solve the Polish question he would have
to count on the enmity of England. 1939, that is after the
Protectorate.” (<span class='it'>TC-90</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The interrogation of Goering proceeded as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘Is it not a fact that preparations for the campaign
against Poland were originally supposed to have been
completed by the end of August 1939?’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘Yes.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘And that the final issuance of the order for the
campaign against Poland came some time between the 15th
and 20th of August 1939 after the signing of the treaty with
Soviet Russia.’ [The dates obviously are wrong].</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘Yes, that is true.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘Is it not also a fact that the start of the campaign
was ordered for the 25th of August, but on the 24th of
August in the afternoon it was postponed until September
the 1st in order to await the results of new diplomatic
maneuvers with the English Ambassador?’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘Yes.’ ” (<span class='it'>TC-90</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In this interrogation Goering purported not to have wanted war
with England. It will be recalled, however, that after the speech
of Hitler on 22 August to his commanders-in-chief, Goering got
up and thanked the Fuehrer for his exhortation and assured him
that the armed forces would play their part. (<span class='it'>798-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s verbal communique, as it is called in the British Blue
Book, which he handed to Sir Neville Henderson on 25 August,
after he had heard of the signing of the Anglo-Polish agreement,
in an endeavor to keep England from aiding Poland, commences
by stating Hitler’s desire to make one more effort to prevent war.
In the second paragraph he asserts again that Poland’s provocations
were unbearable:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany was in all circumstances determined to abolish
these Macedonian conditions on her eastern frontier and,
what is more, to do so in the interests of quiet and order,
but also in the interests of European peace.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The problem of Danzig and the Corridor must be solved.
The British Prime Minister had made a speech which was
not in the least calculated to induce any change in the German
attitude. At the most, the result of this speech could
be a bloody and incalculable war between Germany and
England. Such a war would be bloodier than that of 1914
<span class='pageno' title='715' id='Page_715'></span>
to 1918. In contrast to the last war, Germany would no
longer have to fight on two fronts. Agreement with Russia
was unconditional and signified a change in foreign policy of
the Reich which would last a very long time. Russia and
Germany would never again take up arms against each other.
Apart from this, the agreements reached with Russia would
also render Germany secure economically for the longest
period of war.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 68</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then comes the bribe.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer declared the German-Polish problem must be
solved and will be solved. He is however prepared and determined
after the solution of this problem to approach
England once more with a large, comprehensive offer. He
is a man of great decisions, and in this case also he will be
capable of being great in his action. And then magnanimously
he accepts the British Empire and is ready to pledge
himself personally for its continued existence and to place
the power of the German Reich at its disposal on condition
that his colonial demands, which are limited, should be negotiated
by peaceful means. * * *” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 68</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again Hitler stressed irrevocable determination never to enter
into war with Russia. He concluded as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If the British Government would consider these ideas a
blessing for Germany and also for the British empire, a
peace might result. If it rejects these ideas there will be
war. In no case will Great Britain emerge stronger; the
last war proved it. The Fuehrer repeats that he himself
is a man of ad infinitum decisions by which he is bound, and
that this is his last offer.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 68</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The British Government was not of course aware of the real
object that lay behind that message, and, taking it at its face
value, wrote back oh 28 August saying that they were prepared
to enter into discussions. They agreed with Hitler that the differences
must be settled, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government a reasonable
solution of the differences between Germany and Poland
could and should be effected by agreement between the two
countries on lines which would include the safeguarding of
Poland’s essential interests, and they recall that in his speech
of the 28th of April the German Chancellor recognized the
importance of these interests to Poland.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“But as was stated by the Prime Minister in his letter to the
German Chancellor of the 22nd of August, His Majesty’s
Government consider it essential for the success of the discussions
which would precede the agreement that it should be
<span class='pageno' title='716' id='Page_716'></span>
understood beforehand that any settlement arrived at would
be guaranteed by other powers. His Majesty’s Government
would be ready if desired to make their contribution to the
effective operation of such a guarantee.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“His Majesty’s Government have said enough to make their
own attitude plain in the particular matters at issue between
Germany and Poland. They trust that the German Chancellor
will not think that, because His Majesty’s Government
are scrupulous concerning their obligations to Poland, they
are not anxious to use all their influence to assist the achievement
of a solution which may commend itself both to Germany
and to Poland.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 74</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That reply knocked the German hopes on the head. The Nazis
had failed despite their tricks and their bribes to dissuade England
from observing her obligations to Poland, and it was now
only a matter of getting out of their embarrassment as quickly
as possible and saving face as much as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his interview with Hitler, Sir Neville Henderson emphasized
the British attitude that they were determined in any event to
meet their obligations to Poland. The interview concluded as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the end I asked him two straight questions: Was he
willing to negotiate direct with the Poles? and Was he ready
to discuss the question of any exchange of population? He
replied in the affirmative as regards the latter. There I
have no doubt that he was thinking at the same time of a
rectification of frontiers. As regards to the first, he said
he could not give me an answer until after he had given the
reply of His Majesty’s Government the careful consideration
which such a document deserved. In this connection he
turned to Ribbentrop and said, ‘We must summon Field Marshal
Goering to discuss it with him.’ ” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 75</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The German reply, as outlined before, was handed to Sir Neville
Henderson at 7.15 P. M. on 29 August. The reply sets out the
suggestion submitted by the British Government in a previous
note, and goes on to say that the German Government is prepared
to enter into discussion on the basis that the whole of the Corridor
as well as Danzig shall be returned to the Reich. The reply
continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The demands of the German Government are in conformity
with the revision of the Versailles Treaty in regard to this
territory which has always been recognized as being necessary;
viz., return of Danzig and the Corridor to Germany, the
<span class='pageno' title='717' id='Page_717'></span>
safeguarding of the existence of the German national group
in the territories remaining to Poland.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 78</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is only just now, as I emphasized before, that the right to
the Corridor has been “recognized” for so long. On 28 April, Hitler
demands consisted only of Danzig, the Autobahn, and the railway.
But now Hitler’s aim was to manufacture justification and
to put forth proposals which under no circumstances could either
Poland or Great Britain accept. The note states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The British Government attach importance to two considerations:
(1) that the existing danger of an imminent explosion
should be eliminated as quickly as possible by direct negotiation,
and (2) that the existence of the Polish State, in the
form in which it would then continue to exist, should be adequately
safeguarded in the economic and political sphere by
means of international guarantees.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On this subject, the German Government makes the following
declaration:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Though skeptical as to the prospects of a successful outcome,
they are nevertheless prepared to accept the English
proposal and to enter into direct discussions. They do so, as
has already been emphasized, solely as the result of the impression
made upon them by the written statement received
from the British Government that they too desire a pact of
friendship in accordance with the general lines indicated to
the British Ambassador.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For the rest, in making these proposals the German Government
have never had any intention of touching Poland’s
vital interests of questioning the existence of an independent
Polish State. The German Government, accordingly, in these
circumstances agree to accept the British Government’s offer
of their good offices in securing the despatch to Berlin of a
Polish Emissary with full powers. They count on the arrival
of this Emissary on Wednesday, the 30th August, 1939.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Government will immediately draw up proposals
for a solution acceptable to themselves and will, if possible,
place these at the disposal of the British Government
before the arrival of the Polish negotiators.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 78</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That was at 7:15 in the evening of 29 August. As previously
explained, insufficient time was allowed for the Polish Emissary
to reach Berlin by midnight the following night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Neville Henderson’s account of his interview on the evening
of 29 August summarizes what took place then:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I remarked that this phrase sounded like an ultimatum, but
<span class='pageno' title='718' id='Page_718'></span>
after some heated remarks both Herr Hitler and Herr von
Ribbentrop assured me that it was only intended to stress
urgency of the moment when the two fully mobilized armies
were standing face to face.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 79</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again the British Government replied and Sir Neville Henderson
handed this reply to Ribbentrop at the famous meeting on
midnight of 30 August, at the time the Polish Emissary had been
expected. The reply stated that the British Government reciprocated
the desire for improved relations. It stressed again that it
cannot sacrifice its interest to other friends in order to obtain an
improvement in the situation. It understood that the German
Government accepts the condition that the settlement should be
subject to international guarantee. The British Government
makes a reservation as to the demands that the Germans put forward
in their last letter, and is informing the Polish Government
immediately. Lastly, the British understand that the German
Government is drawing up the proposals. (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 89</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Neville Henderson gave this account of that interview at
midnight on 30 August:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I told Herr von Ribbentrop this evening that His Majesty’s
Government found it difficult to advise Polish Government to
accept procedure adumbrated in German reply, and suggested
that he should adopt normal contact, i.e., that when German
proposals were ready to invite Polish Ambassador to call and
to hand him proposals for transmission to his Government
with a view to immediate opening of negotiations. I added
that if basis afforded prospect of settlement His Majesty’s
Government could be counted upon to do their best in Warsaw
to temporize negotiations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Herr von Ribbentrop’s reply was to produce a lengthy document
which he read out in German aloud at top speed. Imagining
that he would eventually hand it to me I did not attempt
to follow too closely the sixteen or more articles which it contained.
Though I cannot therefore guarantee accuracy the
main points were: * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“When I asked Herr von Ribbentrop for text of these proposals
in accordance with undertaking the German reply of
yesterday, he asserted that it was now too late as Polish representative
had not arrived in Berlin by midnight.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I observed that to treat matter in this way meant that request
for Polish representative to arrive in Berlin on 30th
August constituted in fact, an ultimatum in spite of what he
and Herr Hitler had assured me yesterday. This he denied,
<span class='pageno' title='719' id='Page_719'></span>
saying that idea of an ultimatum was figment of my imagination.
Why then I asked could he not adopt normal procedure
and give me copy of proposals and ask Polish Ambassador
to call on him, just as Herr Hitler had summoned me
a few days ago, and hand them to him for communication to
Polish Government. In the most violent terms Herr von
Ribbentrop said that he would never ask the Ambassador to
visit him. He hinted that if Polish Ambassador asked him
for interview it might be different. I said that I would naturally
inform my Government so at once. Whereupon he said
while those were his personal views he would bring all that I
had said to Herr Hitler’s notice. It was for Chancellor to
decide.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We parted on that note, but I must tell you that Herr von
Ribbentrop’s demeanor during an unpleasant interview was
aping Herr Hitler at his worst. He inveighed incidentally
against Polish mobilization, but I retorted that it was hardly
surprising since Germany had also mobilized as Herr Hitler
himself had admitted to me yesterday.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 92</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Henderson of course did not know at that time that Germany
had also given the orders to attack Poland some days before. On
the following day, 31 August, at 6:30 in the evening, M. Lipski,
the Polish Ambassador, had an interview with Ribbentrop. This
is M. Lipski’s account of the conversation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I carried out my instructions. M. von Ribbentrop asked if
I had special plenipotentiary powers to undertake negotiations.
I said no. He then asked whether I had been informed
that on London’s suggestion the German Government had expressed
their readiness to negotiate directly with a delegate
of the Polish Government, furnished with the requisite full
powers, who was to have arrived on the preceding day, August
30. I replied that I had no direct information on the subject.
In conclusion M. von Ribbentrop repeated that he had
thought I would be empowered to negotiate. He would communicate
my demarche to the Chancellor.” (<span class='it'>TC-73 No. 112</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But it was too late. The orders had already been given on that
day to the German Army to invade. A “Most Secret order”
signed by Hitler, described as his “Direction No. 1 for the conduct
of the war,” dated 31 August 1939, reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Now that all the political possibilities of disposing by peaceful
means of a situation of the Eastern Frontier which is intolerable
for Germany are exhausted, I have determined on a
solution by force.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The attack on Poland is to be carried out in accordance with
<span class='pageno' title='720' id='Page_720'></span>
the preparations made for ‘<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>’, with the alterations
which result, where the Army is concerned, from the fact
that it has in the meantime almost completed its dispositions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Allotment of tasks and the operational target remain unchanged.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Date of attack—1 September 1939</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Time of attack—04:45 [inserted in red pencil]</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This time also applies to the operation at Gdynia, Bay of
Danzig and the Dirschau Bridge.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the West it is important that the responsibility for the
opening of hostilities should rest unequivocally with England
and France. At first purely local action should be taken
against insignificant frontier violations.” (<span class='it'>C-126</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That evening, 31 August, at nine o’clock, the German radio
broadcast the terms of the German proposals about which they
were willing to enter into discussions with the Polish Government.
The proposals were set out at length. By this time, neither Sir
Neville Henderson nor the Polish Government nor their Ambassador
had yet been given their written copy of them. This is a
document which seems difficult to explain other than as an exhibition
or an example of hypocrisy. The second paragraph states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Further, the German Government pointed out that they felt
able to make the basic points regarding the offer of an understanding
available to the British Government by the time
the Polish negotiator arrived in Berlin.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The manner in which they did that has been shown. The German
Broadcast continued, that instead of the arrival of an authorized
Polish personage, the first answer the Government of the
Reich received to their readiness for an understanding was the
news of the Polish mobilization; and that only toward 12 o’clock
on the night of 30 August 1939 did they receive a somewhat general
assurance of British readiness to help towards the commencement
of negotiations. The fact that the Polish negotiator expected
by the Reich did not arrive, removed the necessary conditions for
informing His Majesty’s Government of the views of the German
Government as regards the possible basis for negotiation. Since
His Majesty’s Government themselves had pleaded for direct negotiations
between Germany and Poland, the German Minister for
Foreign Affairs, Ribbentrop, gave the British Ambassador on the
occasion of the presentation of the last British note, precise information
as to the text of the German proposals which will be
regarded as a basis for negotiation in the event of the arrival of
the Polish Plenipotentiary. The Broadcast thereafter went on to
<span class='pageno' title='721' id='Page_721'></span>
set out the Nazi version of the story of the negotiations over the
last few days. (<span class='it'>TC-73 No. 113</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 1 September, when his armies were already crossing the
Polish frontier, Hitler issued this proclamation to his Armed
Forces:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Polish Government, unwilling to establish good neighborly
relations as aimed at by me, wants to force the issue by
way of arms.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Germans in Poland are being persecuted with bloody
terror and driven from their homes. Several acts of frontier
violation which cannot be tolerated by a great power show
that Poland is no longer prepared to respect the Reich’s frontiers.
To put an end to these mad acts I can see no other
way but from now onwards to meet force with force.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Armed Forces will with firm determination
take up the struggle for the honor and the vital rights of the
German people.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I expect every soldier to be conscious of the high tradition
of the eternal German soldierly qualities and to do his duty
to the last.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Remember always and in any circumstances that you are
the representatives of National Socialist Greater Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Long live our people and the Reich.” (<span class='it'>TC-54</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>So that at last Hitler had kept his word to his generals. He
had afforded them their propagandistic justification, and at that
time, anyway, it did not matter what people said about it afterwards.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The view shall not appear, asked later on, whether we told
the truth or not. Might is what counts—or victory is what
counts and not right.” (<span class='it'>1014-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On that day, 1 September, when news came of this invasion of
Polish ground, the British Government, in accordance with their
treaty obligations, sent an ultimatum to the German Government,
in which it stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I am accordingly to inform your Excellency that unless the
German Government are prepared to give His Majesty’s
Government satisfactory assurances that the German Government
have suspended all aggressive action against Poland
and are prepared promptly to withdraw their forces from
Polish territory, His Majesty’s Government in the United
Kingdom will without hesitation fulfill their obligations to
Poland.” (<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 110</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At 9 o’clock on 3 September the British Government handed a
<span class='pageno' title='722' id='Page_722'></span>
final ultimatum to the German Minister of Foreign Affairs. It
read in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Although this communication was made more
than twenty-four hours ago, no reply has been received but
German attacks upon Poland have been continued and intensified.
I have accordingly the honor to inform you that, unless
not later than eleven o’clock, British Summer Time, today
3d September, satisfactory assurances to the above effect
have been given by the German Government, and have
reached His Majesty’s Government in London, a state of war
will exist between the two countries as from that hour.”
(<span class='it'>TC-72 No. 118</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was that at 11 o’clock on 3 September a state of war
existed between Germany and England and between Germany and
France. The plans, preparations, intentions, and determination
to carry out this assault upon Poland which had been going on
for months, for years before, had come to fruition despite all appeals
to peace, all appeals to reason. It mattered not what anybody
but the German Government had in mind or whatever rights
anybody else but the German nation thought they had. If there
is any doubt left about this matter, two more documents remain
for consideration. Even now, on 3 September, Mussolini offered
some chance of peace. At 6:30 hours on 3 September Mussolini
sent a telegram to Hitler:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Italian Ambassador handed to the State Secretary at
the Duce’s order following copy for the Fuehrer and Reich
Chancellor and for the Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Italy sends the information, leaving, of course, every decision
to the Fuehrer, that it still has a chance to call a conference
with France, England and Poland on following basis:
1. Armistice which would leave the Army Corps where they
are at present. 2. Calling the conference within two or three
days. 3. Solution of the Polish-German controversy which
would be certainly favorable for Germany as matters stand
today.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This idea which originated from the Duce has its foremost
exponent in France.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Danzig is already German and Germany is holding already
securities which guarantee most of her demands. Besides,
Germany has had already its ‘moral satisfaction.’ If it would
accept the plan for a conference, it will achieve all her aims
and at the same time prevent a war which already today has
the aspect of being universal and of extremely long duration.”
(<span class='it'>1831-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='723' id='Page_723'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps even Mussolini did not appreciate what all Germany’s
aims were, for his offer was turned down in the illuminating letter
which Hitler was to write in reply:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Duce:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I first want to thank you for your last attempt at mediation.
I would have been ready to accept, but only under condition,
that there would be a possibility to give me certain guarantees
that the conference would be successful. Because, for
the last two days the German troops are engaged in an extraordinarily
rapid advance in Poland. It would have been
impossible to devaluate the bloody sacrifices made thereby
by diplomatic intrigues. Nevertheless, I believe that a way
could have been found, if England would not have been determined
to wage war under all circumstances. I have not
given in to the English, because, Duce, I do not believe that
peace could have been maintained for more than one-half
year or one year. Under these circumstances, I thought that,
in spite of everything, the present moment was better for
resistance. At present, the superiority of the German armed
forces in Poland is so overwhelming in all fields that the
Polish Army will collapse in a very short time. I doubt
whether this fast success could be achieved in one or two
years. England and France would have armed their allies,
to such an extent that the crushing technical superiority of
the German Armed Forces could not have become so apparent
anymore. I am aware, Duce, that the fight which I enter,
is one for life and death. My own fate does not play any
role in it at all. But I am also aware that one cannot avoid
such a struggle permanently and that one has to choose after
cold deliberation the moment for resistance in such a way
that the probability of the success is guaranteed and I believe
in this success, Duce, with the firmness of a rock. Recently
you have given me the kind assurance that you think
you will be able to help me in a few fields. I acknowledge
this in advance with, sincere thanks. But I believe also—even
if we march now over different roads—that fate will
finally join us. If the National Socialist Germany were destroyed
by the Western democracies, the Fascist Italy would
also have to face a grave future. I was personally always
aware of this community of the future of our two governments
and I know that you, Duce, think the same way. To
the situation in Poland, I would like to make the brief remark
that we lay aside, of course, all unimportant things,
that we do not waste any man in unimportant tasks, but direct
<span class='pageno' title='724' id='Page_724'></span>
all on acts in the light of great operational considerations.
The Northern Polish Army which is the Corridor, has
already been completely encircled by our action. It will be
either wiped out or will surrender. Otherwise, all operations
proceed according to plan. The daily achievements of the
troops are far beyond all expectations. The superiority of
our air force is complete, although scarcely one-third of it is
in Poland. In the West I will be on the defensive. France
can here sacrifice its blood first. Then the moment will come
when we can confront the enemy also there with the full
power of the nation. Accept my thanks, Duce, for all your
assistance which you have given to me in the past and I ask
you not to deny it to me in the future.” (<span class='it'>1831-PS</span>)</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg733a'>9. AGGRESSION AGAINST NORWAY AND DENMARK</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the early hours of the morning of 9 April 1940 Nazi Germany
invaded Norway and Denmark. Those invasions constituted
wars of aggression, and also wars in violation of international
treaties, agreements, and assurances.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Treaties and Assurances Violated.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The invasions constituted violations of the Hague Convention
and of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In addition there were specific
agreements between Germany and Norway and Denmark. There
was the Treaty of Arbitration and Conciliation between Germany
and Denmark, which was signed at Berlin on 2 June, 1926
(<span class='it'>TC-17</span>). The first Article of that Treaty is in these terms:
<span class='pageno' title='734' id='Page_734'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Contracting Parties undertake to submit to the procedure
of arbitration or conciliation, in conformity with the
present Treaty, all disputes of any nature whatsoever which
may arise between Germany and Denmark and which it has
not been possible to settle within a reasonable period by diplomacy
or to bring with the consent of both Parties before
the Permanent Court of International Justice.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Disputes for the solution of which a special procedure has
been laid down in other Conventions in force between the
Contracting Parties shall be settled in accordance with the
provisions of such Conventions.” (<span class='it'>TC-17</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The remaining Articles deal with the machinery for arbitration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was also the treaty of nonaggression between Germany
and Denmark which was signed by Ribbentrop on 31 May 1939,
ten weeks after the Nazi seizure of Czechoslovakia (<span class='it'>TC-24</span>). The
preamble and Articles 1 and 2 read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“His Majesty the King of Denmark and Iceland and the
Chancellor of the German Reich,</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Being firmly resolved to maintain peace between Denmark
and Germany in all circumstances, have agreed to confirm
this resolve by means of a treaty and have appointed as their
Plenipotentiaries: His Majesty the King of Denmark and
Iceland and the Chancellor of the German Reich.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article I: The Kingdom of Denmark and the German Reich
shall in no case resort to war or to any other use of force one
against the other.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Should action of the kind referred to in Paragraph 1 be
taken by a third Power against one of the Contracting Parties,
the other Contracting Party shall not support such action
in any way.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article II: The Treaty shall come into force on the exchange
of the instruments of ratification and shall remain in
force for a period of ten years from that date.” (<span class='it'>TC-24</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Treaty is dated 31 May 1939. At the bottom of the page
there appears the signature of Ribbentrop. The invasion of
Denmark by the Nazi forces less than a year after the signature
of this treaty showed the utter worthlessness of treaties to which
Ribbentrop put his signature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to Norway, Ribbentrop and the Nazi conspirators
were party to a similar perfidy. Hitler gave an assurance to Denmark,
Norway, and the Netherlands on 28 April 1939 (<span class='it'>TC-30</span>).
That, of course, was after the annexation of Czechoslovakia had
<span class='pageno' title='735' id='Page_735'></span>
shaken the confidence of the world, and was presumably an attempt
to try to reassure the Scandinavian States. Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have given binding declarations to a large number of
States. None of these States can complain that even a trace
of a demand contrary thereto has ever been made to them
by Germany. None of the Scandinavian statesmen, for example,
can contend that a request has ever been put to them
by the German Government or by the German public opinion
which was incompatible with the sovereignty and integrity
of their State.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I was pleased that a number of European States availed
themselves of these declarations by the German Government
to express and emphasize their desire too for absolute neutrality.
This applies to Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark,
etc.” (<span class='it'>TC-30</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A further assurance was given by the Nazi Government on 2
September 1939, the day after the Nazi invasion of Poland. On
that day an aide memoire was handed to the Norwegian Foreign
Minister by the German Minister in Oslo. It reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Reich Government is determined, in view of
the friendly relations which exist between Norway and Germany,
under no circumstances, to prejudice the inviolability
and integrity of Norway and to respect the territory of the
Norwegian State. In making this declaration the Reich Government
naturally expects, on its side, that Norway will observe
an unimpeachable neutrality towards the Reich and
will not tolerate any breaches of Norwegian neutrality by
any third party which might occur. Should the attitude of
the Royal Norwegian Government differ from this so that
any such breach of neutrality by a third party recurs, the
Reich Government would then obviously be compelled to safeguard
the interests of the Reich in such a way as the resulting
situation might dictate.” (<span class='it'>TC-31</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There followed a further German assurance to Norway in a
speech by Hitler on 6 October 1939 in which he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany has never had any conflicts of interest or even
points of controversy with the Northern States; neither has
she any today. Sweden and Norway have both been offered
nonaggression pacts by Germany and have both refused them
solely because they do not feel themselves threatened in any
way.” (<span class='it'>TC-32</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These treaties and assurances were the diplomatic background
to the Nazi aggression on Norway and Denmark. These assurances
<span class='pageno' title='736' id='Page_736'></span>
were simply given to lull suspicion and cause the intended
victims of Nazi aggression to be unprepared to meet the Nazi
attack. For it is now known that as early as October 1939 the
conspirators were plotting the invasion of Norway, and that the
most active conspirators in that plot were Raeder and Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Early Planning for Invasion.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Norwegian invasion is in one respect not a typical Nazi
aggression, in that Hitler had to be persuaded to embark upon it.
The chief instruments of persuasion were Raeder and Rosenberg;
Raeder because he thought Norway strategically important, and
because he coveted glory for his Navy; Rosenberg because of his
political connections in Norway, which he sought to develop. And
in the Norwegian, Vidkun Quisling, Rosenberg found a very model
of the Fifth Column agent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The early stages of the Nazi conspiracy to invade Norway are
disclosed in a letter which Raeder wrote on 10 January 1944 to
Admiral Assmann, the official German Naval historian (<span class='it'>C-66</span>).
It is headed “Memorandum for Admiral Assmann for his own information;
not to be used for publications.” The first part deals
with “Barbarossa” (the plan to invade Russia). The next part is
headed “(b) <span class='it'>Weseruebung</span>,” which was the code name for the invasion
of Norway and Denmark. The following is a pertinent
passage from the letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the weeks preceding the report on the 10th of October
1939, I was in correspondence with Admiral Carls, who,
in a detailed letter to me, first pointed out the importance of
an occupation of the Norwegian coast by Germany. I passed
this letter on to C/SKl (the Chief of Staff of the Naval War
Staff) for their information and prepared some notes based
on this letter for my report to the Fuehrer, which I made on
the 10th of October 1939, since my opinion was identical with
that of Admiral Carls, while at that time the SKl was more
dubious about the matter. In these notes, I stressed the disadvantages
which an occupation of Norway by the British
would have for us—control of the approaches to the Baltic,
outflanking of our naval operations and of air attacks on
Britain, pressure on Sweden. I also stressed the advantages
for us of the occupation of the Norwegian coast—outlet to
the North Atlantic, no possibility of a British mine barrier,
as in the year 1917-18. Naturally at the time, only the coast
and bases were considered; I included Narvik, though Admiral
Carls, in the course of our correspondence thought that
Narvik could be excluded. The Fuehrer saw at once the significance
<span class='pageno' title='737' id='Page_737'></span>
of the Norwegian problem; he asked me to leave the
notes and stated that he wished to consider the question himself.”
(<span class='it'>C-66</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This report of Raeder shows that the evolution of this Nazi
campaign against Norway affords a good example of the participation
of the German High Command in the Nazi conspiracy to
attack inoffensive neighbors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before this report of October 1939 was made to the Fuehrer,
Raeder sought a second opinion on the Norwegian invasion. On
3 October 1939, he made out a questionnaire headed, “Gaining of
Bases in Norway (extract from War Diary)” (<span class='it'>C-122</span>). It reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Chief of the Naval War Staff considers it necessary
that the Fuehrer be informed as soon as possible of the opinions
of the Naval War Staff on the possibilities of extending
the operational base to the North. It must be ascertained
whether it is possible to gain bases in Norway under the combined
pressure of Russia and Germany, with the aim of improving
our strategic and operational position. The following
questions must be given consideration:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>a</span>) What places in Norway can be considered as bases?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>b</span>) Can bases be gained by military force against Norway’s
will, if it is impossible to carry this out without fighting?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>c</span>) What are the possibilities of defense after the occupation?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>d</span>) Will the harbors have to be developed completely as
bases, or have they already advantages suitable for supply
position?”</p>

<p class='noindent'>”F.O.U.-boats” [a reference to Doenitz] “already considers
such harbors extremely useful as equipment and supply bases
for Atlantic U-boats to call at temporarily.”)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>e</span>) What decisive advantages would exist for the conduct of
the war at sea in gaining bases in North Denmark, e.g. Skagen?”
(<span class='it'>C-122</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A memorandum written by Doenitz on Norwegian bases presumably
relates to the questionnaire of Raeder, which was in circulation
about that time. Doenitz’s document is headed, “Flag
Officer Submarines, Operations Division,” and is marked “Most
Secret.” The subject is “Base in Norway.” Then there are set
out “suppositions”, “advantages and disadvantages”, and then
“conclusions”. The last paragraph (III) reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The following is therefore proposed:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(1) Establishment of a base in Trondheim, including:
<span class='pageno' title='738' id='Page_738'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> Possibility of supplying fuel, compressed air, oxygen,
provisions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> Repair opportunities for overhaul work after an encounter.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> Good opportunities for accommodating U-boat crews.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>d.</span> Flak protection, L.A. armament, petrol and M/S units.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Secondly, establishment of the possibility of supplying fuel
in Narvik as an alternative.” (<span class='it'>C-5</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In October 1939 Hitler was merely considering the Norwegian
aggression and had not yet committed himself to it. Raeder persevered
in pressing his point of view with regard to Norway, and
at this stage he found a powerful ally in Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Use of the Fifth Column: Quisling.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi employment of traitors and the stimulation of treachery
as a political weapon are now proven historical facts. Should
further proof be required, it is found in a “Brief Report on Activities
of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Party (<span class='it'>Aussenpolitisches
Amt der NSDAP</span>) from 1933 to 1943” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>). This was
Rosenberg’s Bureau. The report reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When the Foreign Affairs Bureau (<span class='it'>Aussenpolitische Amt</span>)
was established on the 1st of April 1933, the Fuehrer directed
that it should not be expanded to a large bureaucratic agency,
but should rather develop its effectiveness through initiative
and suggestions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Corresponding to the extraordinarily hostile attitude
adopted by the Soviet Government in Moscow from the beginning,
the newly-established Bureau devoted particular attention
to internal conditions in the Soviet Union, as well as
to the effects of World Bolshevism primarily in other European
countries. It entered into contact with the most variegated
groups inclining towards National Socialism in combatting
Bolshevism, focussing its main attention on Nations
and States bordering on the Soviet Union. On the one hand,
those Nations and states constituted an <span class='it'>Insulating Ring</span> encircling
the Bolshevist neighbor; on the other hand they
were the laterals of German living space and took up a flanking
position towards the Western Powers, especially Great
Britain. In order to wield the desired influence by one means
or another, the Bureau was compelled to use the most varying
methods, taking into consideration the completely different
living conditions, the ties of blood, intellect and history
of the movements observed by the Bureau in those countries.
<span class='pageno' title='739' id='Page_739'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“In Scandinavia an outspokenly pro-Anglo-Saxon attitude,
based on economic consideration, had become progressively
more dominant after the World War of 1914-18. There the
Bureau put the entire emphasis on influencing general cultural
relations with the Nordic peoples. For this purpose it
took the Nordic Society in Luebeck under its protection. The
Reich conventions of this society were attended by many outstanding
personalities, especially from Finland. While there
were no openings for purely political cooperation in Sweden
and Denmark, an association based on Greater Germanic
ideology was found in Norway. Very close relations were
established with its founder, which led to further consequences.”
(<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>There follows an account of the activity of Rosenberg’s Bureau
in various parts of the world. The last paragraph of the main
body of the report reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“With the outbreak of war, the Bureau was entitled to consider
its task as terminated. The exploitation of the many
personal connections in many lands can be resumed under a
different guise.” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Annex to the report shows what the “exploitation of personal
connections” involved. Annex One to the document is
headed, “To Brief Report on Activities of the Foreign Affairs
Bureau of the Nazi Party from 1933 to 1943.” The subheading
is “The Political Preparation of the Military Occupation of Norway
During the War Years 1939-1940”. The annex reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As previously mentioned, of all political groupings in Scandinavia,
only ‘<span class='it'>Nasjonal Samling</span>’ led in Norway by the former
Minister of War and Major of the Reserve, Vidkun
Quisling, deserved serious political attention. This was a
fighting political group, possessed by the idea of a Greater
Germanic Community. Naturally, all ruling powers were
hostile and attempted to prevent, by any means, its success
among the population. The Bureau maintained constant
liaison with Quisling and attentively observed the attacks he
conducted with tenacious energy on the middle class, which
had been taken in tow by the English.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“From the beginning, it appeared probable that without revolutionary
events, which would stir the population from their
former attitude, no successful progress of <span class='it'>Nasjonal Samling</span>
was to be expected. During the winter 1938-1939, Quisling
was privately visited by a member of the Bureau.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“When the political situation in Europe came to a head in
<span class='pageno' title='740' id='Page_740'></span>
1939, Quisling made an appearance at the convention of the
Nordic Society in Luebeck in June. He expounded his conception
of the situation, and his apprehensions concerning
Norway. He emphatically drew attention to the geopolitically
decisive importance of Norway in the Scandinavian
area, and to the advantages that would accrue to the power
dominating the Norwegian coast in case of a conflict between
the Greater German Reich and Great Britain.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Assuming that his statement would be of special interest to
the Marshal of the Reich Goering for aero-strategical reasons,
Quisling was referred to State Secretary Koerner by
the Bureau. The Staff Director of the Bureau handed the
Chief of the Reich Chancellery a memorandum for transmission
to the Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This document is another illustration of the close interweaving
between the political and military leadership of the Nazi State.
Raeder, in his report to Admiral Assmann, admitted his collaboration
with Rosenberg (<span class='it'>C-66</span>). The second paragraph of the
Raeder report, headed “<span class='it'>Weseruebung</span>,” reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the further developments, I was supported by Commander
Schreiber, Naval Attache in Oslo and the M-Chief
personally—in conjunction with the Rosenberg Organization.
Thus, we got in touch with Quisling and Hagelin, who
came to Berlin at the beginning of December and were taken
to the Fuehrer by me—with the approval of Reichsleiter
Rosenberg.” (<span class='it'>C-66</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The details of the manner in which Raeder made contact personally
with Quisling are not clear. In a report from Rosenberg
to Raeder, however, the full extent of Quisling’s preparedness for
treachery and his potential usefulness to the Nazi aggressors was
reported and disclosed to Raeder. The second paragraph of this
report reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The reasons for a coup, on which Quisling made a report,
would be provided by the fact that the Storthing (the Norwegian
Parliament) had, in defense of the constitution,
passed a resolution prolonging its own life which is to become
operative on January 12th. Quisling still retains in his
capacity as a long-standing officer and a former Minister of
War, the closest relations with the Norwegian Army. He
showed me the original of a letter which he had received only
a short time previously from the Commanding Officer in Narvik,
Colonel Sunlo. In this letter, Colonel Sunlo frankly lays
emphasis on the fact that, if things went on as they were going
at present, Norway was finished.” (<span class='it'>C-65</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='741' id='Page_741'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Then came the details of a plot to overthrow the government of
Norway by the traitor Quisling, in collaboration with Rosenberg:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“A plan has been put forward which deals with the possibility
of a coup, and which provides for a number of selected
Norwegians to be trained in Germany with all possible speed
for such a purpose, being allotted their exact tasks, and provided
with experienced and die-hard National Socialists, who
are practiced in such operations. These trained men should
then proceed with all speed to Norway, where details would
then require to be further discussed. Some important centers
in Oslo would have to be taken over immediately, and at
the same time the German Fleet, together with suitable contingents
of the German Army, would go into operation when
summoned specially by the new Norwegian Government in a
specified bay at the approaches to Oslo. Quisling has no
doubts that such a coup, having been carried out with instantaneous
success—would immediately bring him the approval
of those sections of the Army with which he at present has
connections, and thus it goes without saying that he has
never discussed a political fight with them. As far as the
King is concerned, he believes that he would respect it as an
accomplished fact. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Quisling gives figures of the number of German troops required
which accord with German calculations.” (<span class='it'>C-65</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Subsequent developments are indicated in a report by Raeder
of his meeting with Hitler on 12 December 1939 at 1200 hours, in
the presence of Keitel, Jodl and Puttkammer, who at this time
was adjutant to Hitler. The report is headed “Norwegian Question”,
and the first sentence reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“C-in-C Navy” (Raeder) “has received Quisling and Hagelin.
Quisling creates the impression of being reliable.” (<span class='it'>C-64</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>There then follows, in the next, two paragraphs, a statement of
Quisling’s views. The fourth paragraph reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer thought of speaking to Quisling personally so
that he might form an impression of him. He wanted to see
Rosenberg once more beforehand, as the latter has known
Quisling for a long while. C-in-C Navy” [Raeder] “suggests
that if the Fuehrer forms a favorable impression, the OKW
should obtain permission to make plans with Quisling for the
preparation and carrying out of the occupation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>a</span>) By peaceful means; that is to say, German forces summoned
by Norway, or</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>b</span>) To agree to do so by force.” (<span class='it'>C-64</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='742' id='Page_742'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>It was at a meeting on 12 December that Raeder made the above
report to Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raeder’s record of these transactions reports the next event:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Thus, we got in touch with Quisling and Hagelin, who came
to Berlin at the beginning of December and were taken to
the Fuehrer by me, with the approval of Reichsleiter Rosenberg.”
(<span class='it'>C-66</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>A note at the bottom of the page states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“At the crucial moment, R” (presumably Rosenberg) “hurt
his foot, so that I visited him in his house on the morning of
the 14th of December.” (<span class='it'>C-66</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That is Raeder’s note, and it indicates the extent of his contact
in this conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the grounds of the Fuehrer’s discussion with Quisling
and Hagelin on the afternoon of the 14th of December, the
Fuehrer gave the order that the preparations for the Norwegian
operation were to be made by the Supreme Command
of the Armed Forces.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Until that moment, the Naval War Staff had taken no part
in the development of the Norwegian question, and continued
to be somewhat skeptical about it. The preparations, which
were undertaken by Captain Kranke in the Supreme Command
of the Armed Forces, were founded, however, on a
memorandum of the Naval War Staff.” (<span class='it'>C-66</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Raeder’s note referring to the “crucial” moment was an appropriate
one, for on the same day that it was written, 14 December,
Hitler gave the order that preparations for the Norwegian
operation were to be begun by the Supreme Command of the
Armed Forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg’s report on the activities of his organization deals
with further meetings between Quisling and the Nazi chiefs in
December. The extract reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Quisling was granted a personal audience with the Fuehrer
on 16 December, and once more on 18 December. In the
course of this audience the Fuehrer emphasized repeatedly
that he personally would prefer a completely neutral attitude
of Norway, as well as of the whole of Scandinavia. He did
not intend to enlarge the theatre of war and to draw still
other nations into the conflict. * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Should the enemy attempt to extend the war however, with
the aim of achieving further throttling and intimidation of
<span class='pageno' title='743' id='Page_743'></span>
the Greater German Reich, he would be compelled to gird
himself against such an undertaking. In order to counterbalance
increasing enemy propaganda activity, he promised
Quisling financial support of his movement, which is based
on Greater German ideology. Military exploitation of the
question now raised was assigned to the special military staff,
which transmitted special missions to Quisling. Reichsleiter
Rosenberg was to take over political exploitation. Financial
expenses were to be defrayed by the Ministry for Foreign
Affairs [Ribbentrop’s organization], the Minister for Foreign
Affairs [Ribbentrop] being kept continuously informed
by the Foreign Affairs Bureau [Rosenberg’s organization].</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Chief of Section Scheidt was charged with maintaining liaison
with Quisling. In the course of further developments
he was assigned to the Naval Attache in Oslo. Orders were
given that the whole matter be handled with strictest secrecy.”
(<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Here again is a further indication of the close link between the
Nazi politicians and the Nazi service chiefs.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>Operational Planning</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The information available on the events of January 1940 is not
full, but it is clear that the agitation of Raeder and Rosenberg
bore fruit. An order signed by Keitel, dated 27 January 1940,
marked “Most Secret, five copies; reference, Study ‘N’ ”, (an
earlier code name for the <span class='it'>Weseruebung</span> preparations) and classified
“Access only through an officer,” stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“C-in-C of the Navy [Raeder] has a report on this * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces
wishes that Study ‘N’ should be further worked on under my
direct and personal guidance, and in the closest conjunction
with the general war policy. For these reasons the Fuehrer
has commissioned me to take over the direction of further
preparations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A working staff has been formed at the Supreme Command
of the Armed Forces Headquarters for this purpose, and this
represents at the same time the nucleus of a future operational
staff.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

(<span class='it'>C-63</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of that document, to the signature of Keitel
upon it, and to the date of this important decision, is this: Prior
<span class='pageno' title='744' id='Page_744'></span>
to this date, 27 January 1940, the planning of the various aspects
of the invasion of Norway and Denmark had been confined to a
relatively small group, whose aim had been to persuade Hitler of
the desirability of undertaking the operation. The issuance of
this directive of Keitel’s on 27 January 1940, was the signal that
the Supreme Command of the German Armed Forces, the OKW,
had accepted the proposition of the group that was pressing for
the Norwegian adventure, and had turned the combined resources
of the German military machine to the task of producing practical
and coordinated plans for the Norwegian operation. From
January onward the operational planning for the invasion of
Norway and Denmark was started through the normal channels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certain entries in the diary of Jodl reveal how the preparations
progressed (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>). The entry for 6 February commences:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“New idea: Carry out ‘H’ [<span class='it'>Hartmundt</span>, another code word

only and guarantee Belgium’s neutrality for the duration of
the war.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The entry for 21 February reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Fuehrer has talked with General von Falkenhorst, and
charges him with preparation of ‘Weser Exercise.’ Falkenhorst
accepts gladly. Instructions issued to the three branches
of the armed forces.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The entry for 28 February reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I propose, first to the Chief of OKW and then to the Fuehrer,
that Case Yellow [the code name for the invasion of the
Netherlands] and Weser Exercise [the invasion of Norway

be independent of one another as regards both time and
forces employed. The Fuehrer completely agrees, if this is
in any way possible.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came Hitler’s order to complete the preparations for the
invasion of Norway and Denmark (<span class='it'>C-174</span>). It bears the date of
1 March 1940, and reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The development of the situation in Scandinavia requires
the making of all preparations for the occupation of Denmark
and Norway by a part of the German Armed Forces—<span class='it'>Fall

encroachment on Scandinavia and the Baltic; further, it
should guarantee our ore base in Sweden and give our Navy
and Air Force a wider start line against Britain.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of our military and political power in comparison
with that of the Scandinavian States, the force to be employed
in the <span class='it'>Fall Weseruebung</span> will be kept as small as possible.
The numerical weakness will be balanced by daring
actions and surprise execution. On principle we will do our
utmost to make the operation appear as a peaceful occupation,
the object of which is the military protection of the
neutrality of the Scandinavian States. Corresponding demands
will be transmitted to the Governments at the beginning
of the occupation. If necessary, demonstrations by the
Navy and the Air Force will provide the necessary emphasis.
If, in spite of this, resistance should be met with, all military
means will be used to crush it.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I put in charge of the preparations and the conduct of the
operation against Denmark and Norway the Commanding
General of the 21st Army Corps, General von Falkenhorst.

<p class='noindent'>“The crossing of the Danish border and the landings in Norway
must take place simultaneously. I emphasize that the
operations must be prepared as quickly as possible. In case
the enemy seizes the initiative against Norway, we must be
able to apply immediately our own counter-measures.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is most important that the Scandinavian States as well
as the Western opponents should be taken by surprise by our
measures. All preparations, particularly those of transport
and of readiness, drafting and embarkation of the troops,
must be made with this factor in mind.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In case the preparations for embarkation can no longer be
<span class='pageno' title='746' id='Page_746'></span>
kept secret, the leaders and the troops will be deceived with
fictitious objectives.” (<span class='it'>C-174</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The section on “The Occupation of Denmark” which is given
the code name of “<span class='it'>Weseruebung Sued</span>”, provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The task of Group XXI: Occupation by surprise of Jutland
and of Fuenen immediately after occupation of Seeland.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Added to this, having secured the most important places,
the Group will break through as quickly as possible from
Fuenen to Skagen and to the east coast.” (<span class='it'>C-174</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>There then follow other instructions with regard to the operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The section on “The Occupation of Norway”, given the code
name of “<span class='it'>Weseruebung Nord</span>”, provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The task of the Group XXI: Capture by surprise of the
most important places on the coast by sea and airborne operations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Navy will take over the preparation and carrying out
of the transport by sea of the landing troops. * * * The
Air Force, after the occupation has been completed, will ensure
air defense and will make use of Norwegian bases for
air warfare against Britain.” (<span class='it'>C-174</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst these preparations were being made, and just prior to
the final decision of Hitler, reports were coming in through Rosenberg’s
organization from Quisling. The third paragraph in Annex
I, the section dealing with Norway, has this information:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Quisling’s reports, transmitted to his representative in Germany,
Hagelin, and dealing with the possibility of intervention
by the Western Powers in Norway with tacit consent of
the Norwegian Government, became more urgent by January.
These increasingly better substantiated communications were
in sharpest contrast to the views of the German Legation in
Oslo, which relied on the desire for neutrality of the then
Norwegian Nygardszvold Cabinet, and was convinced of that
government’s intention and readiness to defend Norway’s
neutrality. No one in Norway knew that Quisling’s representative
for Germany maintained closest relations to him;
he therefore succeeded in gaining a foothold within governmental
circles of the Nygardszvold cabinet and in listening to
the cabinet members’ views. Hagelin transmitted what he
had heard to the Bureau [Rosenberg’s bureau], which conveyed
the news to the Fuehrer through Reichsleiter Rosenberg.
During the night of the 16th to 17th of February,
English destroyers attacked the German steamer ‘Altmark’
in Jessingjord.* * *” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='747' id='Page_747'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(That is a reference to the action by the British destroyer
<span class='it'>Cossack</span> against the German naval auxiliary vessel <span class='it'>Altmark</span>,
which was carrying three hundred British prisoners, captured on
the high seas, to Germany through Norwegian territorial waters.
The position of the British delegation with regard to that episode
is that the use that was being made by the <span class='it'>Altmark</span> of Norwegian
territorial waters was in fact a flagrant abuse in itself of Norwegian
neutrality, and that the action taken by H.M.S. <span class='it'>Cossack</span>,
which was restricted to rescuing the three hundred British prisoners
on board, no attempt being made to destroy the <span class='it'>Altmark</span>
or to capture the armed guards on board her, was fully justified
under international law.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rosenberg report continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Norwegian Government’s reaction to this question permitted
the conclusion that certain agreements had been covertly
arrived at between the Norwegian Government and the
Allies. Such assumption was confirmed by reports of Section
Scheidt, who in turn derived his information from
Hagelin and Quisling. But even after this incident the German
Legation in Oslo championed the opposite view, and
went on record as believing in the good intentions of the
Norwegians.” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And so the Nazi Government preferred the reports of the
traitor Quisling to the considered judgment of German diplomatic
representatives in Norway. The result of the receipt of reports
of that kind was the Hitler decision to invade Norway and Denmark.
The culminating details in the preparations for the invasion
are again found in Jodl’s diary. The entry for 3 March relates:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer expressed himself very sharply on the necessity
of a swift entry into N [Norway] with strong forces.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“No delay by any branch of the armed forces. Very rapid
acceleration of the attack necessary.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The last entry for 3 March reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Fuehrer decides to carry out ‘Weser Exercise’ before case
‘Yellow’ with a few days interval.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the important issue of strategy which had been concerning
the German High Command for some time had been decided
by this date, and the fate of Scandinavia was to be sealed before
the fate of the Low Country. It will be observed from those entries
of 3 March that by that date Hitler had become an enthusiastic
convert to the idea of aggression against Norway.
<span class='pageno' title='748' id='Page_748'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The entry in Jodl’s diary for 5 March reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Big conference with the three commanders-in-chief about
‘Weser Exercise.’ Field Marshal in a rage because not consulted

(<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The entry for 13 March is one of the most remarkable in the
documentation of this case.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Fuehrer does not give order yet for ‘W’ [Weser Exercise].
He is still looking for an excuse.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The entry of the next day, 14 March, shows a similar preoccupation
on the part of Hitler with the search for an excuse for this
aggression. It reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“English keep vigil in the North Sea with fifteen to sixteen
submarines; doubtful whether reason to safeguard own operations
or prevent operations by Germans. Fuehrer has not
yet decided what reason to give for ‘Weser Exercise.’ ”
(<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The entry for 21 March reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Misgivings of Task Force 21 [Falkenhorst’s Force, detailed
to conduct the invasion] about the long interval between
taking up readiness positions at 05.30 hours and close of
diplomatic negotiations. Fuehrer rejects any earlier negotiations,
as otherwise calls for help go out to England and
America. If resistance is put up it must be ruthlessly broken.
The political plenipotentiaries must emphasize the military
measures taken, and even exaggerate them.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The entry of 28 March reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Individual naval officers seem to be lukewarm concerning
the Weser Exercise and need a stimulus. Also Falkenhorst
and the other two commanders are worrying about matters
which are none of their business. Franke sees more disadvantages
than advantages.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the evening the Fuehrer visits the map room and roundly
declares that he won’t stand for the Navy clearing out of the
<span class='pageno' title='749' id='Page_749'></span>
Norwegian ports right away. Narvik, Trondheim and Oslo
will have to remain occupied by naval forces.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The entry for 2 April reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy, and General von Falkenhorst with the Fuehrer.
All confirm preparations completed. Fuehrer orders carrying
out of the Weser Exercise for April 9th.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

Military Intelligence 1, returns with good results from the
talks with Quisling in Copenhagen.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From the large number of operation orders that were issued in
connection with the aggression against Norway and Denmark,
two may be cited to illustrate the extent of the secrecy and deception
that was used by the conspirators in the course of that
aggression. The first dated 4 April 1940, reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The barrage-breaking vessels (<span class='it'>Sperrbrechers</span>) will
penetrate inconspicuously, and with lights on, into Oslo
Fjord, disguised as merchant steamers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Challenge from coastal signal stations and lookouts are to
be answered by the deceptive use of the names of English
steamers. I lay particular stress on the importance of not
giving away the operation before zero hour.” (<span class='it'>C-115</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>E. <span class='it'>Nazi Justification of Invasion.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>On 9 April 1940 the Nazi onslaught on the unsuspecting and
almost unarmed people of Norway and Denmark was launched.
When the invasions had already begun, a German memorandum
was handed to the governments of Norway and Denmark attempting
to justify the German action (<span class='it'>TC-55</span>). That memorandum
alleges that England and France were guilty in their maritime
warfare of breaches of international law; that Britain and France
are making plans themselves to invade and occupy Norway; and
that the government of Norway was prepared to acquiesce in such
a situation. The memorandum further states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German troops therefore do not set foot on Norwegian
soil as enemies. The German High Command does not intend
to make use of the points occupied by German troops as bases
for operations against England, so long as it is not forced to
do so by measures taken by England and France. German
military operations aim much more exclusively at protecting
<span class='pageno' title='751' id='Page_751'></span>
the north against proposed occupation of Norwegian strong
points by English-French forces.” (<span class='it'>TC-55</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with that statement it may be recalled that in his
operation order on 1 March Hitler had given orders to the Air
Force to make use of Norwegian bases for air warfare against
Britain. That was on 1 March. And this is the memorandum
which was produced as an excuse on 9 April. The last two paragraphs
of the German memorandum to Norway and Denmark
are a classic Nazi combination of diplomatic hypocrisy and military
threat:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Government thus expects that the Royal Norwegian
Government and the Norwegian people will respond
with understanding to the German measures and offer no resistance
to it. Any resistance would have to be and would be
broken by all possible means by the German forces employed,
and would therefore lead only to absolutely useless bloodshed.
The Royal Norwegian Government is therefore requested to
take all measures with the greatest speed to ensure that the
advance of the German troops can take place without friction
and difficulty. In the spirit of the good German-Norwegian
relations that have always existed, the Reich Government declares
to the Royal Norwegian Government that Germany
has no intention of infringing by her measures the territorial
integrity and political independence of the Kingdom of Norway
now or in the future.” (<span class='it'>TC-55</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What the Nazis meant by “protection of the kingdom of Norway”
was shown by their conduct on 9 April.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A report by the Commander in Chief of the Royal Norwegian
Forces states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The Germans, considering the long lines of communications
and the threat of the British Navy, clearly understood
the necessity of complete surprise and speed in the
attack. In order to paralyze the will of the Norwegian people
to defend their country and at the same time to prevent allied
intervention it was planned to capture all the more important
towns along the coast simultaneously. Members of the Government
and Parliament and other military and civilian people
occupying important positions were to be arrested before
organized resistance could be put into effect and the King
was to be forced to form a new government with Quisling
as the head.”
<span class='pageno' title='752' id='Page_752'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The German attack came as a surprise and all the invaded
towns along the coast were captured according to plan with
only slight losses. In the Oslofjord, however, the cruiser
‘Blucher’, carrying General Engelbrecht and parts of his division,
technical staffs and specialists who were to take over
the control of Oslo, was sunk. The plan to capture the King
and members of the Government and Parliament failed in
spite of the surprise of the attack; resistance was organized
throughout the country.” (<span class='it'>TC-56</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What happened in Denmark is described in a memorandum
prepared by the Royal Danish Government (<span class='it'>D-628</span>). An extract
from it reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Extracts from the Memorandum concerning Germany’s attitude
towards Denmark before and during the occupation,
prepared by the Royal Danish Government.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On the 9th of April, 1940 at 4.20 hours the German Minister
appeared at the private residence of the Danish Minister
for Foreign Affairs accompanied by the Air Attache of the
Legation. The appointment had been made by a telephone
call from the German Legation to the Secretary-General of
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at 4.00 o’clock the same
morning. The Minister said at once that Germany had positive
proof that Great Britain intended to occupy bases in
Denmark and Norway. Germany had to safeguard Denmark
against this. For this reason German soldiers were now
crossing the frontier and landing at various points in Zealand
including the port of Copenhagen; in a short time German
bombers would be over Copenhagen; their orders were
not to bomb until further notice. It was now up to the Danes
to prevent resistance as any resistance would have the most
terrible consequences. Germany would guarantee Denmark’s
territorial integrity and political independence. Germany
would not interfere with the internal government of Denmark,
but wanted only to make sure of the neutrality of the
country. For this purpose the presence of the German Wehrmacht
in Denmark was required during the war.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Minister for Foreign Affairs declared in reply that the
allegation concerning British plans to occupy Denmark was
completely without foundation; there was no possibility of
<span class='pageno' title='753' id='Page_753'></span>
anything like that. The Minister for Foreign Affairs protested
against the violation of Denmark’s neutrality which
according to the German Minister’s statement was in progress.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs declared further that
he could not give a reply to the demands, which had to be
submitted to the King and the Prime Minister, and further
observed that the German Minister knew, as everybody else,
that the Danish armed forces had orders to oppose violations
of Denmark’s neutrality so that fighting presumably already
took place. In reply the German Minister expressed that the
matter was very urgent, not least to avoid air bombardment.”
(<span class='it'>D-628</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What happened thereafter is described in a dispatch from the
British Minister in Copenhagen to the British Foreign Secretary
(<span class='it'>D-627</span>). That dispatch reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The actual events of the 9th April have been pieced together
by members of my staff from actual eye-witnesses or from
reliable information subsequently received and are given below.
Early in the morning towards 5 o’clock three small German
transports steamed into the approach to Copenhagen
harbor, whilst a number of airplanes circled overhead. The
northern battery, guarding the harbor approach, fired a warning
shot at these planes when it was seen that they carried
German markings. Apart from this, the Danes offered no
further resistance, and the German vessels fastened alongside
the quays in the Free Harbor. Some of these airplanes
proceeded to drop leaflets over the town urging the population
to keep calm and cooperate with the Germans. I enclose
a specimen of this leaflet, which is written in a bastard Norwegian-Danish,
a curiously un-German disregard of detail,
together with a translation. Approximately 800 soldiers
landed with full equipment, and marched to Kastellet, the old
fortress of Copenhagen and now a barracks. The door was
locked, so the Germans promptly burst it open with explosives
and rounded up all the Danish soldiers within, together with
the womenfolk employed in the mess. The garrison offered
no resistance, and it appears that they were taken completely
by surprise. One officer tried to escape in a motor car, but
his chauffeur was shot before they could get away. He died
in hospital two days later. After seizing the barracks, a detachment
was sent to Amalienborg, the King’s palace, where
<span class='pageno' title='754' id='Page_754'></span>
they engaged the Danish sentries on guard, wounding three,
one of them fatally. Meanwhile, a large fleet of bombers flew
over the city at low altitudes.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It has been difficult to ascertain exactly what occurred in
Jutland. It is clear, however, that the enemy invaded Jutland
from the south at dawn on the 9th April and were at
first resisted by the Danish forces, who suffered casualties.
The chances of resistance were weakened by the extent to
which the forces appear to have been taken by surprise. The
chief permanent official of the Ministry of War, for instance,
motored into Copenhagen on the morning of the 9th April
and drove blithely past a sentry who challenged him, in blissful
ignorance that this was not one of his own men. It took
a bullet, which passed through the lapels of his coat, to disillusion
him.” (<span class='it'>D-627</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The German memorandum to the Norwegian and Danish governments
spoke of the German desire to maintain the territorial
integrity and political independence of those two small countries.
Two documents indicate the kind of territorial integrity and political
independence the Nazi conspirators contemplated for the
victims of their aggression. An entry in Jodl’s diary for 19 April
reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Renewed crisis. Envoy Braver is recalled: since Norway is
at war with us, the task of the Foreign Office is finished. In
the Fuehrer’s opinion, force has to be used. It is said that
Gauleiter Terboven will be given a post. Field Marshal [presumably
a reference to Goering] is moving in the same direction.
He criticizes as defects that we didn’t take sufficiently
energetic measures against the civilian population, that we
could have seized electrical plant, that the Navy didn’t supply
enough troops. The Air Force can’t do everything.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It will be seen from that entry and the reference to Gauleiter
Terboven that already by 19 April, rule by Gauleiters had replaced
rule by Norwegians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A memorandum dated 3 June 1940, signed by Fricke, at that
date the head of the Operations Division of the German Naval
War Staff, which was a key appointment in the very nerve center
of German naval operations, relates to questions of territorial expansion
and bases (<span class='it'>C-41</span>). It reads:
<span class='pageno' title='755' id='Page_755'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“These problems are preeminently of a political character
and comprise an abundance of questions of a political type,
which it is not the Navy’s province to answer, but they also
materially affect the strategic possibilities open—according
to the way in which this question is answered—for the subsequent
use and operation of the Navy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is too well known to need further mention that Germany’s
present position in the narrows of the Heligoland Bight and
in the Baltic—bordered as it is by a whole series of States
and under their influence—is an impossible one for the future
of Greater Germany. If, over and above this, one extends
these strategic possibilities to the point that Germany
shall not continue to be cut off for all time from overseas by
natural geographical facts, the demand is raised that somehow
or other an end shall be put to this state of affairs at the
end of the war.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The solution could perhaps be found among the following
possibilities.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The territories of Denmark, Norway and Northern
France acquired during the course of the war continue to be
so occupied and organized that they can in future be considered
as German possessions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This solution will recommend itself for areas where the severity
of the decision tells, and should tell, on the enemy and
where a gradual ‘Germanizing’ of the territory appears practicable.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The taking over and holding of areas which have no direct
connection with Germany’s main body, and which, like
the Russian solution in Hango, remain permanently as an enclave
in the hostile State. Such areas might be considered
possibly around Brest and Trondjem.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The power of Greater Germany in the strategic areas acquired
in this war should result in the existing population of
these areas feeling themselves politically, economically and
militarily to be completely dependent on Germany. If the
following results are achieved—that expansion is undertaken
(on a scale I shall describe later) by means of the military
measures for occupation taken during the war, that French
powers of resistance (popular unity, mineral resources, industry,
Armed Forces) are so broken that a revival must be
considered out of the question, that the smaller States such
as the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway are forced into a
<span class='pageno' title='756' id='Page_756'></span>
dependence on us which will enable us in any circumstances
and at any time easily to occupy these countries again, then
in practice the same, but psychologically much more, will be
achieved.” (<span class='it'>C-41</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then Fricke recommends:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The solution given in 3, therefore, appears to be the proper
one, that is, to crush France, to occupy Belgium, part of
North and East France, to allow the Netherlands, Denmark
and Norway to exist on the basis indicated above.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Time will show how far the outcome of the war with England
will make an extension of these demands possible.”
(<span class='it'>C-41</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The submission of the prosecution is that that and other documents
which have been submitted tear apart the veil of Nazi pretense.
These documents reveal the menace behind the good-will
of Goering; they expose as fraudulent the diplomacy of Ribbentrop;
they show the reality behind the ostensible political ideology
of tradesmen in treason like Rosenberg; and finally and above
all, they render sordid the professional status of Keitel and of
Raeder.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg760a'>10. AGGRESSION AGAINST BELGIUM, THE NETHERLANDS,<br/> AND LUXEMBOURG</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The independence of Belgium, which for so many centuries was
the cockpit of Europe, was guaranteed by the great European
powers in 1839. That guarantee was observed for 75 years, until
it was broken by the Germans in 1914, who brought all the horrors
of war, and the even greater horrors of German occupation,
to Belgium. History was to repeat itself in a still more catastrophic
fashion some 25 years after, in 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the applicable treaties are the Hague Convention of
1907 (<span class='it'>TC-3</span>; <span class='it'>TC-4</span>), the Locarno Arbitration and Conciliation
Convention of 1925, in which Belgium’s independence and neutrality
were guaranteed by Germany; the Kellogg-Briand Pact of
1928, by which all the Powers renounced recourse to war; and the
Hague Convention of Arbitration and Conciliation May 1926 between
Germany and the Netherlands (<span class='it'>TC-16</span>). Article I of the
latter treaty provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The contracting parties” (the Netherlands and the German
Reich) “undertake to submit all disputes of any nature whatever
which may arise between them which it has not been
possible to settle by diplomacy, and which have not been referred
to the Permanent Court of International Justice, to be
dealt with by arbitration or conciliation as provided.”
(<span class='it'>TC-16</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Subsequent clauses deal with the machinery of conciliation.
The last article, Article 21, provides that the Convention shall be
valid for ten years, and then shall remain in force for successive
periods of five years until denounced by either party. And this
treaty never was denounced by Germany at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last of the applicable treaties, all of which belong to the
days of the Weimar Republic, is the Treaty of Arbitration and
Conciliation between Germany and Luxembourg, executed at Geneva
in 1929 (<span class='it'>TC-20</span>). The first few words of Article 1 are familiar:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The contracting parties undertake to settle by peaceful
means all disputes of any nature whatever which may arise
between them and which it may not be possible to settle by</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then follow clauses dealing with the machinery for peaceful
settlement of disputes, which are in the common form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those were the treaty obligations between Germany and Belgium
at the time when the Nazi Party came into power in 1933.
Hitler adopted and ratified the obligations of Germany under the
<span class='pageno' title='761' id='Page_761'></span>
Weimar Republic with regard to the treaties which had been entered
into. Nothing more occurred to alter the position of Belgium
until March 1936. Germany reoccupied the Rhineland and
announced the resumption of conscription. And Hitler, on 7 March
1936 purported in a speech to repudiate the obligations of the
German Government under the Locarno Pact, the reason being
given as the execution of the Franco-Soviet Pact of 1935. There
was no legal foundation for this claim that Germany was entitled
to renounce obligations under the Locarno Pact. But Belgium
was left in the air, in the sense that it had itself entered
into various obligations under the Locarno Pact in return for the
liabilities which other nations acknowledged, and now one of
those liabilities, namely, the liability of Germany to observe the
Pact, had been renounced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so on 30 January 1937, perhaps because Hitler realized
the position of Belgium and of the Netherlands, Hitler gave
solemn assurance—he used the word “solemn”—which amounted
to a full guarantee (<span class='it'>TC-33</span>). In April 1937, France and England
released Belgium from her obligations under the Locarno Pact.
Belgium gave guarantees of strict independence and neutrality,
and France and England gave guarantees of assistance should
Belgium be attacked. It was because of those facts that Germany,
on 13 October 1937, gave a clear and unconditional guarantee to
Belgium:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have the honor on behalf of the German Government to
make the following communication to Your Excellency: The
German Government has taken cognizance with particular
interest of the public declaration in which the Belgium Government
defines the international position of Belgium. For
its part, it has repeatedly given expressions, especially
through the declaration of the Chancellor of the German
Reich in his speech of January 30th, 1937, to its own point
of view. The German Government has also taken cognizance
of the declaration made by the British and French Governments
on the 24th of April 1937 * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Since the conclusion of a treaty to replace the Treaty of
Locarno may still take some time, and being desirous of
strengthening the peaceful aspirations of the two countries,
the German Government regards it as appropriate to define
now its own attitude towards Belgium. To this end, it makes
the following declaration: First, the German Government
has taken note of the views which the Belgian Government
has thought fit to express. That is to say, (<span class='it'>a</span>) of the policy
of independence which it intends to exercise in full sovereignty;
<span class='pageno' title='762' id='Page_762'></span>
(<span class='it'>b</span>) of its determination to defend the frontiers of
Belgium with all its forces against any aggression or invasion
and to prevent Belgian territory from being used for
purposes of aggression against another state as a passage or
as a base of operation by land, by sea, or in the air, and to
organize the defense of Belgium in an efficient manner to this
purpose. Two: The German Government considers that the
inviolability and integrity of Belgium are common interests
of the Western Powers. It confirms its determination that
in no circumstances will it impair this inviolability and integrity
and that it will at all times respect Belgian territory
except, of course, in the event of Belgium’s taking part in a
military action directed against Germany in an armed conflict
in which Germany is involved. The German Government,
like the British and French Governments, is prepared to assist
Belgium should she be subjected to an attack or to invasion.
* * *” (<span class='it'>TC-34</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The following reply was made:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Belgian Government has taken note with great satisfaction
of the declaration communicated to it this day by the
German Government. It thanks the German Government
warmly for this communication.” (<span class='it'>TC-34</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, in October 1937, Germany gave a solemn guarantee to
this small nation of its peaceful aspiration towards her, and its
assertion that the integrity of the Belgian frontier was a common
interest between her and Belgium and the other Western
Powers. Yet eighteen months afterwards Germany had violated
that assurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That this declaration of October 1937 meant very little to the
leaders and to the high command of Germany can be seen from a
document which came into existence on 24 August 1938, at the
time when the Czechoslovakia drama was unfolding, and when it
was uncertain whether there would be war with the Western
Powers. This Top Secret document is addressed to the General
Staff of the 5th Section of the German Air Force, and deals with
the subject, “Extended Case Green—Appreciation of the Situation
with Special Consideration of the Enemy.” Apparently some
staff officer had been asked to prepare this appreciation. The last
paragraph (No. H) reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Requests to Armed Forces Supreme Command, Army and
Navy. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Belgium and the Netherlands would, in German hands, represent
an extraordinary advantage in the prosecution of the
air war against Great Britain as well as against France.
<span class='pageno' title='763' id='Page_763'></span>
Therefore it is held to be essential to obtain the opinion of
the Army as to the conditions under which an occupation of
this area could be carried out and how long it would take, and
in this case it would be necessary to reassess the commitment
against Great Britain.” (<span class='it'>375-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was apparently assumed by the staff officer who prepared
this document, and assumed quite rightly, that the leaders of the
German nation and the High Command would not pay the smallest
attention to the fact that Germany had given her word not to
invade Holland or Belgium. It was recommended as a militarily
advantageous thing to do, with the knowledge that, if the commanders
and the Fuehrer agreed with that view, treaties would
be completely ignored. Such was the honor of the German Government
and of its leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In March of 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia had been
peacefully annexed, and the time had come for further guarantees.
Assurances which were accordingly given to Belgium and the
Netherlands on the 28th of April 1939 (<span class='it'>TC-30</span>). A guarantee
was also made to Luxembourg in a speech by Hitler in the Reichstag,
in which he dealt with a communication from Mr. Roosevelt,
who was feeling a little uneasy as to Hitler’s intentions (<span class='it'>TC-42-A</span>).
In “The Nazi Plan,” a motion picture shown to the Tribunal
by the American prosecution (<span class='it'>3054-PS</span>), the delivery by Hitler of
this part of this speech was shown. Hitler appeared in one of his
jocular moods, as his words were greeted and delivered in a jocular
vein. The film shows that Goering, who sits above Hitler in
the Reichstag, appreciated very much the joke, the joke being
this: That it is an absurd suggestion to make that Germany could
possibly go to war with any of its neighbors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this speech Hitler declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Finally Mr. Roosevelt demands the readiness to give him an
assurance that the German fighting forces will not attack the
territory or possessions of the following independent nations,
and above all, that they will not march into them. And he
goes on to name the following as the countries in question:
Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Esthonia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Holland, Belgium, Great Britain, Ireland, France, Portugal,
Spain, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland,
Hungary, Rumania, Yugoslavia, Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey,
Iraq, Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Iran.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Answer: I started off by taking the trouble to find out in
the case of the countries listed, firstly, whether they feel
themselves threatened, and secondly and particularly,
whether this question Mr. Roosevelt has asked us was put as
<span class='pageno' title='764' id='Page_764'></span>
the result of a demarche by them or at least with their consent.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The answer was a general negative, which in some cases
took the form of a blunt rejection. Actually, this counter-question
of mine could not be conveyed to some of the states
and nations listed, since they are not at present in possession
of their liberty (as for instance Syria), but are occupied by
the military forces of democratic states, and therefore, deprived
of all their rights.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Thirdly, apart from that, all the states bordering on Germany
have received much more binding assurances and, above
all, much more binding proposals than Mr. Roosevelt asked
of me in his peculiar telegram.” (<span class='it'>TC-42-A</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Although that is sneering at Mr. Roosevelt, it is suggesting in
the presence, among others, of Goering, as being quite absurd
that Germany should nurture any warlike feeling against its
neighbors. The hollow falsity of that declaration and of the preceding
guarantee is shown by the minutes of Hitler’s conference
of the 23rd of May (<span class='it'>L-79</span>). The first page shows that those present
included the Fuehrer, Goering, Raeder, von Brauchitsch,
Keitel, Warlimont (Jodl’s deputy), and various others. The purpose
of the conference was an analysis of the situation, which
proceeded in this fashion:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“What will this struggle be like?”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied by armed
force. Declarations of neutrality must be ignored.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore, if England intends to intervene in the Polish
war, we must occupy Holland with lightning speed. We must
aim at securing a new defense line on Dutch soil up to the
Zuider Zee.” (<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Hitler’s speech on 22 August, the following passage occurred:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Attack from the West from the Maginot Line: I consider
this impossible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Another possibility is the violation of Dutch, Belgium, and
Swiss neutrality. I have no doubts that all these states as
well as Scandinavia will defend their neutrality by all available
means. England and France will not violate the neutrality
of these countries.” (<span class='it'>798-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, a further assurance was given by the Ambassador
of Germany to the Belgian Government:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of the gravity of the international situation, I am
<span class='pageno' title='765' id='Page_765'></span>
expressly instructed by the Head of the German Reich to
transmit to Your Majesty the following communication:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Though the German Government is at present doing everything
in its power to arrive at a peaceful solution of the
questions at issue between the Reich and Poland, it nevertheless
desires to define clearly, here and now, the attitude which
it proposes to adopt towards Belgium should a conflict in
Europe become inevitable.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Government is firmly determined to abide by
the terms of the declaration contained in the German note
of October 13, 1937. This provides in effect that Germany
will in no circumstances impair the inviolability of Belgium
and will at all times respect Belgium territory. The German
Government renews this undertaking; however, in, the expectation
that the Belgium Government, for its part, will
observe an attitude of strict neutrality and that Belgium will
tolerate no violations on the part of a third power, but that,
on the contrary, she will oppose it with all the forces at her
disposal. It goes without saying that if the Belgium Government
were to adopt a different attitude, the German Government
would naturally be compelled to defend its interests in
conformity with the new situation thus created.” (<span class='it'>TC-36</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It seems likely that the decision having been made to violate
Belgian neutrality, those last words were put in to afford some
excuse in the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A similar document assurance was communicated to Her
Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands on the same day, 26 August
1939 (<span class='it'>TC-40</span>). Likewise assurances were given to Luxembourg
at the same time. It is in the same terms as the other two assurances,
and amounts to a complete guarantee with the sting in the
tail (<span class='it'>TC-42</span>). Poland was occupied by means of a lightning victory,
and in October 1939 German armed forces were free for
other tasks. The first step that was taken, so far as the Netherlands
and Belgium are concerned, was a German assurance on 6
October 1939, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Belgium.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Immediately after I had taken over the affairs of the state
I tried to create friendly relations with Belgium. I renounced
any revision or any desire for revision. The Reich has not
made any demands which would in any way be likely to be
considered in Belgium as a threat.” (<span class='it'>TC-32</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A similar assurance was made to the Netherlands on the same
day:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The new Reich has endeavored to continue the traditional
<span class='pageno' title='766' id='Page_766'></span>
friendship with Holland. It has not taken over any existing
differences between the two countries and has not created
any new ones.” (<span class='it'>TC-32</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The value of these pledges of Germany’s good faith is shown by
an order issued on the very next day, 7 October. This order was
from the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Von Brauchitsch, and
was addressed to various Army Groups. The third paragraph
provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Dutch Border between Ems and Rhine is to be observed
only.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At the same time, Army Group B has to make all preparations
according to special orders, for immediate invasion of
Dutch and Belgian territory, if the political situation so demands.”
(<span class='it'>2329-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later, on 9 October, Hitler directed that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Preparations should be made for offensive action on the
northern flank of the Western Front crossing the area of
Luxembourg, Belgium and Holland. This attack must be
carried out as soon and as forcefully as possible. * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The object of this attack is to acquire as great an area of
Holland, Belgium and Northern France as possible.” (<span class='it'>C-62</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That document is signed by Hitler himself. It is addressed to the
Supreme Commander of the Army, Keitel; Navy, Raeder; and
Air Minister and Commander in Chief of the Air Force, Goering.
On 15 October 1939, a supplementary order was issued from the
Supreme Command of the Armed Forces. It was signed by Keitel
in his familiar red pencil signature, and was addressed to Raeder,
Goering, and the General Staff of the Army. It declared, in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It must be the object of the Army’s preparations, therefore,
to occupy—on receipt of a special order—the territory of
Holland, in the first instance as far as the Grebbe-Maas line.”
(<span class='it'>C-62</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The second paragraph deals with the taking possession of the
West-Frisian islands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear that from that moment the decision to violate the
neutrality of these three countries had been made. All that remained
was to work out the details, to wait until the weather became
favorable, and in the meantime, to give no hint that Germany’s
word was about to be broken again. Otherwise, these
small countries might have had some chance of combining with
themselves and their neighbors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another Keitel directive, again sent to the Supreme Commanders
<span class='pageno' title='767' id='Page_767'></span>
of the Army, Navy, and Air Forces, gives details of how the
attack is to be carried out. The following are pertinent passages:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Contrary to previously issued instructions, all action intended
against Holland may be carried out without a special
order which the general attack will start.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The attitude of the Dutch armed forces cannot be anticipated
ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Wherever there is no resistance, the entry should carry the
character of a peaceful occupation.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At first the Dutch area, including the West-Frisian islands
situated just off the coast, for the present without Texel, is
to be occupied up to the Grebbe-Maas line.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The 7th Airborne Division will be committed for the airborne
operation only after the possession of bridges across
the Albert Canal” (in Belgium) “has been assured.” (<span class='it'>440-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In addition to Belgium and Holland, the document, in paragraph
(5) and (6)(b) mentions Luxembourg. The signature of Keitel
is typed. It is authenticated by a staff officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A later order of 28 November 1939, over the signature of
Keitel, in the usual red pencil, is addressed to the Army, Navy,
and Airforce. It states that if a quick breakthrough should fail
north of Liege, other machinery for carrying out the attack will
be used. Paragraph 2 shows clearly that the Netherlands is to
be violated. It speaks of “The occupation of Walcheren Island
and thereby Flushing harbor, or of some other southern Dutch
island especially valuable for our sea and air warfare,” and “<span class='it'>b</span>
Taking of one or more Maas crossings between Namur and
Dinant * * *.” (<span class='it'>C-10</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>From November until March of 1940 the High Command and
the Fuehrer were waiting for favorable weather before A-Day,
as they called it. That referred to the attack on Luxembourg,
Belgium and the Netherlands. The successive postponements are
shown in a series of orders which range in date from 7 November
1939 until 9 May 1940, and which are all signed either by Keitel
or by Jodl. (<span class='it'>C-72</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 10 January 1940, a German airplane made a forced landing
in Belgium. The occupants endeavored to burn the orders of
which they were in possession, but they were only partially successful.
Among the papers which were captured is an order to
the Commander of the Second Army Group, Air Force Group—Luftflotte—the
Second Air Force Fleet, clearly for offensive action
against France, Holland, and Belgium. It deals with the disposition
<span class='pageno' title='768' id='Page_768'></span>
of the Belgian Army. The Belgian Army covers the
Liege-Antwerp Line. Then it deals with the disposition of the
Dutch Army. The German Western Army is accordingly directing
its attack between the North Sea and the Moselle, with the
strongest possible air-force support, through the Belgo-Luxembourg
region. The rest consists of operational details as to the
bombing of the various targets in Belgium and in Holland. (<span class='it'>TC-58</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nature of the Army’s planning is shown in the 1 February
1940 entry in Jodl’s diary, which reads in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Behavior of parachute units. In front of The Hague they
have to be strong enough to break in if necessary by sheer
brute force. The 7th Division intends to drop units near the
town.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Political mission contrasts to some extent with violent
action against the Dutch air force.” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The entry for 2 February 1940 states that “landings can be made
in the centre of The Hague.” On 26 February Jodl wrote:
“Fuehrer raises the question whether it is better to undertake the
Weser Exercise before or after case ‘Yellow.’ ” On 3 March, he
recorded the answer: “Fuehrer decides to carry out Weser Exercise
before case ‘Yellow’, with a few days’ interval.” And on
May 8, two days before the invasion, Jodl made this entry:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Alarming news from Holland, cancelling of furloughs,
evacuations, road-blocks, other mobilization measures; according
to reports of the intelligence service the British have
asked for permission to march in, but the Dutch have refused.”
(<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In other words, the Germans objected because the Dutch were actually
making some preparation to resist their endeavor. Furthermore,
the Dutch armies, according to the Germans’ own intelligence
reports, were still adhering properly to their neutrality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At 4:30 a. m. on 10 May, the months of planning bore fruit, and
Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg were violently invaded with
all the fury of modern warfare. No warning was given by Germany
and no complaint was made by Germany of any breaches of
neutrality before this action was taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the invasion of each of the three countries was a fait accompli,
the German Ambassador called upon representatives of
the three Governments some hours later and handed them documents
which were similar in each case, and which are described
as memoranda or ultimatums. An account of what happened in
Belgium is contained in an official Belgian report:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“From 4:30 information was received which left no shadow
<span class='pageno' title='769' id='Page_769'></span>
of doubt: the hour had struck. Aircraft were first reported
in the east. At five o’clock came news of the bombing of two
Netherlands aerodromes, the violation of the Belgian frontier,
the landing of German soldiers at the Eben-Emael Fort,
the bombing of the Jemelle station.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At 8:30 the German Ambassador came to the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs. When he entered the Minister’s room, he
began to take a paper from his pocket. M. Spaak” [Belgian
Foreign Minister] “stopped him ‘I beg your pardon, Mr. Ambassador.
I will speak first.’ And in an indignant voice, he
read the Belgian Government’s protest: ‘Mr. Ambassador,
the German Army has just attacked our country. This is the
second time in twenty-five years that Germany has committed
a criminal aggression against a neutral and loyal Belgium.
What has just happened is perhaps even more odious than
the aggression of 1914. No ultimatum, no note, no protest
of any kind has ever been placed before the Belgian Government.
It is through the attack itself that Belgium has learned
that Germany has violated the undertakings given by her on
October 13th, 1937, and renewed spontaneously at the beginning
of the war. The act of aggression committed by Germany,
for which there is no justification whatever, will deeply
shock the conscience of the world. The German Reich will
be held responsible by history. Belgium is resolved to defend
herself. Her cause, which is the cause of Right, cannot be
vanquished’.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Ambassador was then able to read the note he had
brought: ‘I am instructed by the Government of the Reich,’
he said, ‘to make the following declaration: In order to forestall
the invasion of Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg, for
which Great Britain and France have been making preparations
clearly aimed at Germany, the Government of the Reich
is compelled to ensure the neutrality of the three countries
mentioned by means of arms. For this purpose, the Government
of the Reich will bring up an armed force of the greatest
size, so that resistance of any kind will be useless. The
Government of the Reich guarantees Belgium’s European and
colonial territory, as well as her dynasty, on condition that
no resistance is offered. Should there be any resistance, Belgium
will risk the destruction of her country and loss of her
independence. It is therefore, in the interests of Belgium
that the population be called upon to cease all resistance and
<span class='pageno' title='770' id='Page_770'></span>
that the authorities be given the necessary instructions to

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The so-called ultimatum, which was delivered some hours after
the invasion had started, read in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Government has for a long time had no doubts
as to what was the chief aim of the British and French war
policy. It consists of the spreading of the war to other countries,
and of the misuse of their peoples as auxiliary and mercenary
troops for England and France.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The last attempt of this sort was the plan to occupy Scandinavia
with the help of Norway, in order to set up a new
front against Germany in this region. It was only Germany’s
last minute action which upset the project. Germany has
furnished documentary evidence of this before the eyes of
the world.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Immediately after the British-French action in Scandinavia
miscarried, England and France took up their policy of war
expansion in another direction. In this respect, while the retreat
in flight of the British troops from Norway was still
going on, the English Prime Minister announced that, as a
result of the altered situation in Scandinavia, England was
once more in a position to go ahead with the transfer of the
full weight of her navy to the Mediterranean, and that English
and French units were already on the way to Alexandria.
The Mediterranean now became the center of English-French
war propaganda. This was partly to gloss over the Scandinavian
defeat and the big loss of prestige before their own
people and before the world, and partly to make it appear
that the Balkans had been chosen for the next theater of war
against Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In reality, however, this apparent shifting to the Mediterranean
of English-French war policy had quite another purpose.
It was nothing but a diversion manoeuvre in grand
style, to deceive Germany as to the direction of the next
English-French attack. For, as the Reich Government has
long been aware, the true aim of England and France is the
<span class='pageno' title='771' id='Page_771'></span>
carefully prepared and now immediately imminent attack on
Germany in the West, so as to advance through Belgium and
Holland to the region of the Ruhr.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany has recognized and respected the inviolability of
Belgium and Holland, it being of course understood that these
two countries in the event of a war of Germany against
England and France would maintain the strictest neutrality.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Belgium and the Netherlands have not fulfilled this condition.”
(<span class='it'>TC-57</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The so-called ultimatum goes on to complain of the hostile expressions
in the Belgian and the Netherlands Press, and to allege
attempts by the British Intelligence to bring a revolution into
Germany with the assistance of Belgium and the Netherlands.
Reference is made to military preparation of the two countries,
and it is pointed out that Belgium has fortified the Belgian frontier.
A complaint was made in regard to Holland, that British
aircraft had flown over the Netherlands country. Other charges
were made against the neutrality of these two countries, although
no instances were given (<span class='it'>TC-57</span>). The document continued:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In this struggle for existence forced upon the German people
by England and France, the Reich Government is not disposed
to await submissively the attack by England and
France and to allow them to carry the war over Belgium and
the Netherlands into German territory. It has therefore now
issued the command to German troops to ensure the neutrality
of these countries by all the military means at the disposal
of the Reich.” (<span class='it'>TC-57</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is unnecessary, in view of the documents previously adverted
to, to emphasize the falsity of that statement. It is now known
that for months preparations had been made to violate the neutrality
of these three countries. This document is merely saying,
“The orders to do so have now been issued.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A similar document, similar in terms altogether, was handed to
the representatives of the Netherlands Government; and a memorandum
was sent to the Luxembourg Government, which enclosed
with it a copy of the document handed to the Governments of
Belgium and the Netherlands. The second paragraph of the latter
declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In defense against the imminent attack, the German troops
have now received the order to safeguard the neutrality of
these two countries * * *”. (<span class='it'>TC-60</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The protest of the Belgium Government against the crime
which was committed against her is contained in <span class='it'>TC-59</span>.

which took place in the early hours of the morning of 6 April 1941,
constituted direct breaches of The Hague Convention of 1899 on
the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, and of the Kellogg-Briand
Pact of 1928. In the case of Yugoslavia, the invasion
further constituted a breach of an express assurance by the Nazis.
<span class='pageno' title='776' id='Page_776'></span>
The assurance was originally given in a German Foreign Office
release made in Berlin on 28 April 1938 (<span class='it'>2719-PS</span>), but was subsequently
repeated by Hitler himself on 6 October 1939 in a speech
he made in the Reichstag. The German Foreign Office release on
28 April 1938 reads, in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Berlin, 28 April 1938. The State Secretary of the German
Foreign Office to the German Diplomatic Representatives.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As a consequence of the reunion of Austria with the Reich,
we have now new frontiers with Italy, Yugoslavia, Switzerland,
Liechtenstein, and Hungary. These frontiers are regarded
by us as final and inviolable. On this point the following
special declarations have been made:”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Yugoslavia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Yugoslav Government have been informed by authoritative
German quarters that German policy has no aims beyond
Austria, and that the Yugoslav frontier would in any
case remain untouched. In his speech made at Graz on 3
April, the Fuehrer and Chancellor stated that, in regard to
the reunion of Austria, Yugoslavia and Hungary had adopted
the same attitude as Italy. We were happy to have frontiers
there which relieved us of all anxiety about providing military
protection for them.” (<span class='it'>2719-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech made on the occasion of the dinner in honor of the
Prince Regent of Yugoslavia on 1 June 1939, Hitler declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German friendship for the Yugoslav nation is not only
a spontaneous one. It gained depth and durability in the
midst of the tragic confusion of the world war. The German
soldier then learned to appreciate and respect his extremely
brave opponent. I believe that this feeling was reciprocated.
This mutual respect finds confirmation in common political,
cultural and economic interests. We therefore look upon
your Royal Highness’s present visit as a living proof of the
accuracy of our view, and at the same time on that account
we derive from it the hope that German-Yugoslav friendship
may continue further to develop in the future and to grow
ever closer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the presence of your Royal Highness, however, we also
perceive a happy opportunity for a frank and friendly exchange
of views which, and of this I am convinced, in this
sense can only be fruitful to our two peoples and States. I
believe this all the more because a firmly established reliable
relationship of Germany to Yugoslavia, now that, owing to
historical events, we have become neighbors with common
<span class='pageno' title='777' id='Page_777'></span>
boundaries fixed for all time, will not only guarantee lasting
peace between our two peoples and countries, but can also
represent an element of calm to our nerve-wracked continent.
This peace is the goal of all who are disposed to perform
really constructive work.” (<span class='it'>TC-92</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As is now known this speech was made at the time when Hitler
had already decided upon the European war. It occurred a week
after the Reichschancellery conference recorded in the Schmundt
note (<span class='it'>L-79</span>). The reference to “nerve-wracked continent” might
perhaps be attributed to the war of nerves which Hitler had himself
been conducting for many months. The German Assurance
to Yugoslavia on 6 October 1939 was in these terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Immediately after the completion of the Anschluss I informed
Yugoslavia that, from now on, the frontier with this
country would also be an unalterable one, and that we only
desire to live in peace and friendship with her.” (<span class='it'>TC-43</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Planning for Invasion: Collaboration with Italy and Bulgaria.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite the obligation of Germany, under the Convention of
1899, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and under the foregoing Assurance
which I have read, the fate of both Greece and Yugoslavia
had, as is now known, been sealed ever since the meeting
between Hitler, Ribbentrop, and Ciano at Obersalzberg, 12 and
13 August 1939 (<span class='it'>TC-77</span>). The effect of the meeting was that
Hitler and Ribbentrop, only two months after the dinner to the
Prince Regent, were seeking to persuade Italy to make war on
Yugoslavia at the same time that Germany was to commence hostilities
against Poland, which Hitler had decided to do in the very
near future. Ciano while evidently in entire agreement with Hitler
and Ribbentrop as to the desirability of liquidating Yugoslavia,
and while himself anxious to secure Salonika, stated that
Italy was not yet ready for a general European war. Thus, despite
all the persuasion which Hitler and Ribbentrop exerted at
the meeting, it became necessary for the Nazi conspirators to reassure
their intended victim, Yugoslavia, since in fact Italy
maintained its position and did not enter the war when Germany
invaded Poland, and since the Germans themselves were not yet
ready to strike in the Balkans. If was apparently for this reason
that on 6 October, through Hitler’s speech, the Nazis repeated
the assurance they had made in April 1938. It is a matter of
history that after the defeat of the Allied Armies in May and
June 1940, the Italian Government declared war on France and
that subsequently, at three o’clock in the morning on 28 October
<span class='pageno' title='778' id='Page_778'></span>
1940, the Italian Minister at Athens presented the Greek Government
with a 3 hour ultimatum, upon the expiration of which
Italian troops were already invading the soil of Greece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This event was reported by the British Minister at Athens in
these words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The president of the council has assured himself an outstanding
place in Greek history and, whatever the future
may bring, his foresight in quietly preparing his country for
war and his courage in rejecting without demur the Italian
ultimatum when delivered in the small hours of that October
morning, will surely obtain an honorable mention in the story
of European statecraft. He means to fight until Italy is completely
defeated and this reflects the purpose of the whole
Greek nation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A letter from Hitler to Mussolini, which is undated but which—this
is clear from the contents—must have been written shortly
after the Italian invasion of Greece on 28 November [transcriber note: October] 1940, contained
these sentiments:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Jugoslavia must become disinterested, if possible however
from our point of view interested in cooperating in the
liquidation of the Greek question. Without assurances from
Jugoslavia, it is useless to risk any successful operation in
the Balkans.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Unfortunately, I must stress the fact that waging a war
in the Balkans before March is impossible. Therefore, any
threatening move towards Jugoslavia would be useless, since
the impossibility of a materialization of such threats before
March is well known to the Serbian general staff. Therefore,
Jugoslavia must, if at all possible, be won over by
other means and other ways.” (<span class='it'>2762-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this time that Hitler was making his plans for the
offensive in the Spring of 1941, which included the invasion of
Greece from the north. It was an integral part of those plans
that Yugoslavia should be induced to cooperate in them or at
least to maintain a disinterested attitude towards the liquidation
of the other Balkan States. These facts are disclosed in a
“Top Secret Directive” issued from the Fuehrer’s Headquarters,
signed by Hitler, initialed by Jodl, and dated 12 November 1940.
This order reads, in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Directive No. 18.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The preparatory measures of Supreme HQ for the prosecution
of the war in the near future are to be made along the
following lines.* * *” (<span class='it'>444-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='779' id='Page_779'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>After sections dealing with operations against Gibraltar and
an offensive against Egypt, the order continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Balkans</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The commanders-in-chief of the Army will make preparations
for occupying the Greek mainland north of the Aegean
Sea in case of need, entering through Bulgaria, and thus
make possible the use of German air force units against targets
in the Eastern Mediterranean, in particular against
those English air bases which are threatening the Rumanian
oil area.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In order to be able to face all eventualities and to keep
Turkey in check, the use of an army group of an approximate
strength of ten divisions is to be the basis for the
planning and the calculations of deployment. It will not be
possible to count on the railway, leading through Yugoslavia,
for moving these forces into position.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“So as to shorten the time needed for the deployment, preparations
will be made for an early increase in the German
Army mission in Roumania, the extent of which must be
submitted to me.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>The commander-in-chief of the Air Force</span> will make preparations
for the use of German Air Force units in the South
East Balkans and for aerial reconnaissance on the southern
border of Bulgaria, in accordance with the intended ground
operations.” (<span class='it'>444-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The positions of the Italian invading forces in Greece in
December 1940 may be summarized in the words in which the
British Minister reported to Foreign Secretary Eden:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The morale of the Greek Army throughout has been of the
highest, and our own naval and land successes at Tarento
and in the Western Desert have done much to maintain it.
With relatively poor armaments and the minimum of equipment
and modern facilities they have driven back or captured
superior Italian forces more frequently than not at
the point of the bayonet. The modern Greeks have thus
shown that they are not unworthy of the ancient tradition
of their country and that they, like their distant forbears,
are prepared to fight against odds to maintain their freedom.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In fact, the Italians were getting the worst of it, and it was time
that Hitler came to the rescue with the order for the German
attack on Greece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Directive of 13 December 1940, which is Top Secret
Directive number 20, dealing with Operation <span class='it'>Marita</span>, bears a
<span class='pageno' title='780' id='Page_780'></span>
distribution list which shows that copies went to the Commander
of the Navy (Raeder), to the Commander of the Air Force
(Goering), to the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces
(Keitel), and to the Command Staff (Jodl). The first two paragraphs
state:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The result of the battles in Albania is not yet decisive.
Because of a dangerous situation in Albania it is doubly
necessary that the British endeavour be foiled to create air
bases under the protection of a Balkan front, which would
be dangerous above all to Italy as well as to the Rumanian
oil fields.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“My plan, therefore, is (<span class='it'>a</span>) to form a slowly increasing task
force in Southern Rumania within the next months. (<span class='it'>b</span>)
After the setting in of favorable weather, probably in
March, to send the task force for the occupation of the
Aegean North coast by way of Bulgaria, and if necessary
to occupy the entire Greek mainland (Operation <span class='it'>Marita</span>).
The support of Bulgaria is to be expected.” (<span class='it'>1541-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next paragraph gives the forces for the operation, and
paragraph 4 deals with the operation Marita itself. Paragraph
5 states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Military preparations which will produce exceptional
political results in the Balkans demand the exact control of
all the necessary measures by the General Staff. The
transport through Hungary and the arrival in Rumania
will be reported step by step by the General Staff of the
Armed Forces, and are to be explained at first as a strengthening
of the German Army mission in Rumania.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Consultations with the Rumanians or the Bulgarians which
may point to our intentions as well as notification of the
Italians are each subject to my consent, also the sending
of scouting missions and advanced parties.” (<span class='it'>1541-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another “Top Secret Directive” carries the plan a little farther.
It deals with decisive action in support of the Italian
forces in Tripoli and in Albania. The first short paragraph reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The situation in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations
demands for strategical political and psychological reasons
German assistance, due to employment of superior forces by
England against our allies.” (<span class='it'>448-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Paragraph three, after dealing with the forces to be transferred
to Albania, sets out what the duties of the German forces will be:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> To serve in Albania for the time being as a reserve for
an emergency case, should new crises arise there.
<span class='pageno' title='781' id='Page_781'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> To ease the burden of the Italian Army group when
later attacking with the aim:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“To tear open the Greek defense front on a decisive point for
a far-reaching operation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“To open up the straits west of Salonika from the back in
order to support thereby the frontal attack of List’s Army.”
(<span class='it'>448-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That directive was signed by Hitler, and, as shown on the original,
was initialed by both Keitel and Jodl. A copy went to Raeder,
and the copy sent to Foreign Intelligence presumably reached
Ribbentrop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A conference took place on 19 and 20 January between Keitel
and the Italian General, Guzzoni. This was followed by a meeting
between Hitler and Mussolini, at which Ribbentrop, Keitel,
and Jodl were present. In the speech which the Fuehrer made
on 20 January 1941, after the conference with the Italians, he
declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The massing of troops in Roumania serves a
threefold purpose:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> An operation against Greece.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> Protection of Bulgaria against Russia and Turkey.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> Safeguarding the guarantee to Roumania.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Each of these tasks requires its own group of forces, altogether
therefore very strong forces whose deployment far
from our base requires a long time.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Desirable that this deployment is completed without interference
from the enemy. Therefore disclose the game as late
as possible. The tendency will be to cross the Danube at the
last possible moment and to line up for attack at the earliest
possible moment.” (<span class='it'>C-134</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At a conference between Field Marshal List and the Bulgarians,
on 8 February, the following plans were discussed:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Minutes of questions discussed between the representatives
of the Royal Bulgarian General Staff and the German Supreme
Command—General Field Marshal List—in connection
with the possible movement of German troops through
Bulgaria and their commitment against Greece and possibly
against Turkey, if she should involve herself in the war.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The Bulgarian and the German general staff will
take all measures in order to camouflage the preparation of
the operations and to assure in this way the most favorable
conditions for the execution of the German operations as
planned.
<span class='pageno' title='782' id='Page_782'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The representatives of the two general staffs consider it to
be suitable to inform their governments that it will be good
to take the necessity of secrecy and surprise into consideration
when the three-power treaty is signed by Bulgaria, in
order to assure the success of the military operations.”
(<span class='it'>1746-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A further top secret directive of 19 February sets the date for
the Operation <span class='it'>Marita</span> (<span class='it'>C-59</span>). It states that the bridge across
the Danube is to be begun on 28 February, the river crossed on
2 March, and the final orders to be issued on 26 February at the
latest. On the original of this order the actual dates are filled in
in the handwriting of Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The position of Bulgaria at this moment was this: Bulgaria
adhered to the Three-Power Pact on 1 March 1941. On the same
day the entry of German troops into Bulgaria began in accordance
with the Plan <span class='it'>Marita</span> and associated directives already referred
to. The landing of British troops in Greece on 3 March, in accordance
with the guarantee given in the spring of 1939 by the
British Government, may have accelerated the movement of the
German forces. In any event, as has been shown, the invasion of
Greece had been planned long beforehand and was already in
progress at this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short extract from a report by Raeder on an interview with
Hitler, which the original shows took place in the presence of
Keitel and Jodl at 1600 hours on 18 March, shows the ruthless
nature of the German intentions:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The C in C of the Navy asks for confirmation that the
whole of Greece will have to be occupied even in the event
of a peaceful settlement.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Fuehrer</span>: The complete occupation is a prerequisite of any
settlement.” (<span class='it'>C-167</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This report shows, it seems clear, that the Nazi conspirators, in
accordance with their principle of liquidating any neutral which
did not remain disinterested, had made every preparation by
the end of January and were at this date in the process of moving
the necessary troops to ensure the final liquidation of Greece,
which was already at war with, and getting the better of, their
Italian allies.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Lulling the Unsuspecting Victim.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>They were not yet, however, ready to deal with Yugoslavia,
towards which their policy accordingly remained one of lulling
the unsuspecting victim. On 25 March, in accordance with this
policy, the adherence of Yugoslavia to the Three-Power Pact
<span class='pageno' title='783' id='Page_783'></span>
was secured. This adherence followed a visit on 15 February
1941 by the Yugoslav Premier Cvetkovic and the Foreign Minister
Cinkar-Markvic to Ribbentrop at Salzburg and subsequently
to Hitler at Berchtesgaden, after which these ministers were induced
to sign the Pact at Vienna on 25 March. On this occasion
Ribbentrop wrote the two letters of assurance. The first made
this guarantee:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Notes of the Axis Governments to Belgrade.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At the same time, when the protocol on the entry of Yugoslavia
to the Tri-Partite Pact was signed, the governments
of the Axis Powers sent to the Yugoslavian Government the
following identical notes:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘Mr. Prime Minister:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘In the name of the German Government and at its behest,
I have the honor to inform Your Excellency of the following:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘On the occasion of the Yugoslavian entry today into the
Tri-Partite Pact, the German Government confirms its determination
to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of Yugoslavia at all times.’ ” (<span class='it'>2450-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That letter was signed by Ribbentrop, who was present at the
meeting in August 1939 when he and Hitler tried to persuade
the Italians to invade Yugoslavia. It was in fact 11 days after
this letter was written that the Germans did invade Yugoslavia,
and two days after the letter was written that they issued the
necessary order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second letter reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Mr. Prime Minister:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“With reference to the conversations that occurred in connection
with the Yugoslavian entry into the Tri-Partite
Pact, I have the honor to confirm to Your Excellency herewith
in the name of the Reich Cabinet [Reichsregierung], that
in the agreement between the Axis powers and the Royal
Yugoslavian Government, the governments of the Axis
powers during this war will not direct a demand to Yugoslavia
to permit the march or transportation of troops
through Yugoslavian national territory.” (<span class='it'>2450-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The position at this stage, 25 March 1941, was therefore that
German troops were already in Bulgaria moving towards the
Greek frontier, while Yugoslavia had, to use Hitler’s own term
in his letter to Mussolini, “become disinterested” in the cleaning
up of the Greek question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of the adherence of Yugoslavia to the Three-Power
Pact appears very clearly from an extract from the
<span class='pageno' title='784' id='Page_784'></span>
minutes of a meeting between Hitler and Ciano. The first paragraph
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer first expressed his satisfaction with Yugoslavia’s
joining the Tri-Partite Pact and the resulting definition
of her position. This is of special importance in view
of the proposed military action against Greece, for, if one
considers that for 350 to 400 kilometers the important line
of communication through Bulgaria runs within 20 kilometers
of the Yugoslav border, one can judge that with a
dubious attitude of Yugoslavia an undertaking against
Greece would have been militarily an extremely foolhardy
venture.” (<span class='it'>2765-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again, it is a matter of history that on the night of 26 March
1941, when the two Yugoslav ministers returned to Belgrade,
General Simovic and his colleagues effected their removal by a
<span class='it'>coup d’état</span>, and Yugoslavia emerged on the morning of 27
March ready to defend, if need be, its independence.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>Further Planning for Attack.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis reacted rapidly to this altered situation, and the immediate
liquidation of Yugoslavia was decided on. A conference
of Hitler and the German High Command on the situation in
Yugoslavia took place on 27 March 1941. Those present included
the Fuehrer; the Reich Marshall (Goering); Chief, OKW,
(Keitel); and the Chief of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht Fuehrungstab</span>, (Jodl).
A report of the conference notes that “later on the following persons
were added,” and among them is included Ribbentrop
(<span class='it'>1746-PS</span>). Hitler’s statement proceeded as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer describes Yugoslavia’s situation after the <span class='it'>coup
d’état</span>. Statement that Yugoslavia was an uncertain factor
in regard to the coming Marita action and even more in regard
to the Barbarossa undertaking later on. Serbs and
Slovenes were never pro-German.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The present moment is for political and military reasons
favorable for us to ascertain the actual situation in the country
and the country’s attitude toward us, for if the overthrow
of the Government would have happened during the Barbarossa
action, the consequences for us probably would have
been considerably more serious.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer is determined, without waiting for possible
loyalty declarations of the new government, to make all preparations
in order to destroy Yugoslavia militarily and as a
<span class='pageno' title='785' id='Page_785'></span>
national unit. No diplomatic inquiries will be made nor ultimatums
presented. Assurances of the Yugoslav government,
which cannot be trusted anyhow in the future will be
taken note of. The attack will start as soon as the means
and troops suitable for it are ready.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is important that actions will be taken as fast as possible.
An attempt will be made to let the bordering states participate
in a suitable way. An actual military support against
Yugoslavia is to be requested of Italy, Hungary, and in certain
respects of Bulgaria too. Roumania’s main task is the
protection against Russia. The Hungarian and the Bulgarian
ambassador have already been notified. During the day
a message will still be addressed to the Duce.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Politically, it is especially important that the blow against
Yugoslavia is carried out with unmerciful harshness and that
the military destruction is done in a lightning-like undertaking.
In this way, Turkey would become sufficiently frightened
and the campaign against Greece later on would be influenced
in a favorable way. It can be assumed that the
Croats will come to our side when we attack. A corresponding
political treatment (autonomy later on) will be assured
to them. The war against Yugoslavia should be very popular
in Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria, as territorial acquisitions
are to be promised to these states; the Adria coast for Italy,
the Banat for Hungary, and Macedonia for Bulgaria.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This plan assumes that we speed up the schedule of all
preparations and use such strong forces that the Yugoslav
collapse will take place within the shortest time.” (<span class='it'>1746-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it appears that two days after Yugoslavia had signed the
Tri-Partite Pact and the Nazis had given assurances, simply because
there had been a <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> and it was possible that the
operations against Greece might be affected, the destruction of
Yugoslavia was decided on without any question of taking the
trouble to ascertain the views of the new Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report of the meeting continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“5. The main task of the Air Force is to start as early as possible
with the destruction of the Yugoslavian Air Force
ground installations and to destroy the capital Belgrade in
attacks by waves.” (<span class='it'>1746-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is again a matter of history that the residential areas of Belgrade
were bombed at 7 o’clock on the following Sunday morning,
6 April 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that same meeting of 27 March 1941 a tentative plan, drawn
up by Jodl, was offered:
<span class='pageno' title='786' id='Page_786'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the event that the political development requires an
armed intervention against Yugoslavia, it is the German intention
to attack Yugoslavia in a concentric way as soon as
possible, to destroy her armed forces, and to dissolve her
national territory.” (<span class='it'>1746-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An order (Directive No. 25) was issued after the meeting of
27 March. The first paragraph reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The military putsch in Yugoslavia has altered the political
situation in the Balkans. Yugoslavia must, in spite of her
protestations of loyalty, for the time being be considered as
an enemy and therefore be crushed as speedily as possible.”
(<span class='it'>C-127</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As another result of the meeting, a telegram, containing a letter
from Hitler to Mussolini, was forwarded to the German Ambassador
in Rome by Hitler and Ribbentrop. It was written to advise
Mussolini of the course decided on, and under the guise of
somewhat fulsome language the Duce was given his orders. The
first five paragraphs read:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Duce, Events force me to give you, Duce, by this the quickest
means, my estimation of the situation and the consequences
which may result from it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(1) From the beginning I have regarded Yugoslavia as a
dangerous factor in the controversy with Greece. Considered
from the purely military point of view, German intervention
in the war in Thrace would not be at all justified, as
long as the attitude of Yugoslavia remains ambiguous and
she could threaten the left flank of the advancing columns,
on our enormous front.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(2) For this reason I have done everything and honestly
have endeavored to bring Yugoslavia into our community
bound together by mutual interests. Unfortunately these endeavors
did not meet with success, or they were begun too late
to produce any definite result. Today’s reports leave no
doubt as to the imminent turn in the foreign policy of Yugoslavia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(3) I don’t consider this situation as being catastrophic,
but nevertheless a difficult one, and we on our part must
avoid any mistake if we do not want in the end to endanger
our whole position.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(4) Therefore I have already arranged for all necessary
measures in order to meet a critical development with necessary
military means. The change in the deployment of our
troops has been ordered also in Bulgaria. Now I would cordially
request you, Duce, not to undertake any further operations
<span class='pageno' title='787' id='Page_787'></span>
in Albania in the course of the next few days. I consider
it necessary that you should cover and screen the most important
passes from Yugoslavia into Albania with all available
forces.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“These measures should not be considered as designed for a
long period of time, but as auxiliary measures designed to
prevent for at least fourteen days to three weeks a crisis
arising.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I also consider it necessary, Duce, that you should reinforce
your forces on the Italian-Yugoslav front with all available
means and with utmost speed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(5) I also consider it necessary, Duce, that everything
which we do and order be shrouded in absolute secrecy and
that only personalities who necessarily must be notified
know anything about them. These measures will completely
lose their value should they become known.” (<span class='it'>1835-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Hitler continues with a further emphasis on the importance of
secrecy. An operational order (<span class='it'>R-95</span>) followed, which was signed
by General von Brauchitsch, and which merely passed to the
Armies the orders contained in Directive No. 25. (<span class='it'>C-127</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>E. <span class='it'>Explanations.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia took place in the morning
of 6 April 1941. On that day Hitler issued a proclamation
(<span class='it'>TC-93</span>). The following passage is an extract:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“From the beginning of the struggle it has been England’s
steadfast endeavor to make the Balkans a theatre of war.
British diplomacy did, in fact, using the model of the World
War, succeed in first ensnaring Greece by a guarantee offered
to her, and then finally in misusing her for Britain’s
purposes.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The documents published today [the German ‘White Book’]
afford a glimpse of a practice which, in accordance with very
old British recipes, is a constant attempt to induce others to
fight and bleed for British interests.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the face of this I have always emphasized that:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(1) The German people have no antagonism to the Greek
people but that</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(2) We shall never, as in the World War, tolerate a power
establishing itself on Greek territory with the object at a
given time of being able to advance thence from the southeast
into German living space. We have swept the northern
flank free of the English; we are resolved not to tolerate
such a threat in the south.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='788' id='Page_788'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the interests of a genuine consolidation of Europe it has
been my endeavor since the day of my assumption of power
above all to establish a friendly relationship with Yugoslavia.
I have consciously put out of mind everything that once took
place between Germany and Serbia. I have not only offered
the Serbian people the hand of the German people, but in
addition have made efforts as an honest broker to assist in
bridging all difficulties which existed between the Yugoslav
State and various Nations allied to Germany.” (<span class='it'>TC-93</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>One can only think that when he issued that proclamation Hitler
must momentarily have forgotten the meeting with Ciano in
August 1939, and the meeting with Ribbentrop and the others
on 27 March, a few days earlier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a lecture delivered by Jodl on 7 November 1943, he sets out
his views, two and a half years later on the action taken in
April, 1941. In Paragraph 11 he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“What was, however, less acceptable was the necessity of
affording our assistance as an Ally in the Balkans in consequence
of the ‘extra-turn’ of the Italians against Greece.
The attack, which they launched in the autumn of 1940 from
Albania with totally inadequate means was contrary to all
agreement but in the end led to a decision on our part which—taking
a long view of the matter—would have become
necessary in any case sooner or later. The planned attack
on Greece from the North was not executed merely as an
operation in aid of an ally. Its real purpose was to prevent
the British from gaining a foothold in Greece and from
menacing our Roumanian oil area from that country.”
(<span class='it'>L-172</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>F. <span class='it'>Summary.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>To summarize: The invasion of Greece was decided on at
least as early as November or December 1940 and was scheduled
for the end of March or the beginning of April, 1941. No consideration
was at any time given to any obligations under treaties
or conventions which might make such invasion a breach of International
Law. Care was taken to conceal the preparations so
that the German Forces might have an unsuspecting victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile, Yugoslavia, although to be liquidated in due
course, was clearly better left for a later stage. Every effort
was made to secure her cooperation for the offensive against
Greece, or at least to ensure that she would abstain from any
interference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> of General Simovic upset this plan and it was
<span class='pageno' title='789' id='Page_789'></span>
then decided that, irrespective of whether or not his Government
had any hostile intentions towards Germany, or even of supporting
the Greeks, Yugoslavia must be liquidated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not worth while to the Nazis to take any steps to ascertain
Yugoslavia’s intentions, for it would be so little trouble,
now that the German troops were deployed, to destroy her militarily
and as a national unit. Accordingly, in the early hours of
Sunday morning, 6 April 1941, German troops marched into
Yugoslavia without warning and into Greece simultaneously.
The formality was observed of handing a note to the Greek
Minister in Berlin, informing him that the German forces were
entering Greece to drive out the British. M. Koryzis, the Greek
Minister, in replying to information of the invasion from the
German Embassy, replied that history was repeating itself and
that Greece was being attacked by Germany in the same way as
by Italy. Greece returned, he said, the same reply as it had given
to the Italians in the preceding October.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>G. <span class='it'>The Pattern of Aggression.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one common factor which runs through the whole of
the Nazi aggressions. It is an element in the diplomatic technique
of aggression, which was used with singular consistency,
not only by the Nazis themselves, but also by their Italian friends.
Their technique was essentially based upon securing the maximum
advantage from surprise, even though only a few hours of
unopposed military advance into the country of the unsuspecting
victim could thus be secured. Thus, there was, of course,
no declaration of war in the case of Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The invasion of Norway and of Denmark began in the small
hours of the night of April 8-9 1940, and was well under way as
a military operation, before the diplomatic explanations and
excuses were presented to the Danish Foreign Minister, at 4:20
a. m. on the morning of the 9th, and to the Norwegian Minister,
between half past four and five on that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The invasion of Belgium, Luxembourg, and Holland began not
later than five o’clock, in the small hours of 10 of May, 1940,
while the formal ultimatum, delivered in each case with the
diplomatic excuses and explanations, was not presented until
afterwards. In the ease of Holland the invasion began between
three and four in the morning. It was not until about six, when
The Hague had already been bombed, that the German Minister
asked to see M. van Kleffens. In the case of Belgium, where the
bombing began at five, the German Minister did not see M. Spaak
<span class='pageno' title='790' id='Page_790'></span>
until eight. The invasion of Luxembourg began at four and it
was at seven when the German Minister asked to see M. Beck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mussolini copied this technique. It was 3 o’clock on the morning
of 28 October 1940 when his Minister in Athens presented a
three hour ultimatum to General Metaxas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia, also, both began in
the small hours of 6 April 1941. In the case of Yugoslavia no
diplomatic exchange took place even after the event, but a
proclamation was issued by Hitler at five o’clock that Sunday
morning, some two hours before Belgrade was bombed. In the
case of Greece, it was at twenty minutes past five that M.
Koryzis was informed that German troops were entering Greek
territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manner in which this long series of aggressions was
carried out is, in itself, further evidence of the essentially aggressive
and treacherous character of the Nazi regime: to attack
without warning at night to secure an initial advantage,
and to proffer excuses or reasons afterwards. This is clearly
the method of the State which has no respect for its own pledged
word, nor for the rights of any people but its own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is impossible not to speculate whether this technique was
evolved by the “honest broker” himself or by his honest clerk,
Ribbentrop.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg794a'>12. AGGRESSION AGAINST THE U.S.S.R.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Inception of the Plan.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The point of departure for the story of the aggression against
the Soviet Union is the date, 23 August 1939. On that day—just
a week before the invasion of Poland—the Nazi conspirators
caused Germany to enter into the Treaty of Non-Aggression with
the U.S.S.R. This Treaty (<span class='it'>TC-25</span>) contained two significant
articles:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 1: The two contracting parties undertake to refrain
from any act of violence, any aggressive action, or any attack
against one another, whether individually or jointly
with other powers.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 5: Should disputes or conflicts arise between the
contracting parties regarding questions of any kind whatsoever,
the two partners would clear away these disputes or
conflicts solely by friendly exchanges of views or if necessary
by arbitration commission.” (<span class='it'>TC-25</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Treaty was signed for the U.S.S.R. by the Soviet Foreign
Minister Molotov, and for the German Government by Ribbentrop.
Its announcement came as somewhat of a surprise to the
world, since it appeared to constitute a reversal of the previous
trend of Nazi foreign policy. The explanation for this about face
was provided, however, by Ribbentrop himself, in a discussion
which he had with the Japanese Ambassador, Oshima, at Fuchel
on 23 February 1941. A report of that conference was forwarded
by Ribbentrop to certain German diplomats in the field for their
strictly confidential and purely personal information (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>).
Ribbentrop told Oshima the reason for the Pact with the U.S.S.R.
in the following words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Then when it came to war the Fuehrer decided on a treaty
with Russia—a necessity for avoiding a two-front war. Perhaps
this moment was difficult for Japan. The treaty was,
however, in the interest of Japan, for the Japanese empire
was interested in as rapid a German victory as possible,
which was assured by the treaty with Russia.” (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In view of this spirit of opportunism which motivated the Nazi
Conspirators in entering into this solemn pledge of arbitration
and nonaggression, it is not surprising to find that they regarded
it, as they did all Treaties and Pledges, as binding on them only
so long as it was expedient for them to do so. That they did so
regard it is evident from the fact that, even while the campaign
in the West was still in progress, they began to consider the possibility
<span class='pageno' title='795' id='Page_795'></span>
of launching a war of aggression against the U.S.S.R.
In a speech to the Reichsleiters and Gauleiters at Munich in November
1943, Jodl admitted that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Parallel with all these developments realization was steadily
growing of the danger drawing constantly nearer from the
Bolshevik East—that danger which has been only too little
perceived in Germany and latterly, for diplomatic reasons,
had deliberately to be ignored. However, the Fuehrer
himself has always kept this danger steadily in view and
even as far back as during the Western Campaign had informed
me of his fundamental decision to take steps against
this danger the moment our military position made it at all
possible.” (<span class='it'>L-172</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the time this statement was made, however, the Western
Campaign was still in progress and so any action in the East necessarily
had to be postponed for the time being. On 22 June
1940, however, the Franco-German armistice was signed at Compiegne
and the campaign in the West, with the exception of the
war against Britain, came to an end. The view that Germany’s
key to political and economic dominance lay in the elimination of
the U.S.S.R. as a political factor, and in the acquisition of <span class='it'>lebensraum</span>
at her expense, had long been basic in Nazi ideology. This
idea had never been completely forgotten, even while the war in
the West was in progress. Now, flushed with the recent success
of their arms and yet keenly conscious of both their failure to
defeat Britain and the needs of their armies for food and raw
materials, the Nazi conspirators began serious consideration of
the means for achieving their traditional ambition by conquering
the Soviet Union. The situation in which Germany now found
herself made such action appear both desirable and practicable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As early as August of 1940, General Thomas received a hint
from Goering that planning for a campaign against the Soviet
Union was already under way. Thomas at that time was the
Chief of the <span class='it'>Wirtschaft Rustung Amt</span>, or Office for Economy and
Armaments, of the OKW (<span class='it'>Wi Rue Amt</span>). General Thomas tells
about receiving this information from Goering in his draft of a
work entitled “Basic Facts For a History of German War and
Armaments Economy,” which he prepared during the Summer of
1944 (<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>). On pages 313 to 315 of this work, Thomas discusses
the Russo-German trade agreement of 1939 and relates
that, since the Soviets were delivering quickly and well under this
agreement and were requesting war materials in return, there was
much pressure in Germany until early 1940 for increased delivery
on the part of the Germans. However, at page 315 he has the
<span class='pageno' title='796' id='Page_796'></span>
following to say about the change of heart expressed by the German
leaders in August of 1940:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On August 14, the Chief of Wi Rue, during a conference
with Reichmarshal Goering, was informed, that the Fuehrer
desired punctual delivery to the Russians only till spring
1941. Later on we would have no further interest in completely
satisfying the Russian demands. This allusion moved
the Chief of Wi Rue to give priority to matters concerning
Russian War Economy.” (<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This statement will be referred to again later in the discussion
of preparations for the economic exploitation of Soviet territory.
At that time too, evidence will be presented that in November of
1940 Goering categorically informed Thomas that a campaign
was planned against the U.S.S.R.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Preparations for so large an undertaking as an invasion of the
Soviet Union necessarily entailed, even this many months in advance
of the date of execution, certain activity in the East in the
way of construction projects and strengthening of forces. Such
activity could not be expected to pass unnoticed by the Soviet intelligence
service. Counter-intelligence measures were obviously
called for. In an OKW directive signed by Jodl and issued to the
Counter-Intelligence Service Abroad on 6 September 1940, such
measures were ordered (<span class='it'>1229-PS</span>). This directive pointed out
that the activity in the East must not be permitted to create the
impression in the Soviet Union that an offensive was being prepared
and outlined the line for the counter-intelligence people to
take to disguise this fact. The text of the directive indicates, by
necessary implication, the extent of the preparations already underway.
It provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Eastern territory will be manned stronger in the
weeks to come. By the end of October the status shown on
the enclosed map is supposed to be reached.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“These regroupings must not create the impression in Russia
that we are preparing an offensive in the East. On the
other hand, Russia will realize that strong and highly trained
German troops are stationed in the Gouvernement, in the
Eastern provinces, and in the Protekterat; she should draw
the conclusion that we can at any time protect our interests—especially
on the Balkan—with strong forces against Russian
seizure.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For the work of our own intelligence service as well as for
the answer to questions of the Russian intelligence service,
the following directives apply:
<span class='pageno' title='797' id='Page_797'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The respective total strength of the German troops in
the East is to be veiled as far as possible by giving news
about a frequent change of the army units there. This
change is to be explained by movements into training camps,
regroupings.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The impression is to be created that the center of the
massing of troops is in the Southern part of the Gouvernement,
in the Protekterat and in Austria, and that the massing
in the North is relatively unimportant.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. When it comes to the equipment situation of the units,
especially of the armored divisions, things are to be exaggerated,
if necessary.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. By suitable news the impression to be created that the
<span class='it'>antiaircraft protection</span> in the East has been increased considerably
after the end of the campaign in the West and
that it continues to be increased with captured French material
on all important targets.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. Concerning improvements on <span class='it'>railroads</span>, <span class='it'>roads</span>, <span class='it'>airdromes</span>,
<span class='it'>etc.</span>, it is to be stated that the work is kept within normal
limits, is needed for the improvement of the newly won
Eastern territories, and serves primarily economical traffic.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The supreme command of the Army (OKH) decides to
what extent correct details, i.e., numbers of regiments, manning
of garrisons, etc., will be made available to the defense
for purposes of counter espionage.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:1em;'>By order of</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>/signed/&nbsp;&nbsp;Jodl.” (<span class='it'>1229-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Early in November 1940 Hitler reiterated his previous orders
and called for a continuation of preparations, promising further
and more definite instructions as soon as this preliminary work
produced a general outline of the army’s operational plans. This
order was contained in a Top Secret directive from the Fuehrer’s
Headquarters No. 18, dated 12 November 1940, signed by Hitler
and initialed by Jodl (<span class='it'>444-PS</span>). The directive begins by saying
that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The preparatory measures of Supreme Headquarters for
the prosecution of the war in the near future are to be
made along the following lines.” (<span class='it'>444-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It then outlines plans for the various theaters and the policy
regarding relations with other countries and says regarding the
U.S.S.R.:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * 5. <span class='it'>Russia</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Political discussions have been initiated with the aim of
<span class='pageno' title='798' id='Page_798'></span>
clarifying Russia’s attitude for the time being. Irrespective
of the results of these discussions, all preparations for the
East which have already been verbally ordered will be continued.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Instructions on this will follow, as soon as the general
outline of the Army’s operational plans has been submitted
to, and approved by me.” (<span class='it'>444-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 5 December 1940 the Chief of the General Staff of the
Army, at that time General Halder, reported to the Fuehrer
concerning the progress of the plans for the coming operation
against the U.S.S.R. A report of this conference with Hitler is
set forth in a folder containing many documents, all labelled
annexes and all bearing on <span class='it'>Fall Barbarossa</span> (<span class='it'>1799-PS</span>). This
folder was discovered with the War Diary of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht
Fuehrungsstab</span> and was apparently an inclosure to that Diary.
Annex No. 1, dated 5 December 1940, indicates the state which
planning for this aggression had reached six and a half months
before it occurred:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Report to the Fuehrer on 5 December 1940.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Chief of the General Staff of the Army then reports
about the planned operation in the East. He expanded at
first on the geographic fundamentals. The main war industrial
centers are in the Ukraine, in Moscow and in Leningrad.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer declares that he is agreed with the discussed
operational plans and adds the following: The most important
goal is to prevent that the Russians should withdraw
on a closed front. The eastward advance should be combined
until the Russian air force will be unable to attack the territory
of the German Reich and, on the other hand, the German
air force will be enabled to conduct raids to destroy
Russian war industrial territories. In this way we should be
able to achieve the annihilation of the Russian army and to
prevent its regeneration.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The first commitment of the forces should take place in
such a way to make the annihilation of strong enemy units
possible.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is essential that the Russians should not take up positions
in the rear again. The number of 130-140 Divisions as
planned for the entire operation is sufficient.” (<span class='it'>1799-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='799' id='Page_799'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Plan Barbarossa.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>By 18 December 1940 the general outline of the army’s operational
plans having been submitted to Hitler, the basic strategical
directive to the High Commands of the Army, Navy, and Air
Forces for <span class='it'>Barbarossa</span>—Directive No. 21—was issued (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>).
This directive marks the first time the plan to invade the U.S.S.R.
was specifically referred to in an order, although the order was
classified Top Secret. It also marked the first use of the code
word <span class='it'>Barbarossa</span> to denote the operation against the Soviet Union.
One of the most significant passages in that directive is the opening
sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Armed Forces must be prepared to crush Soviet
Russia in a quick campaign even before the end of the war
against England. (Case Barbarossa).” (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The directive continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Preparations requiring more time to start are—if this has
not yet been done—to begin presently and are to be completed
not later than 15 May 1941.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Great caution has to be exercised that the intention of an
attack will not be recognized.” (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The directive then outlined the broad strategy on which the
intended invasion was to proceed and the parts which the Army,
Navy, and Air Forces were to play therein, and called for oral
reports to Hitler by the Commanders-in-Chief. The directive concluded
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“V. I am expecting the reports of the Commanders-in-Chief
on their further plans based on this letter of instructions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The preparations planned by all branches of the Armed
Forces are to be reported to me through the High Command,
also in regard to their time.” (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The directive is signed by Hitler and initialled by Jodl, Keitel,
Warlimont, and one illegible signature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is perfectly clear both from the contents of the order itself
as well as from its history, which has been outlined, that this
directive was no mere staff planning exercise. It was an order
to prepare for an act of aggression which was intended to occur
and which actually did occur. The various services which received
the order understood it as an order to prepare for action
and did not view it as a hypothetical staff problem. This is plain
from the detailed planning and preparation which they immediately
undertook in order to implement the general scheme set
forth in the basic directive.
<span class='pageno' title='800' id='Page_800'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Military Planning and Preparation for the Implementation
of Barbarossa.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Naval War Diary for 30 January 1941 indicates the early
compliance of the OKM with that part of Directive No. 21 (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>)
which ordered progress in preparation to be reported to
Hitler through the High Command of the Armed Forces. This
entry in the War Diary contains a substantial amount of technical
information concerning the Navy’s part in the coming campaign
and the manner in which it was preparing itself to play
that part (<span class='it'>C-35</span>). The following passage shows that the Navy
was actively preparing for the attack at this early date:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>30 January 1941</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>7. Talk by Ia about the plans and preparations for the “Barbarossa”
case to be submitted to the High Command of the
Armed Forces”. (<span class='it'>C-35</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>”Ia” is, in this case, the abbreviation for a deputy head of the
Operations Division of the Naval War Staff.) Then follows a
list of the Navy’s objectives in the war against Russia. Under
the latter, many tasks for the Navy are listed, one of which is
sufficiently typical to give an idea of all:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“II. <span class='it'>Objectives of War Against Russia.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>d.</span> To harass the Russian fleet by surprise blows as:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Lightning-like commitments at the outbreak of the war
of air force units against strong points and combat vessels
in the Baltic, Black Sea, and Ice Sea.” (<span class='it'>C-35</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This document indicates the detailed thinking and planning which
was being carried out to implement <span class='it'>Barbarossa</span> almost six months
before the operation actually got underway. It is but another
piece in the mosaic of evidence which demonstrates beyond question
of doubt that the invasion of the Soviet Union was undeniably
a premeditated attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similarly, the Naval War Diary for the month of February
contains at least several references to the planning and preparation
for the coming campaign (<span class='it'>C-33</span>). The entry for 19 February
1941 is typical:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In regard to the impending operation ‘Barbarossa’ for
which all S-Boats in the Baltic will be needed, a transfer of
some can only be considered after conclusion of the Barbarossa
operations.” (<span class='it'>C-33</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 3 February 1941 the Fuehrer held a conference to assess
the progress thus far made in the planning for <span class='it'>Barbarossa</span>. The
conference also discussed the plans for <span class='it'>Sonnenblume</span>, which was
<span class='pageno' title='801' id='Page_801'></span>
the code name for the North African Operation. Attending this
conference were, in addition to Hitler, the Chief of the Supreme
Command of the Armed Forces, Keitel; the Chief of the Armed
Forces Operations Staff, Jodl; the Commander-in-Chief of the
Army, von Brauchitsch; the Chief of the Army General Staff,
Halder; as well as several others including, Colonel Schmundt,
Hitler’s Adjutant (<span class='it'>872-PS</span>). During the course of this conference,
the Chief of the Army General Staff gave a long report
about enemy strength as compared with German strength, and
about the general overall operational plans for the invasion. This
report was punctuated at various intervals by comments from the
Fuehrer. An extract from this report, although written in a
semishorthand form, is at least sufficiently clear to disclose that
elaborate timetables had already been set up for the deployment
of troops, as well as for industrial operations:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>This much, when read with the conference conclusions, is sufficient
to show that the Army as well as the Navy regarded <span class='it'>Barbarossa</span>
as an action directive and were far along with their preparations
even as early as February 1941—almost five months
prior to 22 June, the date when the attack was actually launched.
The conference report summarized the conclusions of the conference,
insofar as they affected <span class='it'>Barbarossa</span>, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Conclusions</span>:</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As the plans for the invasion became more detailed, involved,
and complete, more and more agencies outside the Armed Forces
had to be brought into the picture, let in on the secret, and assigned
their respective parts. For example, early in March, 1941,
Keitel drafted a letter to be sent to Reich Minister Todt, then
Reich Minister of Armaments and Munitions and head of the organization
Todt. In this letter Keitel explained the principles on
which the camouflage for the operation was based and requested
that the organization Todt follow the same line (<span class='it'>874-PS</span>). This
letter illustrates the elaborate deceit with which the Nazi conspirators
sought to hide the preparations for their treacherous attack:

<p class='pindent'>On 13 March 1941 Keitel signed an operational supplement to
Fuehrer Order #21 (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>), which was issued in the form of
“Directives for Special Areas” (<span class='it'>447-PS</span>). This detailed operational
order, which was issued more than three months in advance
of the attack, indicates how complete were the plans on practically
every phase of the operation. Section I of the directive is
headed “Area of Operations and Executive Power” and outlines
who was to be in control of what and where. It states that while
the campaign is in progress, the Supreme Commander of the
Army has the executive power in territory through which the
army is advancing. During this period, however, the Reichsfuehrer
SS is entrusted with “special tasks.” This assignment
is discussed in paragraph 2b:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * <span class='it'>b.</span> In the area of operations, the <span class='it'>Reichsfuehrer
SS</span> is, on behalf of the Fuehrer, entrusted with <span class='it'>special tasks</span>
for the preparation of the <span class='it'>political administration</span>, tasks
which result from the struggle which has to be carried out
between two opposing political systems. Within the realm
of these tasks, the Reichsfuehrer SS shall act independently
and under his own responsibility. The executive power invested
in the Supreme Commander of the Army (OKH) and
<span class='pageno' title='804' id='Page_804'></span>
in agencies determined by him shall not be affected by this.
It is the responsibility of the Reichsfuehrer SS that through
the execution of his tasks military operations shall not be
disturbed. Details shall be arranged directly through the
OKH with the Reichsfuehrer SS.” (<span class='it'>447-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The order then states that, in time, political administration will
be set up under Commissioners of the Reich. The relationship of
these officials to the army is discussed in paragraphs 2c and 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> As soon as the area of operations has reached sufficient
depth, it is to be <span class='it'>limited in the rear</span>. The newly occupied
territory in the rear of the area of operations is to be given
its own <span class='it'>political</span> administration. For the present, it is to be
divided, according to its genealogic basis and to the positions
of the Army Groups, into <span class='it'>North</span> (<span class='it'>Baltic countries</span>), <span class='it'>Center</span>
(<span class='it'>White Russia</span>) <span class='it'>and South</span> (<span class='it'>Ukraine</span>). In these territories
<span class='it'>the political administration is taken care of by Commissioners
of the Reich</span> who receive their orders from the Fuehrer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. For the execution of all <span class='it'>military tasks</span> within the areas
under political administration in the rear of the area of operations,
<span class='it'>commanding officers</span> who are responsible to the Supreme

command.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The commanding officer is the <span class='it'>supreme representative of
the Armed Forces</span> in the respective areas and the bearer of

or a Commanding General. In this capacity he is
responsible primarily for the following tasks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> Close cooperation with the Commissioner of the Reich
in order to support him in his political task.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> Exploitation of the country and securing its economic
values for use by German industry (see par. 4). (<span class='it'>447-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The directive also outlines the responsibility for the administration
of economy in the conquered territory. This provision
is also contained in Section I, paragraph 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“4. The Fuehrer has entrusted the uniform direction of <span class='it'>the
administration of economy</span> in the area of operations and in
the territories of political administration to the Reich Marshal
who has delegated the Chief of the ‘Wi Rue Amt’ with
the execution of the task. Special orders on that will come
from the OKW/Wi/Rue/Amt.” (<span class='it'>447-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The second section deals with matters of personnel, supply, and
communication traffic. Section III of the order deals with the
<span class='pageno' title='805' id='Page_805'></span>
relations with certain other countries and states, in part, as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“III. <span class='it'>Regulations regarding Rumania, Slovakia, Hungary
and Finland.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>9. The necessary arrangements with these countries shall be

to the wishes of the respective high commands. In
case it should become necessary during the course of the
operations to grant special rights, applications for this purpose
are to be submitted to the OKW.” (<span class='it'>447-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The document closes with a section regarding Sweden:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“IV. <span class='it'>Directives regarding Sweden.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>12. Since Sweden can only become a transient-area for
troops, no special authority is to be granted the commander
of the German troops. However, he is entitled and compelled
to secure the immediate protection of RR-transports
against sabotage and attacks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“signed:&nbsp;&nbsp;KEITEL”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>(<span class='it'>447-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As was hinted in the original Barbarossa Order, Directive No.
21 (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>), the plan originally contemplated that the attack
would take place about the 15th of May 1941. In the meantime,
however, the Nazi conspirators found themselves involved in a
campaign in the Balkans and were forced to delay Barbarossa
for a few weeks. Evidence of this postponement is found in a
document (<span class='it'>C-170</span>) which has been identified by Raeder as a compilation
of official extracts from the Naval War Staff War Diary.
It was prepared by naval archivists who had access to the Admiralty
files and contains file references to the papers which were
the basis for each entry. This item dated 3 April 1941 reads as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Balkan Operations delayed ‘Barbarossa’ at first for about
five weeks.</span> All measures which can be construed as <span class='it'>offensive
actions</span> are to be stopped according to Fuehrer order.”
(<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By the end of April, however, things were sufficiently straightened
out to permit the Fuehrer definitely to set D-Day as 22
June—more than seven weeks away. A “Top Secret” report of
a conference with the Chief of the Section <span class='it'>Landsverteidigung</span> of
the <span class='it'>Wehrmachtfuhrungsstab</span> on 30 April 1941 states, in the first
two paragraphs:
<span class='pageno' title='806' id='Page_806'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. <span class='it'>Timetable Barbarossa</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>The Fuehrer has decided:</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Action Barbarossa</span> begins on 22 June. From 23 May maximal
troop movements performance schedule. At the beginning
of operations the OKH reserves will have not yet
reached the appointed areas.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. <span class='it'>Proportion of actual strength in the plan Barbarossa:
Sector North</span>: German and Russian forces approximately of
the same strength.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Sector Middle</span>: Great German superiority.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Sector South</span>: Russian superiority.” (<span class='it'>873-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Early in June, approximately three weeks before D-Day, preparations
for the attack were so complete that it was possible for
the High Command to issue an elaborate timetable showing in
great detail the disposition and missions of the Army, Navy, and
Air Force. This timetable (<span class='it'>C-39</span>) was prepared in 21 copies.
The copy reproduced here was the third copy, which was given
to the High Command of the Navy. Page 1 is in the form of a

<p class='noindent'>The document then proceeds to outline the state of preparations
as of 1 June 1941. The outline is in six paragraphs covering the
status on that date under six headings: General; Negotiations
with Friendly States; Army; Navy; Air Force, and Camouflage.
The remainder of the document is in tabular form with six
<span class='pageno' title='807' id='Page_807'></span>
columns headed from left to right at the top of each page—Date;
Serial No.; Army; Navy; OKW; Remarks. The item appearing
under date 21 June and Serial No. 29, provides in the columns
for Army, Navy, and Air Forces that, “Till 1300 hours latest time
at which operation can be cancelled (<span class='it'>spaetester Anhaltetermin</span>)”
(<span class='it'>C-39</span>). Under the column headed OKW appears the note: “Cancelled
by code word ‘Altona’ or further confirmation of start of
attack by code word: ‘Dortmund’ ” (<span class='it'>C-39</span>). In the Remarks
column appears the statement that: “Complete absence of camouflage
of formation of Army point of main effort (<span class='it'>Schwerpunkt</span>),
concentration of armour and artillery must be reckoned with”
(<span class='it'>C-39</span>). The entry for 22 June, under serial number 31, gives
a notation which cuts across the columns for the Army, Air
Force, Navy, and OKW and provides as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>There is attached a list of participants and the order in which
they will report. The list includes a large number of the members
of the High Command and General Staff Group as of that
date. Among those to participate were Goering, Keitel, Jodl,
and Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foregoing documents are sufficient to establish the premeditation
and calculation which marked the military preparations
for the invasion of the U.S.S.R. Starting almost a full year
before the launching of the attack, the Nazi conspirators planned
and prepared every military detail of their aggression against
the Soviet Union with all that thoroughness and meticulousness
which has come to be associated with the German character. The
leading roles were performed in this preparation by the military
figures—Goering, Keitel, Jodl, and Raeder.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>Plans for the Economic Exploitation and Spoliation of the
U.S.S.R.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Not only was there detailed preparation for the invasion from
a purely military standpoint, but equally elaborate and detailed
planning was undertaken by the Nazi conspirators to insure that
their aggression would prove economically profitable. The motives
which led the conspirators to plan and launch attack
were both political and economic. The economic basis may be
simply summarized as the greed of the Nazi conspirators for the
raw material, food, and other supplies which their neighbor possessed
and which they conceived of themselves as needing for
the maintenance of their war machine. To the Nazi conspirators
a need was translated as a right, and they early began planning
<span class='pageno' title='809' id='Page_809'></span>
and preparing with typical care and detail to insure that every
bit of the plunder which it would be possible to reap in the
course of their aggression would be exploited to their utmost
benefit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As early as August 1940 General Thomas, Chief of the <span class='it'>Wi Rue
Amt</span>, received a hint from Goering about a possible attack on
the U.S.S.R., which prompted him to begin considering the Soviet
war economy. In November 1940—8 months before the attack—Thomas
was categorically informed by Goering of the planned
operation in the East, and preliminary preparations were commenced
for the economic plundering of the territories to be
occupied in the course of such operation (<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>). Goering
played the overall leading role in this activity by virtue of his
position at the head of the Four Year Plan. Thomas describes his
receipt of the knowledge and this early planning in these terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * In November, 1940, the Chief of the <span class='it'>Wi Rue</span> together
with Secretaries of state Koerner, Neumann, Backe
and General von Hanneken were informed by the Reichmarshal
of the action planned in the East.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“By reason of these directives the preliminary preparations
for the action in the East were commenced by the office
of Wi Rue at the end of 1940.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The preliminary preparations for the action in the East
included first of all the following tasks:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Obtaining of a detailed survey of the Russian Armament
industry, its location, its capacity and its associate
industries.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Investigation of the capacity of the different big armament
centers and their dependency one on the other.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Determine the power and transport system for the industry
of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. Investigation of sources of raw materials and petroleum
(crude oil).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. Preparation of a survey of industries other than armament
industries in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“These points were concentrated in one big compilation ‘War
Economy of the Soviet Union’ and illustrated with detailed
maps, etc.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Furthermore a card index was made, containing all the
important factories in Soviet-Russia, and a lexicon of economy

<p class='noindent'>“For the processing of these problems a task staff, Russia,
<span class='pageno' title='810' id='Page_810'></span>
was created, first in charge of Lieutenant Colonel Luther and
later on in charge of Brigadier General Schubert. The
work was carried out according to the directives from the
Chief of the Office, resp. the group of depts. for foreign territories
(Ausland) with the cooperation of all departments,
economy offices and any other persons, possessing information
on Russia. Through these intensive preparative activities
an excellent collection of material was made, which
proved of the utmost value later on for carrying out the
operations and for administering the territory.” (<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By the end of February 1941 this preliminary planning had
proceeded to a point where a broader plan of organization was
needed. General Thomas held a conference, with his subordinates
on 28 February 1941 to call for such a plan. A memorandum
of this conference classified Top Secret and dated 1
March 1941, reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The general ordered that a broader plan of organization
be drafted for the Reich Marshal.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Essential Points:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The whole organization to be subordinate to the Reich
Marshal. <span class='it'>Purpose</span>: Support and extension of the measures
of the four-year plan.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The organization must include everything concerning
war economy, excepting only food, which is said to be made
already a special mission of State Secretary Backe.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Clear statement that <span class='it'>the organization is to be independent
of the military or civil administration</span>. Close cooperation,
but instructions direct from the central office in
Berlin.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. Scope of activities to be divided in two steps:</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>a.</span> Accompanying the advancing troops directly behind the
front lines, in order to avoid the destruction of supplies and
to secure the removal of important goods.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>b.</span> Administration of the occupied industrial districts and
exploitation of economically complimentary districts.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. In view of the extended field of activity, the term <span class='it'>war
economy</span> inspection is to be used preferably, instead of armament
inspection.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“6. In view of the great field of activity, the organization
must be generously equipped and personnel must be correspondingly
numerous. <span class='it'>The main mission of the organization</span>
will consist of <span class='it'>seizing raw materials and taking over all</span>
<span class='pageno' title='811' id='Page_811'></span>
<span class='it'>important concerns</span>. For the latter mission reliable persons
from German concerns will be interposed suitably from the
beginning, since successful operation from the beginning can
only be performed by the aid of their experiences, (for
example, lignite, ore, chemistry, petroleum).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“After the discussion of further details, Lt. Col. Luther was
instructed to make an initial draft of such an organization
within one week.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Close cooperation with the individual sections in the building
is essential. An officer must still be appointed for Wi
and Rue, with whom the operational staff can remain in constant
contact. Wi is to give each section chief and Lt. Col.
Luther a copy of the new plan regarding Russia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Major General Schubert is to be asked to be in Berlin the
second half of next week. Also, the four officers who are
ordered to draw up the individual armament inspections are
to report to the Office Chief at the end of next week.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>(<span class='it'>1317-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hamann, who signed the report is listed among those attending
as a Captain, was apparently the junior officer present. Presumably
it fell naturally to his lot to prepare the minutes of the
meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The authority and mission of this organization which Thomas
was organizing at the direction of Goering was clearly recognized
by Keitel in his operational order of 13 March 1941
(<span class='it'>447-PS</span>). The order stated that the Fuehrer had entrusted the
uniform direction of the administration of economy in the area
of operations and political administration to the Reichsmarshal
(Goering) who in turn had delegated his authority to the Chief
of the <span class='it'>Wi Rue Amt</span> (Thomas). (<span class='it'>447-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The organizational work called for by General Thomas at the
meeting on 28 February apparently proceeded apace, and on
29 April 1941 a conference was held with various branches of
the Armed Forces to explain the organizational set-up of Economic
Staff <span class='it'>Oldenburg</span>. (<span class='it'>Oldenburg</span> was the code name given to this
economic counterpart of <span class='it'>Barbarossa</span>.) Section I of the report
of this conference (<span class='it'>1157-PS</span>) deals with the general organization
of Economic Staff <span class='it'>Oldenburg</span> as it had developed. The report
begins:

<p class='noindent'>“As already known, the Fuehrer, contrary to previous procedure,
has ordered for this drive the uniform concentration
in one hand of <span class='it'>all</span> economic operations and has entrusted
the Reich Marshal with the overall direction of the
economic administration in the area of operations and in
the areas under political administration.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Marshal has delegated this function to an economic
general staff, working under the director of the industrial
armament office (<span class='it'>Chef Wi Rue Amt</span>).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Under the Reich Marshal and the economic general staff,
the supreme central authority in the area of the drive itself
is the <span class='it'>Economic Staff Oldenburg for special duties</span> under
the command of Major General (Generalleutnant) Schubert.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“His subordinate authorities, geographically subdivided are:</p>
<div class='blockquote-right97percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>5</span><p class='listPara'>economic inspectorates</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>23</span><p class='listPara'>economic commands</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>12</span><p class='listPara'>sub-offices, which are distributed among important
   places within the area of the economic commands.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“These offices are used in the <span class='it'>military rear area</span>; the idea is
that in the territory of each Army Group an economic inspectorate
is to be established at the seat of the commander
of the military rear area, and that this inspectorate will
supervise the economic exploitation of the territory.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A distinction must be made between the military rear area
on the one hand and the battle area proper and the rear area
of the army on the other hand. In the last economic matters
are dealt with by the IV Econ (IV Wi) of the Army Headquarters
Commands, i.e. the liaison officer of the industrial
armament office within the supreme command of the armed
forces at the army headquarters commands. For the battle
area he has attached to him: technical battalions, reconnaissance
and recovery troops for raw materials, mineral oil,
agricultural machinery, in particular tractors and means of
production.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the territory between the battle and the military rear
area, the rear area of the Army, group IV Econs at the
various field commands are placed at the disposal of the
<span class='pageno' title='813' id='Page_813'></span>
liaison officer of the industrial armaments office in order
to support the army headquarters commands specialists responsible
for supplying the troops from the country’s resources
and for preparing the subsequent general economic
exploitation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“While these units move with the troops, economic inspectorates,
economic commands and their sub-offices remain
established in the locality.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The new feature inherent in the organization under the
command of the Economic Staff <span class='it'>Oldenburg</span> is that it does
not only deal with military industry, but comprises the <span class='it'>entire</span>
economic field. Consequently, all offices are no longer
to be designated as offices of the military industries or
armaments, but quite generally as economic inspectorates,
economic commands, etc.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This also corresponds with the internal organization of
the individual offices which, from the Economic Staff <span class='it'>Oldenburg</span>
down to the economic commands, requires a standard
subdivision into three large groups, i.e.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Group H</span> dealing with troop requirements, armaments, industrial
transport organization.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Group L</span> which concerns itself with all questions of feed
and agriculture, and</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Group W</span> which is in charge of the entire field of trade and
industry, including raw materials and suppliers; further
questions of forestry, finance and banking, enemy property,
commerce and exchange of commodities and manpower allocation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Secretary of State Backe is appointed Commissioner for
Food and Agriculture in the General Staff; the problems
falling within the field of activities of Group W are dealt
with by General v. Hanneken.” (<span class='it'>1157-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of the document deals with local subdivisions,
personnel and staffing problems, and similar details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These documents portray the calculated method with which the
Nazi conspirators prepared months in advance to rob and loot
their intended victim. They show that the conspirators not only
planned to stage an attack on a neighbor they had pledged to
security, but that they also intended to strip that neighbor of its
food, its factories, and all its means of livelihood. The Nazi
conspirators made these plans for plunder being fully aware that
to carry them out would necessarily involve ruin and starvation
for millions of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union. (The story
<span class='pageno' title='814' id='Page_814'></span>
of how this plot was executed forms a part of the case to be presented
by the Soviet prosecuting staff.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>E. <span class='it'>Preparation for the Political Phase of the Aggression.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As has already been indicated, and as will be later more fully
developed, there were both economic and political motives for the
action of the Nazi conspirators in invading the Soviet Union.
The economic aspects have been discussed. Equally elaborate
planning was engaged in by the Nazi conspirators to insure the
effectuation of the political aim of their aggression. That political
aim may be described as the elimination of the U.S.S.R. as
a powerful political factor in Europe, and the acquisition of
<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>. For the accomplishment of these purposes the Nazi
conspirators selected as their agent Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As early as 2 April 1941 Rosenberg, or a member of his staff,
prepared a memorandum on the U.S.S.R. (<span class='it'>1017-PS</span>). This memorandum
speculates on the possibility of a disagreement with the
U.S.S.R. which would result in a quick occupation of an important
part of that country. The memorandum then considers
what the political goal of such occupation should be and suggests
ways for reaching such a goal. This memorandum begins:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Subject: The U.S.S.R.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Bolshevik Russia, just as the one-time Czarist Russia, is a
conglomeration of peoples of very different types, which has
come into being through the annexation of states of a related
or even of an essentially alien character.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A military conflict with the U.S.S.R. will result in an extraordinarily
rapid occupation of an important and large
section of the U.S.S.R. It is very probable that military
action on our part will very soon be followed by the military
collapse of the U.S.S.R. The occupation of these areas
would then present not so many military as administrative
and economic difficulties. Thus arises the first question:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Is the occupation to be determined by purely military and/or
economic needs, or is the laying of political foundations for
a future organization of the area also a factor in determining
how far the occupation shall be extended? If so, it is
a matter of urgency to fix the <span class='it'>political</span> goal which is to be attained,
for it will, without doubt, also have an effect on
military operations.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If the Political overthrow of the Eastern Empire, in the
weak condition it would be at the time, is set as the goal
of military operations, one may conclude that:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The occupation must comprise areas of vast proportions;
<span class='pageno' title='815' id='Page_815'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. From the very beginning, the treatment of individual
sections of territory should, as regards administration, as
well as economics and ideology, be adapted to the political
ends we are striving to attain;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Again, extraordinary questions concerning these vast
areas, such as, in particular, the ensuring of essential supplies
for the continuation of the war against England, the
maintenance of production which this necessitates and the
great directives for the completely separate areas, should
best be dealt with all together in one place.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It should again be stressed here that, in addition, all the
arguments which follow of course only hold good once the
supplies from the area to be occupied which are essential
to Greater Germany for the continuance of the war, have
been assured.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Anyone who knows the East, sees in a map of Russia’s
population the following national or geographical units:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> Greater Russia with Moscow as its centre.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> White Russia with Minsk or Smolensk as its capital.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>d.</span> The Ukraine and the Crimea with Kiev as its centre.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>e.</span> The Don area with Rostov as its capital.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>f.</span> The area of the Caucasus.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>g.</span> Russian Central Asia or Russian Turkestan.” (<span class='it'>1017-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The memorandum then proceeds to discuss each of the areas or
geographical units thus listed in some detail. At the end of the
paper the writer sums up his thoughts and briefly outlines his
plan in these terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Summary</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The following systematic constructional plan is evolved
from the points briefly outlined here:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The creation of a central department for the occupied
areas of the U.S.S.R., to be confined more or less to wartime.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Working in agreement with the higher and supreme Reich
authorities, it would be the task of this department—</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> To issue binding political instructions to the separate
administration area, having in mind the situation existing
at the time and the goal which is to be achieved.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> To secure for the Reich supplies essential to the war
from all the occupied areas.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> To make preparations for, and to supervise the carrying
out, in main outline, of the primarily important questions
for all areas, as for instance, those of finance and
<span class='pageno' title='816' id='Page_816'></span>
funds, transport, and the production of oil, coal and food;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The carrying out of sharply defined decentralization in
the separate administration area, grouped together by
race or by reason of political economy, for the carrying out
of the totally dissimilar tasks assigned to them.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As against this, an administrative department, regulating
matters in principle, and to be set up on a purely economic
basis, as is at present envisaged, might very soon prove to
be inadequate, and fail in its purpose. Such a central office
would be compelled to carry out a common policy for all
areas, dictated only by economic considerations, and this
might impede the carrying out of the political task and, in
view of its being run on purely bureaucratic lines, might
possibly even prevent it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The question therefore arises, whether the opinions which
have been set forth should not, purely for reasons of expediency,
be taken into consideration from the very beginning
when organizing the administration of the territory on
a basis of war economy. In view of the vast spaces and the
difficulties of administration which arise from that alone,
and also in view of the living conditions created by Bolshevism,
which are totally different from those of Western
Europe, the whole question of the U.S.S.R. would require
different treatment from that which has been applied in the
individual countries of Western Europe.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2.4.41” (<span class='it'>1017-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is evident that the “presently envisaged” administration
operating on a purely economic basis, to which this memorandum
objects, was the Economic Staff <span class='it'>Oldenburg</span> which was set up
under Goering and Thomas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg’s statement of the political purpose of the invasion
and his analysis of methods for achieving it apparently did not
fall on deaf ears. By a Fuehrer Order dated 20 April 1941 he
was named “Commissioner for the Central Control of Questions
Connected with the East-European Region”. This order is part
of a correspondence file regarding Rosenberg’s appointment
(<span class='it'>865-PS</span>). Hitler’s order reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I name Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg as my Commissioner
for the central control of questions connected with the East-European
Region.</p>

orders, is at the disposal of Reichsleiter Rosenberg for the

<p class='pindent'>Immediately upon receipt of the order from Hitler, Rosenberg
began building his organization, conferring with the various ministries,
issuing his instructions, and generally making the detailed
plans and preparations necessary to carry out his assigned mission.
Although Rosenberg’s files, which were captured intact,
were crowded with documents evidencing both the extent of the
preparation and its purpose, the citation of a small number which
are typical should be sufficient. All the documents now discussed
were found in Rosenberg’s files.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a memorandum dated 8 May 1941, entitled “General Instructions
for all Reichcommissars in the occupied Eastern Territories”,
Rosenberg gives instructions to his chief henchmen and
outlines clearly the political aims and purposes of the attack. In
the second two paragraphs of the English translation the following
remarks appear:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The only possible political goal of war can be the aim to
free the German Reich from the Great Russian (<span class='it'>gross-russisch</span>)
pressure for centuries to come. This does not only
correspond with German interests, but also with historical
justice, for Russian Imperialism was in a position to accomplish
its policy of conquest and oppression almost unopposed,
whilst it threatened Germany again and again. Therefore, the
German Reich has to beware of starting a campaign against
<span class='pageno' title='820' id='Page_820'></span>
Russia with a historical injustice, meaning the reconstruction
of a Great Russian Empire, no matter of what kind. On the
contrary, all historical struggles of the various nationalities
against Moscow and Petersburg have to be scrutinized for
their bearing on the situation today. This has been done on
the part of the National Socialist movement to correspond to
the Leader’s political testament as laid down in his book, that
now the military and political threat, from the East shall be
eliminated forever.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore this huge area must be divided according to its
historical and racial conditions into Reichs-Commissariats,
each of which bears within itself a different political aim.
The Reich Commissariat Eastland (<span class='it'>Ostland</span>) including White Ruthenia
will have the task, to prepare, by way of development
into a Germanized Protectorate, a progressively closer
cohesion with Germany. The Ukraine shall become an independent
state in alliance with Germany and Caucasia with
the contiguous Northern Territories a Federal State with a
German plenipotentiary. Russia proper must put her own
house in order for the future. These general viewpoints are
explained in the following instructions for each Reich Commissar.
Beyond that there are still a few general considerations
which possess validity for all Reich Commissars.”
(<span class='it'>1030-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The fifth paragraph presents an interesting rationalization of
a contemplated robbery:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German people has achieved, in the course of centuries,
tremendous accomplishments in the Eastern European area.
Nearly its entire real estate property was confiscated without
indemnification, hundreds of thousands (in the South, on the
Volga) starved or were deported or, like in the Baltic territories,
were cheated out of the fruits of their cultural work
during the past 700 years. The German Reich will now have
to proclaim the principle, that after the occupation of the
Eastern Territories, the former German assets have become
property of the people of Greater Germany, irrespective of
the consent of the former individual proprietors where the
German Reich may reserve the right (assuming that it has
not already been done during resettlement) to arrange a just
settlement. The manner of compensation and restitution of
this national property, will be subject to different treatment
by each Reich Commissariat.” (<span class='it'>1030-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“An Instruction for a Reich Commissar in the Baltic Countries
<span class='pageno' title='821' id='Page_821'></span>
and White Russia” (<span class='it'>1029-PS</span>) is typical of the directives issued
to each of the appointed commissioners. This order is amazingly
frank in outlining the intentions of the Nazi conspirators toward
the country they intended to occupy in the course of their aggression.
It begins:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“All the regions between Narva and Tilsit have, constantly
been in close relationship with the German people. A 700
year old history has moulded the inner sympathies of the
majority of the races living there in a European direction,
and has added this region to the living space of Greater Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The aim of a Reich Commissar for Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania
and White Russia [last words added in pencil] must be
to strive to achieve the form of a German Protectorate, and
then transform the region into part of the Greater German
Reich by germanizing racially possible elements, colonizing
Germanic races and banishing undesirable elements. The
Baltic Sea must become a Germanic inland sea under the
guardianship of Greater Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For certain cattle-raising products, the Baltic region was a
land of surplus, and the Reich Commissar must endeavor to
make this surplus once more available to the German people,
and, if possible, to increase it. With regard to the process
of germanizing or resettling, the Esthonian people are
strongly germanized to the extent of 50% by Danish, German
and Swedish blood and can be considered as a kindred
nation. In Latvia, the section capable of being assimilated
is considerably smaller than in Esthonia. In this country
stronger resistance will have to be reckoned with and banishment
on a larger scale will have to be envisaged. A similar
development may have to be reckoned with in Lithuania, for
here too the emigration of racial Germans is called for in order
to promote very intensive Germanization (on the East
Prussian border).”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The task of a Reich Commissar with his seat of office in
Riga will therefore largely be an extraordinarily positive
one. A country which 700 years ago was captured by German
Knights built up by the Hanseatic League, and by reason
of a constant influx of German blood, together with
Swedish elements, was a predominantly Germanized land, is
to be established as a mighty, German borderland. The preliminary
cultural conditions are available everywhere, and
the German Reich will be able to guarantee the right to a
<span class='pageno' title='822' id='Page_822'></span>
later emigration to all those who have distinguished themselves
in this war, to the descendants of those who gave their
lives during the war, and also to all who fought in the Baltic
campaign never once lost courage, fought on in the hour of
despair and delivered Baltic civilization from Bolshevism.
For the rest, the solution of the colonization problem is not
a Baltic question, but one which concerns Greater Germany,
and it must be settled on these lines.” (<span class='it'>1029-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These two directives are sufficiently typical of the lot to show
the extent of the planning and preparation for this phase of the
aggression as well as the political purpose it was hoped would be
achieved thereby. They are reinforced by a later report of Rosenberg’s.
On 28 June 1941, less than a week after the invasion,
Rosenberg himself prepared a full report of his activities since
his appointment on the 20th of April (<span class='it'>1039-PS</span>). This report
makes disclosures concerning the number of conspirators who
worked with and assisted Rosenberg in the planning and preparation
for this phase of the aggression and the extent to which
practically all the ministries and offices of both the State and the
Party were involved in this operation. The report was found in
Rosenberg’s files and, although it is rather long, it is of sufficient
importance in implicating persons, groups and organizations to
justify quotation in full:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Report on the Preparatory Work in Eastern European
Questions</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Immediately after the notification of individual Supreme
Reich offices regarding the Fuehrer’s decree of 20.4.1941 a
conference with the Chief of the OKW [Armed Forces High
Command] took place. After presentation of the various
political aims in the proposed Reichskommissariats and presentation
of personal requirements for the East, the Chief
of the OKW explained that a deferment (<span class='it'>OK-stellung</span>) would
be too complicated in this case and that this matter could be
carried out best by direct cancellation (<span class='it'>Abkommandierung</span>)
by command of the Chief of the OKW. Generalfeldmarschall
Keitel then issued an appropriate command which established
the basis for the coming requirements. He named as
deputy and liaison officer General Jodl and Maj. Gen. Warlimont.
The negotiations which then commenced relative in all
questions of the Eastern Territory were carried on by the
gentlemen of the OKW in collaboration with officials of my
office.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A conference took place with Admiral Canaris to the effect
that under the given confidential circumstances my office
<span class='pageno' title='823' id='Page_823'></span>
could in no way deal with any representatives of people of
the East-European area. I asked him to do this insofar
as the Military intelligence required it, and then to name
persons to me who could count as political personalities over
and above the military intelligence in order to arrange for
their eventual commitment later. Admiral Canaris said
that naturally also my wish not to recognize any political
groups among the emigrants would be considered by him
and that he was planning to proceed in accordance with my
indications.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Later on I informed Generalfeldmarschall von Brauchitsch
and Grossadmiral Raeder about the historical and political
conceptions of the Eastern problem. In further conferences
we agreed to appoint a representative of my office to the
Supreme Commander of the Army, respectively to the chief
quartermaster and to the army groups for questions relative
to political configuration and requests of the OKW. In
the meantime this has been done.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Already at the outset there was a discussion with Minister
of Economy (<span class='it'>Reichswirtschaftsminister</span>) Funk, who appointed
as his permanent deputy Ministerialdirektor Dr.
Schlotterer. Almost daily conferences were then held with
Dr. Schlotterer with reference to the war-economic intentions
of the Economic Operational Staff (<span class='it'>Wirtschaftsfuehrungsstab</span>)
East. In this connection I had conferences
with General Thomas, State Secretary (<span class='it'>Staatssekretaer</span>)
Koerner, State Secretary Backe, Ministerial Director Riecke,
General Schubert and others. Far-reaching agreement was
reached in the eastern questions as regards direct technical
work now and in the future. A few problems regarding
the relationship of the proposed Reich ministry toward the
four-year plan are still open and will be subject, after submission,
to a decision of the Fuehrer. In principle I declared
that I am in no way intended to found an economic
department in my office, economics would rather be handled
substantially and practically by the Reichsmarschall and
the persons appointed by him, however the two responsible
department heads, namely Ministerial Director Dr. Schlotterer
for industrial economics and Ministerial Director
Riecke for food economies, would be placed in my office as
permanent liaison men, to coordinate here political aims
with the economic necessities, in a department which would
have to unite yet other persons for such coordinating work,
depending on later and for work (political leadership of
<span class='pageno' title='824' id='Page_824'></span>
labor unions, construction etc.). After notification of the
Reich foreign minister, the latter appointed Geheimrat
Grosskopf as permanent liaison man to my office. For the
requested representation in the political department of my
office (headed by Reichsamtsleiter Dr. Leibbrandt) the
foreign ministry released General Counsel Dr. Braeutigam,
who is known to me for many years, speaks Russian, and
worked for years in Russia. Negotiations which if necessary
will be placed before the Fuehrer are under way with
the foreign office regarding its wishes for the assignment of
its representatives to the future Reich commissioners.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The propaganda ministry appointed State Secretary Gutterer
as permanent liaison man, and a complete agreement
was reached to the effect that the decisions on all political
and other essays, speeches, proclamations, etc. would be
made in my office; a great number of substantial works for
propaganda would be delivered and the papers prepared by
the propaganda ministry would be modified here if necessary.
The whole practical employment of propaganda will
undisputedly be subject to the Reich ministry of public enlightenment
and propaganda. For the sake of closer cooperation
the propaganda ministry assigns yet another person
directly to my department ‘Enlightenment and Press’
(<span class='it'>Aufklaerung und Presse</span>) and in addition appoints a permanent
press liaison man. All these activities have been
going on for some time, and without attracting attention to
my office in any way, this agreement on contents and terminology
takes place continually every day.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Thorough discussions took place with Reichsminister
Ohnesorge concerning future transmission of communication
and setting up of all technical necessities in future occupied
territories; with Reichsminister Seldte on the supply
of labor forces, with Reichsminister Frick (State
Secretary Stuckart) in detailed form on the assignment of
numerous necessary officials for the commissariats. According
to the present estimate there will be four Reichs Kommissariats,
as approved by the Fuehrer. I shall propose to
the Fuehrer for political and other reasons to set up a
suitable number of General Commissariats (24) Main Commissariats
(about 80) and Regional (<span class='it'>Gebiet</span>) Commissariats
(over 900). A General Commissariat would correspond to
a former Generalgovernment, a Main Commissariat to a
Maingovernment. A Regional Commissariat contains 3 or 4
Districts (<span class='it'>Kreise</span>). In view of the huge spaces that is the
<span class='pageno' title='825' id='Page_825'></span>
minimum number which appears necessary for a future civil
government and/or administration. A portion of the officials
has already been requested on the basis of the above-named
command of the Chief of the OKW.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the same manner conferences have taken place with the
Reich Physicians Leader (<span class='it'>Reichsaerztefuehrer</span>) Dr. Conti,
the Inspector of the Army Veterinary Service, and all specialists
belonging thereto. The difficulties of medical and
veterinary supply were thoroughly discussed and the measures
were previewed, in order to insure well-prepared employment
of the forces mentioned after the end of the
operations. A conference with Reichsminister Dr. Todt resulted
in the assignment first of all of 4 higher leaders of
the Construction Service, whereupon Dr. Todt proposed to
unite administratively under one leadership the whole Construction
Service.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Discussions took place with Reich Leader Amann and his
chief of staff Rienhardt regarding the publication of four
German newspapers in the Reich Commissariats to start
with. Furthermore a number of newspapers in the prospective
native tongues were considered. According to the latest
information the technical forces, for this work are already
at the border and may be committed at any time to determine
whether the prerequisites for printing shops are
present.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Discussions are also under way with Corpsleader (<span class='it'>Korpsfuehrer</span>)
Huehnlein and with the Reich youth leadership to
assure a necessary and suitable mobilization. Intensive
talks also took place with the Chief of Staff (<span class='it'>Stabschef</span>)
of the SA. He was asked to make available a number of the
most reliable SA leaders for this gigantic territory, which
he agreed to do. The personnel suggestions together with
other suggestions will be submitted to the Fuehrer. The
same agreement has been reached with the Reich organizational
leader (<span class='it'>Reichsorganisationsleiter</span>), who has instructed
the commander of Kroessinsee, Gohdes, to carry out the
swelling channelling of requested persons, to admit them
into Kroessinsee for schooling and instruction on the whole
problem and prepare them in the best manner for commitment.
On the orders of Dr. Ley party member Marrenbach
was then employed in order to take over already now the
leadership of Russian labor unions in connection with the
Wehrmacht. That appeared as an eminently important
problem, particularly also in connection with the economic
<span class='pageno' title='826' id='Page_826'></span>
leadership, because the labor unions undoubtedly have been
a powerful support of the Soviets and especially have the
commitment of the German Labor Front appeared necessary
under certain conditions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Lengthy discussions regarding the relationship of the Police
to the new order in the East have taken place. Certain
proposed changes thereto have been suggested by the Reichsfuehrer
SS and on his order by Gruppenfuehrer [SS Lt Gen]
Heydrich which do not appear supportable to me for the
complete authority of the German Reich government in the
East. Also the documents of this problem will have to be
laid before the Fuehrer for decision.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Aside from these negotiations I received the responsible
deputies of the entire propaganda, namely Ministerial Director
Fritsche, Ambassador Schmidt, Reich Superintendent
of Broadcasting Glasmeier, Dr. Grothe OKW, and others.
Without going into details of political objectives I instructed
the above-named persons in confidence about the necessary
attitude, with the request to tone down the whole terminology
of the press, without issuing any statements.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The works for substantial coverage of the Eastern question
prepared long ago appeared in my office, which I turned
over to the propaganda deputies. I enclose a few samples
thereof. These pamphlets, which may later be turned over
to the press for development, deal with the whole structure
and organization of the USSR, the economic possibilities
of the East, Agriculture, the peoples of the Soviet Union,
the work of the Komintern since 1889, the Jews in the Soviet
Union since 1933, statistical results of the poll taken among
the Germans in Russia, the history of the Ukraine, of the
Caucasus, of Turkestan. Extensive works are in preparation
for the foundation of legal administration: German law in
the Ukraine, German art in the Ukraine, influence of the
German language on the Ukrainian language, the Ukrainians
from the viewpoint of the Germans. In addition a number
of articles are being prepared in Russian language which
have the purpose of enlightening the people of the Soviet
Union about true conditions in Germany. These articles are
also suitable as the basis for newspaper articles in the newly
occupied territories. Finally, after extensive work, an
ethnological map of the East based on the most recent statistical
reports has been printed in great number and made
available to all offices. This map can be used as the basis
of eventual fixing of boundaries in the north as well as in
<span class='pageno' title='827' id='Page_827'></span>
the south, and offers points of departure for fixing the
boundaries of the future Reich Commissariats.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As a result of these conferences, conducted for the most
part by myself, continuous consultation and organizational
preparation is under way through my office and through
those of the liaison men delegated from the other offices of
the Party and the State. I may say that all the work,
inasmuch as it is at all possible under present condition, is
in full swing. Aside from the General and Chief commissariats
more than 900 Regional Commissariats are planned,
which must all be manned by political leaders, representatives
of the department and officials of the Reich Ministry
of the Interior. The work in the East differs basically from
the conditions in the West. Whereas we can count on every
technical installation and a cultured population here in the
big cities, that is not the case in the East. There literally
everything will have to be prepared and taken along, additionally
for the gigantic spaces—not only an auto park but
a great number of typewriters, office material, above all
medical supplies and much more down to the bed sheets. It
does not appear possible to accomplish such a project suddenly
in 14 days, therefore all these arrangements had to be
set in full motion already now on my responsibility on the
basis of the Fuehrer’s decree.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The structure of my office itself is temporarily organized
as follows in carrying out the Fuehrer’s order. I have requested
Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter Dr. Meyer as my
permanent representative. He has negotiated personally
and thoroughly, through the whole time with all pertinent
offices, in order to develop all aspects down to the details.
A political department has been founded for the execution
of the substantial work, under my co-worker of many years
Dr. Leibbrandt (deputy General Consul Dr. Braeutigam),
who prepares the various books and pamphlets for information.
A great number of propaganda leaflets have been
composed by him which will then have been scattered over
the Russian front in huge numbers by the armed forces.
Also for a specific time other leaflets are ready which are
addressed directly to the individual races. I do not care to
decide on this date for myself, and will lay these originals
before the Fuehrer at the first opportunity with the request
to check the contents and determine the time of the eventually
approved appeals. The political department is also
undertaking a thorough investigation of all those, with the
<span class='pageno' title='828' id='Page_828'></span>
exception of Russians, who eventually can be used as advisors
for the administration of the various nationalities.
Continuous discussions about this subject are under way
with representatives of the OKW, the propaganda ministry,
etc. Secondly a department of economic—political cooperation
has been founded under direction of Oberbereichsleiter
Malletke. A department of ‘Law, Finance, and Administration’
has been taken over by Regierungspraesident Runte.
A department for Culture and Science is as yet unoccupied
since the development of this question does not appear urgent.
Also the department ‘Enlightenment and Press’. It
is occupied by Major of the Air Force Carl Cranz, deputy
Job Zimmermann. Integrated here are co-workers who
command the Russian, Ukrainian, and other languages. The
wishes of the Reich Press Chief (<span class='it'>Reichspressechef</span>) for setting
up one press chief for each Reichskommissar are under
discussion in order to decide them in that sense if possible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Thus I hope that when, after preliminary conclusion of the
military action the Fuehrer has the possibility for a report
from me, I shall be able to report to the Fuehrer far-reaching
preparations, up to those points of special and personal
nature which the Fuehrer alone can decide.” (<span class='it'>1039-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(As a part of the case to be presented by the Soviet prosecuting
staff, it will be shown how all this planning and preparation
for the elimination of the U.S.S.R. as a political factor were actually
carried out. The planned execution of intelligentsia, and
other Russian leaders was, for example, but a part of the actual
operation of the program to destroy the Soviet Union politically
and make impossible its early resurrection as a European Power.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having thus elaborately prepared on every side for the invasion
of the Soviet Union, the Nazi conspirators proceeded to carry
out their plans and on 22 June 1941 hurled their armies across
the borders of the U.S.S.R. In announcing this act of perfidy to
the world, Hitler issued a proclamation on the day of the attack,
which declared: “I have therefore today decided to give the fate
of Europe again into the hands of our soldiers.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>This announcement told the world that the die had been cast;
that the plans darkly conceived almost a full year before and secretly
and continuously developed since then, had now been
brought to fruition. The Nazi conspirators, having carefully and
completely planned and prepared this war of aggression, now
proceeded to initiate and wage it.
<span class='pageno' title='829' id='Page_829'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>F. <span class='it'>The Motives for the Attack.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It should first be pointed out that not only was Germany bound
by solemn covenant not to attack the U.S.S.R., but throughout the
entire period from August 1939 to the invasion in 1941, the Soviet
Union was faithful to its agreements with Germany and displayed
no aggressive intentions toward the territories of the German
Reich. General Thomas, for example, points out in his draft of
“Basic Facts for a History of the German War and Armaments
Economy” (<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>), that insofar as the German-Soviet trade
agreement of 11 August 1939 was concerned, the Soviets carried
out their deliveries thereunder up to the very end. Thomas points
out that deliveries by the Soviets were usually made quickly and
well, and since the food and raw material being thus delivered
was considered essential to the German economy, efforts were
made to keep up their side too. However, as preparations for the
campaign proceeded, the Nazis cared less about maintaining their
obligations. At page 315 of his book Thomas says:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Later on the urgency of the Russian deliveries diminished,
as preparations for the campaign in the East were already
under way.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Russians carried out their deliveries as planned, right
up to the start of the attack; even during the last few days,
transports of India-rubber from the Far East were completed
by Express transit trains.” (<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Again at page 404, Thomas brings this point out even more forcefully:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In addition to the Italian negotiations, until June, 1941, the
negotiations with Russia were accorded a great deal of attention.
The Fuehrer issued the directive that, in order to
camouflage German troop movements, the orders Russia has
placed in Germany must be filled as promptly as possible.
Since the Russians only made grain deliveries, when the Germans
delivered orders placed by the Russians, and since in
the case of individual firms these deliveries to Russia made
it impossible for them to fill orders for the German armed
forces, it was necessary for the Wi Rue office to enter into
numerous individual negotiations with German firms in order
to coordinate Russian orders with those of the German
from the standpoint of priority. In accordance with the
wishes of the Foreign Office, German industry was instructed
to accept all Russian orders, even if it were impossible to fill
them within the limits of the time set for manufacture and
delivery. Since in May especially, large deliveries had to be
made to the Navy, the firms were instructed to allow the
<span class='pageno' title='830' id='Page_830'></span>
equipment to go through the Russian Acceptance Commission,
then, however, to make such a detour during its transportation
as to make it impossible for it to be delivered over
the frontier prior to the beginning of the German attack.”
(<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Not only was the Soviet Union faithful to its treaty obligations
with Germany, but she had no aggressive intentions toward German
territory. A file on Russo-German relations found in the
files of the Naval High Command, covering the entire period from
the treaty to the attack (<span class='it'>C-170</span>), demonstrates this point conclusively.
It will be sufficient to quote a few entries, which include
reports from the German ambassador in Moscow as late as
June 1941. Entry 165 reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“165 A 22.29 4 June</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Outwardly, no change in the relationship Germany-Russia.
Russian deliveries continue to full satisfaction. Russian government
is endeavoring to do everything to prevent a conflict
with Germany.” (<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Entry 167 reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“167 A 22.53 6 June</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Ambassador in Moscow reports * * * Russia will only
fight if attacked by Germany. Situation is considered in
Moscow much more serious than up to now. All military
preparations have been made quietly—as far as can be recognized
only defensive. Russian policy still strives as before
to produce the best possible relationship to Germany as
good.” (<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Entry 169 also reiterates this point:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“169 A 22.65 7 June</p>

<p class='noindent'>“From the report of the Ambassador in Moscow * * *.
All observations show that Stalin and Molotov, who alone
are responsible for Russian foreign policy, are doing everything
to avoid a conflict with Germany. The entire behavior
of the Government, as well as the attitude of the press, which
reports all events concerning Germany in a factual, indisputable
manner, support this view. The loyal fulfillment of
the economic treaty with Germany proves the same thing.”
(<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The reasons, therefore, which led to the attack on the Soviet
Union could not have been self-defense or treaty breaches. No
doubt, as has been necessarily implied from the materials presented
on planning and preparation, more than one motive entered
into the decision of the Nazi conspirators to launch their
aggression against the U.S.S.R. All of them, however, appear to
<span class='pageno' title='831' id='Page_831'></span>
blend into one grand motif of Nazi policy. The pattern into which
these varied reasons fall is the traditional Nazi ambition for expansion
to the East at the expense of the U.S.S.R. This Nazi
version of an earlier imperial imperative, “<span class='it'>Drang Nach Osten</span>,”
had been a cardinal principle of the Party almost since its
birth, and rested on the twin bases of political strategy and economic
aggrandizement. Politically, such action meant elimination
of the powerful force to the East, which might constitute a
threat to German ambition, and acquisition of <span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>. Economically,
it offered opportunities for the plunder of vast quantities
of food, raw materials, and other supplies. Undoubtedly
the demands of the German War economy for food and raw material
served to revive the attractiveness of the economic side of
this theory while the difficulties Germany was experiencing in
defeating England reaffirmed for the Nazi conspirators the temporarily
forgotten Nazi political imperative of eliminating, as a
political factor, their one formidable opponent on the continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As early as 1923 Hitler outlined this theory in some detail in
<span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, where he stated, at page 641 of the Houghton Mifflin
English edition:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“There are two reasons which induce me to submit to a special
examination the relation of Germany to Russia:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Here perhaps we are dealing with the most decisive concern
of all German foreign affairs; and</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. This question is also the touchstone for the political capacity
of the young National Socialist movement to think
clearly and to act correctly.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Again, at page 654 of the same edition:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“And so we National Socialists consciously draw a line beneath
the foreign policy tendency of our pre-war period. We
take up where we broke off six hundred years ago. We stop
the endless German movement to the south and west, and
turn our gaze toward the land in the east. At long last we
break off the colonial and commercial policy of the pre-war
period and shift to the soil policy of the future.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If we speak of soil in Europe today, we can primarily have
in mind only Russia and her vassal border states.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The political portion of this dichotomy of purpose is clearly reflected
in the stated purposes, previously discussed, of the organization
which Rosenberg set up to administer the occupied
Eastern Territories. In a speech which Rosenberg delivered, two
days before the attack, to the people most interested in the problem
of the East, he restated in his usual somewhat mystic fashion
the political basis for the campaign and its interrelationship with
<span class='pageno' title='832' id='Page_832'></span>
the economic goal (<span class='it'>1058-PS</span>). A short extract from that speech
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The job of feeding the German people stands, this year,
without a doubt, at the top of the list of Germany’s claims on
the East; and here the southern territories and the northern
Caucasus will have to serve as a balance for the feeding
of the German people. We see absolutely no reason for any
obligation on our part to feed also the Russian people with
the products of that surplus territory. We know that this is
a harsh necessity, bare of any feelings. A very extensive
evacuation will be necessary, without any doubt, and it is
sure that the future will hold very hard years in store for the
Russians. A later decision will have to determine to which
extent industries can still be maintained there (Wagon Factories,
etc.). The consideration and execution of this policy
in the Russian area proper is for the German Reich and its
future a tremendous and by no means negative task, as
might appear, if one takes only the harsh necessity of the
evacuation into consideration. The conversion of Russian
dynamics towards the East is a task which requires the
strongest characters. Perhaps, this decision will also be approved
by a coming Russia later, not in 30 but maybe in a
100 years. For the Russian soul has been torn in the struggle
of the last 200 years. The original Russians are excellent
artistic craftsmen, dancers and musicians. They have certain
hereditary talents, but these talents are different from these
of the Western people. The fight between Turgenjew and
Dostejewsky was symbolic for the nation. The Russian soul
found no outlet, either way. If we now close the West to the
Russians, they might become conscious of their own inborn,
proper forces and of the area to which they belong. An
historian will maybe see this decision in a different light, in
hundreds of years than it might appear to a Russian today.”
(<span class='it'>1058-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As has been indicated, the failure of the Nazi conspirators to
defeat Britain had served further to strengthen them in their belief
in the political necessity of eliminating the Soviet Union as a
European factor before Germany could completely achieve her
role as the master of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The economic motive for the aggression was disclosed in the
previous discussion of the organization set up under Goering and
General Thomas to carry out the economic exploitation of the territory
to be occupied. The purely materialistic basis for the attack
was unmistakable. If any doubt existed that at least one of
<span class='pageno' title='833' id='Page_833'></span>
the main purposes of the invasion was to steal the food and raw
material needed for the Nazi war machine, regardless of the consequences
to the Russian people which such robbery would entail,
that doubt is dispelled by a memorandum showing clear and
conscious recognition by the Nazis that their plans would no
doubt result in starving to death millions of people. (<span class='it'>2718-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 20 June 1941 General Thomas wrote a memorandum along
a similar line, in which he stated that Keitel had confirmed to him
Hitler’s present conception of the German economic policy concerning
raw materials (<span class='it'>1456-PS</span>). This policy expressed the
theory that less manpower would be used in the conquest of
sources of raw materials than would be necessary to produce synthetics
in lieu of such raw materials. This memorandum reads,
in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The following is the new conception of the Fuehrer, which
Minister Todt has explained to me and which has been confirmed
later on by Field Marshal Keitel:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The course of the war shows that we went too far in our
autarchical endeavors. It is impossible to try and manufacture
everything we lack, by synthetic procedures, or other
measures. For instance, it is impossible to develop our motor
fuel economy to a point where we can entirely depend on it.
All these autarchical endeavors ask for a tremendous amount
of manpower, and it is simply impossible to provide it. One
has to choose another way. What one does not have, but
needs, one must conquer. The commitment of men which is
necessary one single time, will not be as great as the one
that is currently needed for the running of the synthetic factories
in question. The aim must also be to secure all territories,
which are of special interest to us for the war economy,
by conquering them.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At the time the 4-year-plan was established, I issued the
statement where I made it clear that a completely autarchical
economy is impossible for us, because the need of men will
be too great. Nevertheless, my solution was always to provide
the necessary reserves for missing stocks respectively
to secure the delivery in wartime through economic alliances.”
(<span class='it'>1456-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On this macabre note the story of this aggression comes to
an end. In view of the solemn pledge of nonaggression; the
base and sinister motives involved; the months of secret planning
and preparation; and the suffering intentionally and deliberately
wrought; it may perhaps not be too much to say that in the
history of relations between sovereign nations, a blacker chapter
<span class='pageno' title='834' id='Page_834'></span>
has never been written than the one which tells of the Nazi
conspirators’ unprovoked invasion of the territory of the Soviet
Union.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg840a'>13. COLLABORATION WITH ITALY AND JAPAN AND<br/> AGGRESSIVE WAR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES:<br/> NOVEMBER 1936 TO DECEMBER 1941</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of two years, the swastika had been carried forward
by force of arms from a tightly controlled and remilitarized
Germany to the four corners of Europe. The conspirators then
projected the Nazi plan upon a universal screen, involving the
old World of Asia and the New World of the United States of
America. As a result, the wars of aggression that were planned
in Berlin and launched across the frontiers of Poland ended some
six years later, almost to the day, in surrender ceremonies aboard
a United States battleship riding at anchor in the Bay of Tokyo.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Formal German—Japanese—Italian Alliances.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The first formal alliance between Hitler’s Germany and the
Japanese Government was the Anti-Comintern Pact signed in
Berlin on 25 November 1936 (<span class='it'>2508-PS</span>). This agreement, on its
face, was directed against the activities of the Communist International.
It was subsequently adhered to by Italy on 6 November
1937 (<span class='it'>2506-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is an interesting fact—especially in light of the evidence to
be presented regarding Ribbentrop’s active participation in collaboration
with the Japanese—that Ribbentrop signed the Anti-Comintern
Pact for Germany, at Berlin, even though at that time,
November 1936, Ribbentrop was not the German Foreign Minister,
but simply Hitler’s Special Ambassador Plenipotentiary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 27 September 1940, some four years after the Anti-Comintern
Pact was signed and one year after the initiation of war in
Europe, the German, Italian, and Japanese Governments signed
another pact at Berlin—a ten-year military-economic alliance
(<span class='it'>2643-PS</span>). Again Ribbentrop signed for Germany, this time in
his capacity as Foreign Minister: This Tripartite Pact pledged
<span class='pageno' title='841' id='Page_841'></span>
Germany, Italy, and Japan to support of, and collaboration with
each other in the establishment of a “new order” in Europe and
East Asia. The agreement stated, in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan consider
it as a condition precedent of a lasting peace, that each nation
of the world be given its own proper place. They have therefore
decided to stand together and to cooperate with one another
in their efforts in Greater East Asia and in the regions
of Europe, wherein it is their prime purpose to establish
and maintain a new order of things calculated to promote
the prosperity and welfare of the peoples there. Furthermore,
it is the desire of the three Governments to extend this
cooperation to such nations in other parts of the world as
are inclined to give to their endeavors a direction similar
to their own, in order that their aspirations towards world
peace as the ultimate goal may thus be realized. Accordingly,
the Governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan have
agreed as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 1: Japan recognizes and respects the leadership of
Germany and Italy in the establishment of a new order in
Europe.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 2: Germany and Italy recognize and respect the
leadership of Japan in the establishment of a new order in
Greater East Asia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 3: Germany, Italy, and Japan agree to cooperate in
their efforts on the aforesaid basis. They further undertake
to assist one another with all political, economic and military
means, if one of the three Contracting Parties is attacked
by a Power at present not involved in the European
war or in the Chinese-Japanese conflict.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 6: The present Pact shall come into force immediately
upon signature and shall remain in force for ten years
from the date of its coming into force.” (<span class='it'>2643-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tripartite Pact of 27 September 1940 thus was a bold announcement
to the world that the leaders of Germany, Japan, and
Italy had cemented a full military alliance to achieve world domination
and to establish the “new order” presaged by the Japanese
invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Italian conquest of Ethiopia
in 1935, and the Nazi overflow into Austria early in 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A statement by Cordell Hull, Secretary of State of the United
States at the time of the signing of the Tripartite Pact, is relevant
in this connection. Mr. Hull declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The reported agreement of alliance does not, in the view of
<span class='pageno' title='842' id='Page_842'></span>
the Government of the United States, substantially alter a
situation which has existed for several years. Announcement
of the alliance merely makes clear to all a relationship
which has long existed in effect and to which this Government
has repeatedly called attention. That such an agreement
has been in process of conclusion has been well known
for some time, and that fact has been fully taken into account
by the Government of United States in the determining
of this country’s policies.” (<span class='it'>2944-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>No attempt is made here to trace the relationships and negotiations
leading up to the Tripartite Pact of 27 November 1940.
Nevertheless, one example of the type of German-Japanese relationship
existing before the formalization of the Tripartite Pact
is noteworthy—the record of a conversation of 31 January 1939
between Himmler and General Oshima, Japanese Ambassador at
Berlin. This record, which is signed by Himmler in crayon, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>File Memorandum</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Today I visited General Oshima. The conversation ranged
over the following subjects:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The Fuehrer speech, which pleased him very much, especially
because it had been spiritually warranted in all its
features.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. We discussed conclusion of a treaty to consolidate the
triangle Germany/Italy/Japan into an even firmer mold. He
also told me that, together with German counter-espionage
(<span class='it'>Abwehr</span>), he was undertaking long-range projects aimed at
the disintegration of Russia and emanating from the Caucasus
and the Ukraine. However, this organization was to
become effective only in case of war.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Furthermore he had succeeded up to now to send 10 Russians
with bombs across the Caucasian frontier. These Russians
had the mission to kill Stalin. A number of additional
Russians, whom he had also sent across, had been shot at
the frontier.” (<span class='it'>2195-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Nazi Encouragement of Aggression by Japan</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators, once their military and economic alliance
with Japan had been formalized, exhorted the Japanese to
aggression against those nations with whom they were at war
and against those with whom they contemplated war. In this
the Nazi conspirators pursued a course strikingly parallel to that
followed in their relationship with the other member of the European
Axis. On 10 June 1940, in fulfillment of her alliance with
Germany, Italy had carried out her “stab in the back” by declaring
<span class='pageno' title='843' id='Page_843'></span>
war against France and Great Britain. The Nazi conspirators
set about to induce similar action by Japan on the other side
of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nations against whom the German-Japanese collaboration
was aimed, at various times, were the British Commonwealth of
Nations, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the United
States of America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Exhortations to Attack the British Commonwealth.</span> At
least as early as 23 February 1941 the Nazi conspirators undertook
to exploit their alliance with Japan by exhortations to commit aggression
against the British Commonwealth. Again the figure of
Ribbentrop appears. On that date, 23 February 1941, he held a
conference with General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to
Berlin, at which he urged that the Japanese open hostilities
against the British in the Far East as soon as possible. (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As can be seen on the cover page of the English translation of
the report of that conference, Ribbentrop on 2 March sent copies
of an extract of the record of this conference to his various ambassadors
and ministers for their “strictly confidential and purely
personal information,” with the further note that “these statements
are of fundamental significance for orientation in the general
political situation facing Germany in early Spring 1941.”
The report stated, in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“Strictly secret</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“Extract</p>

<p class='noindent'>“from the report of the conference of the Reich Foreign
Minister with Ambassador Oshima in Fuschl on 13 February
1941.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“After particularly cordial mutual greetings, the RAM [Reich
Foreign Minister] declared that Ambassador Oshima had
been proved right in the policy he had pursued regarding
Germany in the face of the many doubters in Japan. By
Germany’s victory in the west these policies had been fully
vindicated. He [the RAM] regretted that the alliance between
Germany and Japan, for which he had been working
with the Ambassador for many years already, had come into
being only after various detours, but public opinion in Japan
had not been ripe for it earlier. The main thing was, however,
that they are together now.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Now the <span class='it'>German-Japanese alliance</span> has been concluded.
Ambassador Oshima is the man who gets credit for
it from the Japanese side. After conclusion of the alliance
<span class='pageno' title='844' id='Page_844'></span>
the question of its further <span class='it'>development</span> now stands in the
foreground. How is the situation in this respect? (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop subsequently proceeded to shape the argument for
Japanese intervention against the British. First outlining the intended
air and U-boat warfare against England, he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Thereby England’s situation would take catastrophic
shape overnight. The landing in England is prepared;
its execution, however, depends on various factors,
above all on weather conditions.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer would beat England wherever he would encounter
her. Besides our strength is not only equal, but superior
to a combined English-American air force at any time.
The number of pilots at our disposal was unlimited. The
same was true for our airplane production capacity. As far
as quality is concerned ours was always superior to the English
(to say nothing about the American) and we were on the
way even to enlarge this lead. On order of the Fuehrer the
antiaircraft defense too would be greatly reinforced. Since
the army had been supplied far beyond its requirements, and
enormous reserves had been piled up (the ammunitions plants
have been slowed down because of the immense stock of material),
production would now be concentrated on submarines,
airplanes and antiaircraft guns.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Every eventuality had been provided for; the war has been
won today militarily, economically and politically. We had
the desire to end the war quickly and to force England to
sue for peace soon. The Fuehrer was vigorous and healthy,
fully convinced of victory and determined to bring the war
to a quick and victorious end. To this end the cooperation
with Japan was of importance. However, Japan in its own
interest, should come in as soon as possible. This would
destroy England’s key position in the Far East. Japan, on
the other hand, would thus secure its position in the Far East,
a position which it could acquire only through war. There
were three reasons for quick action:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Intervention by Japan would mean a decisive blow
against the center of the British Empire (threat to India,
cruiser-warfare, etc.) The effect upon the morale of the
British people would be very serious and this would contribute
toward a quick ending of the war.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. A surprising intervention by Japan was bound to keep
America out of the war. America, which at present is not
<span class='pageno' title='845' id='Page_845'></span>
armed as yet and would hesitate greatly to expose her Navy
to any risks West of Hawaii, could do this even less so in
such a case. If Japan would otherwise respect the American
interests, there would not even be the possibility for Roosevelt
to use the argument of lost prestige to make war plausible
to the Americans. It was very unlikely that America
would declare war if it then would have to stand by helplessly
while Japan takes the Philippines without America being able
to do anything about it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. In view of the coming new world order it seems to be in
the interest of Japan also to secure for herself already during
the war the position she wants to hold in the Far East
at the time of a peace treaty. Ambassador Oshima agreed
with me entirely and said that he would do everything to
carry through this policy.” (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The subtlety of Ribbentrop’s argument is noteworthy. First
he told the Japanese Ambassador that Germany had already
practically won the war by herself. Nevertheless, he suggested
that the war could be successfully terminated more quickly with
Japan’s aid and that the moment was propitious for Japan’s
entry. Then, referring to the spoils of conquest, he indicated
that Japan would be best advised to pick up by herself during
the war the positions she wanted, implying that she would have
to earn her share of the booty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of Ribbentrop’s argument shows something
of the real nature of the German-Japanese alliance:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Foreign Minister continued by saying that it
was Japan’s friendship which had enabled Germany to arm
after the Anti-Comintern Pact was concluded. On the other
hand, Japan had been able to penetrate deeply into the
English sphere of interest in China. Germany’s victory on
the continent has brought now, after the conclusion of the
Three Power Pact, great advantages for Japan. France,
as a power, was eliminated in the Far East (Indo-China).
England too was considerably weakened; Japan had been
able to close in steadily on Singapore. Thus, Germany had
already contributed enormously to the shaping of the future
fate of the two nations. Due to our geographical situation
we should have to carry the main burden of the final battle
in the future, too. If an unwanted conflict with Russia
should arise we should have to carry the main burden also
in this case. If Germany should ever weaken Japan would
find itself confronted by a world-coalition within a short
time. We were all in the same boat. The fate of both
<span class='pageno' title='846' id='Page_846'></span>
nations was being determined now for centuries to come.
The same was true for Italy. The interests of the three
countries would never intersect. A defeat of Germany
would also mean the end of the Japanese imperialistic idea.
“Ambassador Oshima definitely agreed with these statements
and emphasized the fact that Japan was determined
to keep its imperial position. The Reich Foreign Minister
then discussed the great problems which would arise after
the war for the parties of the Three Power Pact from the
shaping of a new order in Europe and East Asia. The
problems arising then would require a bold solution. Thereby
no overcentralization should take place, but a solution
should be found on a basis of parity, particularly in the
economic realm. In regard to this the Reich Foreign Minister
advanced the principle that a free exchange of trade
should take place between the two spheres of interest on a
liberal basis. The European-African hemisphere under the
leadership of Germany and Italy, and the East-Asian sphere
of interest under the leadership of Japan. As he conceived
it, for example, Japan would conduct trade and make trade
agreements directly with the independent states in the
European hemisphere, as heretofore, while Germany and
Italy would trade directly and make trade agreements with
the independent countries within the Japanese orbit of
power, such as China, Thailand, Indochina, etc. Furthermore,
as between the two economic spheres, each should
fundamentally grant the other preferences with regard to
third parties. The Ambassador expressed agreement with
this thought.” (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The instigation to war by Ribbentrop, the German Foreign
Minister, is clear. The participation of the German military
representatives in the encouragement and provocation of wars
of aggression is shown in a Top Secret order signed by Keitel
as Chief of the OKW and entitled “Basic Order No. 24 Regarding
Collaboration with Japan” (<span class='it'>C-75</span>). It is dated 5 March
1941, about a week and a half after Ribbentrop’s conference with
Oshima, just discussed. It was distributed in 14 copies to the
highest commands of the Army, Navy, and Air Force as well as
to the Foreign Office. Two copies of this order, identical except
for handwritten notations presumably made by the recipients,
were turned up by the prosecution. Document <span class='it'>C-75</span> is Copy
No. 2 of the order, distributed to the Naval War Staff of the
Commander-in-Chief of the Navy (the OKM). Copy No. 4, designed
for the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht Fuehrungsstab</span>—the Operations Staff
<span class='pageno' title='847' id='Page_847'></span>
of the High Command of the Armed Forces—was found in the
OKW files at Flensburg. The head of this Operations Staff was
Jodl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Basic Order No. 24 was the authoritative Nazi policy on collaboration
with Japan (<span class='it'>C-75</span>). It reads:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer has issued the following order regarding collaboration
with Japan:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. It must be the <span class='it'>aim</span> of the collaboration based on the
Three Power Pact to induce Japan as soon as possible <span class='it'>to take
active measures in the Far East</span>. Strong British forces will
thereby be tied down, and the center of gravity of the interests
of the United States of America will be diverted to
the Pacific.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The sooner it intervenes, the greater will be the prospects
of success for Japan in view of the still undeveloped preparedness
for war on the part of its adversaries. The “Barbarossa”
operation will create particularly favorable political
and military prerequisites for this. [Marginal note—“slightly
exaggerated”]</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. <span class='it'>To prepare the way</span> for the collaboration it is essential
to strengthen the <span class='it'>Japanese military potential</span> with all means
available.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For this purpose the High Commands of the branches of
the Armed Forces will comply in a comprehensive and generous
manner with Japanese desires for information regarding
German war and combat experience and for assistance in
military economics and in technical matters. Reciprocity is
desirable but this factor should not stand in the way of negotiations.
Priority should naturally be given to those Japanese
requests which would have the most immediate application
in waging war.
<span class='pageno' title='848' id='Page_848'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“In special cases the Fuehrer reserves the decisions to himself.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The <span class='it'>harmonizing of the operational plans of the two parties</span>
is the responsibility of the Navy High Command.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This will be subject to the following guiding principles:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> The <span class='it'>common aim</span> of the conduct of war is to be stressed
as forcing England to the ground quickly and thereby keeping
the United States out of the war. Beyond this Germany
has no political, military, or economic interests in the Far
East which would give occasion for any reservations with regard
to Japanese intentions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> The great successes achieved by Germany in <span class='it'>mercantile
warfare</span> make it appear particularly suitable to employ strong
Japanese forces for the same purpose. In this connection
every opportunity to support German mercantile warfare
must be exploited.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> The <span class='it'>raw material situation</span> of the <span class='it'>pact powers</span> demands
that Japan should acquire possession of those territories
which it needs for the continuation of the war, especially if
the United States intervenes. Rubber shipments must be
carried out even after the entry of Japan into the war, since
they are of vital importance to Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>d.</span> The <span class='it'>seizure of Singapore</span> as the key British position in
the Far East would mean a decisive success for the entire
conduct of war of the Three Powers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In addition, attacks on other systems of bases of British
naval power—extending to those of American naval power
only if the entry of the United States into the war cannot be
prevented—will result in weakening the enemy’s system of
power in that region and also, just like the attack on sea
communications, in tying down substantial forces of all kinds
(Australia).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A date for the beginning of operational discussions cannot
yet be fixed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. In the <span class='it'>military commissions</span> to be formed in accordance
with the <span class='it'>Three Power Pact</span>, only such questions are to be
dealt with as equally concern the <span class='it'>three</span> participating powers.
These will include primarily the problems of <span class='it'>economic warfare</span>.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The working out of the details is the responsibility of the
“Main Commission” with the cooperation of the Armed
Forces High Command.
<span class='pageno' title='849' id='Page_849'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. The Japanese must not be given any intimation of the
Barbarossa operation.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It appears from this document that the Nazi conspirators’ cardinal
operational principle in their collaboration with Japan was,
as early as March 1941, the inducement of Japan to aggression
against Singapore and other British Far Eastern bases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A meeting was held on 18 March 1941, about two weeks after
the issuance of Basic Order No. 24 (<span class='it'>C-75</span>) and was attended by
Hitler, Raeder, Keitel, and Jodl. The top secret record of this
meeting discloses that Raeder, then Commander in Chief of the
Navy, made the following calculations:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Japan must take steps to seize Singapore as soon as possible,
since the opportunity will never again be as favourable
(whole English Fleet contained; unpreparedness of U. S. A.
for war against Japan; inferiority of U. S. Fleet vis-à-vis
the Japanese). Japan is indeed making preparations for this
action, but according to all declarations made by Japanese
officers she will only carry it out if Germany proceeds to
land in England. Germany must therefore concentrate all
her efforts on spurring Japan to act immediately. If Japan
has Singapore all other East Asiatic questions regarding the
U. S. A. and England are thereby solved (Guam, Philippines,
Borneo, Dutch East Indies).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Japan wishes if possible to avoid war against U. S. A. She
can do so if she determinedly takes Singapore as soon as
possible.” (<span class='it'>C-152</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The fact clearly appears from these minutes that military staff
conferences had already been held with the Japanese to discuss
the activation of Japanese military support against the British
and to urge their immediate attack on Singapore. Another passage
in the record of this meeting establishes this:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Japan is indeed making preparations for this action, but
according to all declarations made by Japanese officers she
will only carry it out if Germany proceeds to land in England.”
(<span class='it'>C-152</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Apparently the Nazis were subsequently able to persuade the
Japanese to eliminate this condition precedent to their performance
under the contract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Ribbentrop continued to make further efforts to
<span class='pageno' title='850' id='Page_850'></span>
induce the Japanese to aggression against the British Commonwealth.
On 29 March 1941, he met with the Japanese Foreign
Minister Matsuoka, who was then in Berlin. The following is a report
of their conversations, found in the German Foreign Office
Archives:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“REPORT ON THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE REICH MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (RAM) AND THE JAPANESE FOREIGN MINISTER MATSUOKA IN BERLIN ON 29 MARCH 1941.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The RAM resumed the preceding conversation with Matsuoka
about the latter’s impending talks with the Russians
in Moscow, where they had left off. He expressed the opinion,
that it would probably be best, in view of the whole situation,
not to carry the discussions with the Russians too far.
He did not know how the situation would develop. One
thing, however, was certain, namely, that Germany would
strike immediately, should Russia ever attack Japan. He
was ready to give Matsuoka this positive assurance, so that
Japan could push forward to the South on Singapore, without
fear of possible complications with Russia. The largest
part of the German army was anyway on the Eastern frontiers
of the Reich, and fully prepared to open the attack at
any time. He (the RAM), however, believed that Russia
would try to avoid development leading to war. Should Germany
however enter into a conflict with Russia, the USSR
would be finished off within a few months. In this case,
Japan had of course even less reason to be afraid than ever,
if it wants to advance on Singapore. Consequently, it need
not refrain from such an undertaking because of possible
fears of Russia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“He could not know of course, just how things with Russia
would develop. It was uncertain whether or not Stalin would
intensify his present unfriendly policy against Germany. He
(the RAM) wanted to point out to Matsuoka, in any case,
that a conflict with Russia was anyhow within the realm of
possibility. In any case, Matsuoka could not report to the
Japanese Emperor upon his return, that a conflict between
Russia and Germany was impossible. On the contrary, the
situation was such, that such a conflict, even if it were not
probable, would have to be considered possible.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Next, the RAM turned again to the Singapore question. In
view of the fears expressed by the Japanese of possible attacks
by submarines, based on the Philippines, and of the
<span class='pageno' title='851' id='Page_851'></span>
intervention of the British Mediterranean and Home fleets,
he had again discussed the situation with General-Admiral
Raeder. The latter had stated that the British Navy during
this year would have its hands so full in the English home
waters and in the Mediterranean, that it would not be able
to send even a single ship to the Far East. General-Admiral
Raeder had described the U. S. submarines as so bad that
Japan need not bother about them at all.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Matsuoka replied immediately that the Japanese Navy had
a very low estimate of the threat from the British Navy; it
also held the view that, in case of a clash with the American
Navy, it would be able to smash the latter without trouble.
However it was afraid that the Americans would not take up
the battle with their fleet; thus the conflict with the United
States might perhaps be dragged out to five years. This
possibility caused considerable worry in Japan.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The RAM replied that America could not do anything
against Japan in the case of the capture of Singapore. Perhaps
for this reason alone, Roosevelt would think twice before
deciding on active measures against Japan. For while
on one hand he could not achieve anything against Japan,
on the other hand there was the probability of losing the
Philippines to Japan; for the American president, of course,
this would mean a considerable loss of prestige, and because
of the inadequate rearmament, he would have nothing to offset
such a loss.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In this connection, Matsuoka pointed out, that he was doing
everything to reassure the English about Singapore. He
acted as if Japan had no intention at all regarding this key
position of England in the East. Therefore it might be
possible that his attitude toward the British would appear
to be friendly in words and in acts. However, Germany
should not be deceived by that. He assumed this attitude
not only in order to reassure the British, but also in order to
fool the pro-British and pro-American elements so long, until
one day he would suddenly open the attack on Singapore.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In this connection, Matsuoka stated that his tactics were
based on the certain assumption that the sudden attack
against Singapore would unite the entire Japanese nation
with one blow. (“Nothing succeeds like success,” the RAM
remarked.) He followed here the example of the words of a
famous Japanese statesman, addressed to the Japanese Navy
at the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war: “You open fire,
then the nation will be united.” The Japanese need to be
<span class='pageno' title='852' id='Page_852'></span>
shaken up to awaken. After all, as an Oriental, he believed
in fate, which would come, whether you wanted it or not.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Matsuoka then introduced the subject of German assistance
in the blow against Singapore, a subject which had been
broached to him frequently, and mentioned the proposal of
a German written promise of assistance.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The RAM replied that he had already discussed these questions
with Ambassador Oshima. He had asked him to procure
maps of Singapore in order that the Fuehrer—who
probably must be considered the greatest expert on military
questions at the present time—could advise Japan on the
best method of attack against Singapore. German experts
on aerial warfare, too, would be at her disposal; they could
draw up a report, based on their European experiences, for
the Japanese on the use of divebombers from airfields in
the vicinity against the British fleet in Singapore. Thus the
British fleet would be forced to disappear from Singapore
immediately.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Matsuoka remarked that Japan was less concerned with the
British fleet, than with the capture of the fortifications.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The RAM replied that here, too, the Fuehrer had developed
new methods for the German attacks on strongly fortified
positions, such as the Maginot Line and Fort Eben-Emael,
which he could make available to the Japanese.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Matsuoka replied in this connection that some of the
younger, expert Japanese naval officers, who were close
friends of his, were of the opinion that the Japanese naval
forces would need three months until they could capture
Singapore. As a cautious Foreign Minister, he had doubled
this estimate. He believed he could stave off any danger
which threatened from America, for six months. If, however,
the capture of Singapore required still more time and
if the operations would perhaps even drag out for a year,
the situation with America would become extremely critical
and he did not know as yet how to meet it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If at all avoidable, he would not touch the Netherland East
Indies, since he was afraid that in case of a Japanese attack
on this area, the oilfields would be set afire. They could be
brought into operation again only after 1 or 2 years.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The RAM added that Japan would gain decisive influence
over the Netherland East Indies simultaneously with the
capture of Singapore.” (<span class='it'>1877-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 5 April, about a week after the conference just noted, Ribbentrop
<span class='pageno' title='853' id='Page_853'></span>
again met with Matsuoka and again pushed the Japanese
another step along the road to aggressive war. The notes
of this conference, which were also found in German Foreign
Office Archives, reveal the following exchange:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * In answer to a remark by Matsuoka, that Japan
was now awakening and, according to the Japanese temperament,
would take action quickly after the previous lengthy
deliberation, the Reich Foreign Minister replied that it was
necessary, of course, to accept a certain risk in this connection,
just as the Fuehrer had done so successfully with the
occupation of the Rhineland, with the proclamation of sovereignty
of armament, and with the resignation from the
League of Nations.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Foreign Minister replied that the new German
Reich would actually be built up on the basis of the ancient
traditions of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation,
which in its time was the only dominant power on the
European Continent.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In conclusion the Reich Foreign Minister once again summarized
the points he wanted Matsuoka to take back to
Japan with him from his trip:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Germany had already won the war. With the end of
this year the world would realize this. Even England would
have to concede it, if it had not collapsed before then, and
America would also have to resign herself to this fact.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. There were no conflicting interests between Japan and
Germany. The future of both countries could be regulated
for the long run on the basis that Japan should predominate
in the Far East, Italy and Germany in Europe and Africa.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Whatever might happen, Germany would win the war.
But it would hasten victory if Japan would enter the war.
Such an entry into the war was undoubtedly more in the
interest of Japan than in that of Germany, for it offered a
unique opportunity which would hardly ever return, for the
fulfillment of the national objectives of Japan, a chance
which would make it possible for her to play a really leading
role in East Asia.” (<span class='it'>1882-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here again, in the portions just quoted, Ribbentrop is seen
pursuing the same tack previously noted: Germany has already
won the war for all practical purposes. Japan’s entry will
hasten the inevitable end. <span class='it'>And</span> Japan had better get the positions
she wants <span class='it'>during</span> the war. Ribbentrop’s assurances, (<span class='it'>1877-PS</span>)
that Japan likewise had nothing to fear from the Soviet Union
<span class='pageno' title='854' id='Page_854'></span>
if Japan entered the conflict, and his continual references to the
weakness of the United States scattered throughout his conversations,
were other means used to hurry along the Japanese.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The success of the Nazi methods is shown in a top secret report,
dated 24 May 1941, from the German Military Attache in
Tokyo to the Intelligence Division of the OKW. The last sentence
in paragraph 1, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The preparations for attack on Singapore and Manila
stand.” (<span class='it'>1538-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The fact appears from this sentence that the German military
were keeping in close touch with the Japanese operational plans
against Singapore, which the Nazi conspirators had fostered.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Exhortations to Japanese Aggression Against the U.S.S.R.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators also directed their efforts to induce a
Japanese “stab in the back” against the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics. Here again Ribbentrop appears as a central figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some months prior to the issuance of Basic Order No. 24
regarding collaboration with Japan (<span class='it'>C-75</span>), the Nazi conspirators
had been preparing “<span class='it'>Fall Barbarossa</span>”, the plan for attack
on the U.S.S.R. Basic Order No. 24 decreed, however, that the
Japanese “must not be given any intimation of the Barbarossa
operation”. (<span class='it'>C-75</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his conference with the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka
on 29 March 1941, almost 3 weeks after the issuance of
Basic Order No. 24, Ribbentrop nevertheless hinted at things to
come. Ribbentrop assured Matsuoka that the largest part of
the German Army was on the Eastern frontiers of the Reich
fully prepared to open the attack at any time. Ribbentrop then
added that, although he believed that the U.S.S.R. would try to
avoid developments leading to war, nevertheless a conflict with
the Soviet Union, even if not probable, would have to be considered
possible. (<span class='it'>1877-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever conclusions the Japanese Ambassador drew from
these remarks in April 1941 can only be conjectured. Once the
Nazis had unleashed their aggression against the U.S.S.R. in
June of 1941, the tenor of Ribbentrop’s remarks left no room for
doubt. On 10 July 1941, Ribbentrop despatched a coded telegram
to Ott, the German Ambassador in Tokyo (<span class='it'>2896-PS</span>). Pertinent
passages in that telegram read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Please take this opportunity to thank the Japanese Ambassador
in Moscow for conveying the cable report. It would
be convenient if we could keep on receiving news from Russia
this way. In summing up, I would like to say: I have
<span class='pageno' title='855' id='Page_855'></span>
now, as in the past, full confidence in the Japanese Policy,
and in the Japanese Foreign Minister, first of all because the
present Japanese government would really act inexcusably
toward the future of its nation if it would not take this
unique opportunity to solve the Russian problem, as well as
to secure for all time its expansion to the South and settle
the Chinese matter. Since Russia, as reported by the Japanese
Ambassador in Moscow, is in effect close to collapse, a
report which coincides with our own observations as far as
we are able to judge at the present war situation, it is simply
impossible that Japan does not solve the matter of Vladivostok
and the Siberian area as soon as her military preparations
are completed.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“However, I ask you to employ all available means in further
insisting upon Japan’s entry into the war against Russia at
the soonest possible date, as I have mentioned already in my
note to Matsuoka. The sooner this entry is effected, the
better it is. The natural objective still remains that we and
Japan join hands on the Trans-Siberian railroad, before winter
starts. After the collapse of Russia, however, the position
of the Three Power Pact states in the world will be so
gigantic, that the question of England’s collapse or the total
destruction of the English islands, respectively, will only be
a matter of time. An America totally isolated from the rest
of the world would then be faced with our taking possession
of the remaining positions of the British Empire which are
important for the Three Power Pact countries. I have the
unshakable conviction that a carrying through of the new
order as desired by us will be a matter of course, and there
would be no insurmountable difficulties if the countries of
the Three Power Pact stand close together and encounter
every action of the Americans with the same weapons. I ask
you to report in the near future as often as possible and in
detail on the political situation there.” (<span class='it'>2896-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On subsequent occasions Ribbentrop repeated his exhortations
to induce the Japanese to aggression against the U.S.S.R. Three
documents, covering July of 1942 and March and April of 1943,
record these exhortations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first discussion occurred between Ribbentrop and Oshima,
Japanese Ambassador to Berlin, on 9 July 1942. As a matter of
background, it may be noted that at that time German armies
were sweeping forward in the U.S.S.R. and the fall of Sevastapol
had just been announced. The discussion proceeded as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Notes concerning the discussion between the Minister for
Foreign Affairs and Ambassador Oshima at Steinort, on 9
July 1942.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“He, the German Foreign Minister, had asked to see the
Ambassador at this time when the situation was as described,
because now a question of fateful importance had arisen concerning
the joint conduct of the war: if Japan felt itself
sufficiently strong militarily, the moment for Japan to attack
Russia was probably now. He thought it possible that,
if Japan attacked Russia now, it would lead to her (Russia’s)
final moral collapse; at least it would hasten the collapse
of her present system. In any case, never again would
Japan have such an opportunity as existed at present, to
eliminate once and for all the Russian colossus in Eastern
Asia. He had discussed this question with the Fuehrer, and
the Fuehrer was of the same opinion, but he wanted to emphasize
one point right away: Japan should attack Russia
only if she felt sufficiently strong for such an undertaking.
Under no circumstances should Japanese operations against
Russia be allowed to bog down at the halfway mark, and we
<span class='pageno' title='857' id='Page_857'></span>
do not want to urge Japan into an action that is not mutually
profitable.” (<span class='it'>2911-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop and Ambassador Oshima had another conference
on 6 March 1943. It is noted, again for background, that the
strategic military situation in the broad expanses of the U.S.S.R.
had changed somewhat. In the previous month, February 1943,
the Soviet Armies had completely defeated the German forces at
Stalingrad and inflicted severe losses. To the north and west
their winter offensive had recovered large areas from the hands
of the invaders. In addition, combined U. S. and British forces
had already landed in North Africa. The tone of Ribbentrop’s
argument reflects the changed military situation. The familiar
Japanese refrain of “so sorry please” likewise appears to have
crept in. It is noted, in this regard, that the month of February
1943 had also seen the end of organized Japanese resistance on
the island of Guadalcanal. The conference went as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ambassador Oshima declared that he had received a telegram
from Tokyo, and he is to report by order of his government
to the Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs (RAM) the
following: The suggestion of the German Government, to
attack Russia, was the subject of a common conference between
the Japanese Government and the Imperial headquarters,
during which the question was discussed in detail and
investigated exactly. The result is the following: the Japanese
Government absolutely recognizes the danger which
threatens from Russia, and completely understands the desire
of its German ally that Japan on her part will also enter
the war against Russia. However, it is not possible for the
Japanese Government, considering the present war situation,
to enter into the war. It is rather of the conviction that it
would be in the common interest not to start the war against
Russia now. On the other hand, the Japanese Government
would never disregard the Russian question.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Japanese Government has the intention to become aggressive
again in the future on other fronts.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The RAM brought up the question, after the explanation
by the Ambassador, of how the continued waging of the war
is envisaged in Tokyo. At present, Germany wages the war
against the common enemies, England and America, mostly
alone, while Japan mostly behaves more defensively. However,
it would be more correct that all powers allied in the
Three Power Pact would combine their forces to defeat England
and America, but also Russia together. It is not good
when one part must fight alone. One cannot overstrain the
<span class='pageno' title='858' id='Page_858'></span>
German national strength. He has worried silently that certain
forces work in Tokyo, who are of the opinion and who
propagate it, that Germany would come through the fight
victoriously, and that therefore Japan should consolidate itself
further at first, before it makes further and utmost
efforts.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Then the RAM again brought up the question of the attack
on Russia by Japan, and he declared that after all, the
fight on the Burma front as well as in the South is actually
more of a maritime problem, and on all fronts—except those
in China—there are mostly very few ground forces committed.
Therefore the attack on Russia is primarily an army
affair, and he asked himself whether the necessary forces
would not be ready for that”. (<span class='it'>2954-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop kept on trying. He held another conference with
Oshima about three weeks later, on 18 April 1943. The top
secret notes of this conference reveal the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichminister for Foreign Affairs then stressed again
that without any doubt this year presented the most favorable
opportunity for Japan, if she felt strong enough and
had sufficient anti-tank weapons at her disposal, to attack
Russia, which certainly would never again be as weak as she
is at the moment.” (<span class='it'>2929-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Nazi Preparations and Collaboration with the Japanese
Against the United States.</span> The Nazi preparations and collaboration
with the Japanese against the United States present a
twofold aspect: one of preparations by the Nazis themselves for
attack from across the Atlantic; the other of the fomenting of
war in the Pacific.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the previous discussion of the Nazi exhortations to the
Japanese to war against the British Commonwealth and the
U.S.S.R., reference has been made to certain documents relating
to the United States. Those documents will be taken up again,
in their relevant passages, to show their particular application.
In the treatment of Ribbentrop’s urging the Japanese to war
against the U.S.S.R., documents have been introduced chronicling
conferences which took place after the dates of 7 December and
11 December 1941 when the Japanese and German Governments,
respectively, initiated and declared aggressive war against the
United States. These documents have indicated that Nazi awareness
and acceptance of the direction in which their actions were
<span class='pageno' title='859' id='Page_859'></span>
leading, as well as the universal aspects of their conspiracy and
of their alliance with the Japanese.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Preliminary Nazi Preparations Against the United States.</span>
The Nazi conspirators’ intentions against the United States must
be viewed in the focus of both their over-all plan and their immediate
commitments elsewhere. That their over-all plan involved
ultimate aggressive war against the United States was
intimated by Goering in a speech on 8 July 1938, when the Nazi
conspirators had already forcibly annexed Austria and were
perfecting their plans for occupation of Czechoslovakia. This
speech was delivered to representatives of the aircraft industry
and the copy which the prosecution has obtained was transmitted
as the enclosure to a secret memorandum from Goering’s adjutant
to General Udet, who was then in charge of experimental
research for the Luftwaffe (<span class='it'>R-140</span>). The statement in the
covering memorandum notes that the enclosure is a “copy of the
shorthand minutes of the conference”. In the course of his long
speech, Goering called for increased aircraft production and
referred to the necessity for full mobilization of German industrial
capacity. He continued:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I still am missing entirely the bomber which flies with 5
tons of explosives as far as New York and back. I should
be extremely happy to have such a bomber so that I would at
last be able to stop somewhat the mouth of the arrogant
people over there.” (<span class='it'>R-140</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering’s fervent hope, of course, was not capable of realization
at that time, either technically or in the face of the Nazi
conspirators’ schedule of aggression that has already been outlined.
During the period of their preparation for and waging
of aggressive war in Europe, up through the launching of the
campaign against the U.S.S.R., it is only reasonable to believe
that the Nazi conspirators were not disposed to involve the
United States in war—<span class='it'>at that time</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, even in the fall of 1940, the prosecution of war
against the United States of America at a later date was on the
military agenda. This is clearly shown in a document which
was found in the files of the OKL, the German Air Force
(<span class='it'>376-PS</span>). This memorandum is marked “<span class='it'>Chefsache</span>”—the German
designation for Top Secret—and is directed from a Major
von Falkenstein to an unspecified General, presumably a Luftwaffe
General. Falkenstein, who was a Major of the General
Staff, was at that time the Luftwaffe Liaison Officer with the
Operations Staff of the OKW, which was the staff headed by
Jodl. His memorandum, which he characterizes as a “brief
<span class='pageno' title='860' id='Page_860'></span>
resumé of the military questions current here”, is dated 29
October 1940. It covers several questions. Paragraph 5 states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“5. The Fuehrer is at present occupied with the question
of the occupation of the Atlantic Islands with a view to the
prosecution of war against America at a later date. Deliberations
on this subject are being embarked upon here. Essential
conditions are at the present:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“a. No operational commitment</p>

<p class='pindent'>“b. Portuguese neutrality</p>

<p class='pindent'>“c. Support of France and Spain</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A brief assessment of the possibility of seizing and holding
air bases and of the question of supply is needed from the
GAF.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Major Queisner will fetch the documents for himself from
Ic Kurfurst (C. in C. GAF Rear Hq.). I would like to ask
Colonel Schmidt to arrange that he be supplied with the
information he desires.” (<span class='it'>376-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi Military interest in the United States is further indicated
by paragraph 7:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“7. General von Boetticher has made repeated reference,
especially in his telegram 2314 dated 26/10, to the fact that
in his opinion too many details of our knowledge of American
aircraft industry are being published in the German
press. The matter has been discussed at Armed Forces
Supreme Command. I pointed out that the matter was a
specifically GAF one, but have taken the liberty of referring
the matter to you on its own merits.” (<span class='it'>376-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again in July 1941, in his first flush of confidence resulting
from early gains in the aggression against the U.S.S.R., the
Fuehrer signed an order for further preliminary preparations
for the attack on the United States. This top secret order, found
in files of the German Navy, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“By virtue of the intentions announced in Directive No. 32,
for the further conduct of the War, I lay down the following
principles to govern the strength of personnel and of material
supplies:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. <span class='it'>In general</span>: The military domination of Europe after
the defeat of Russia will enable the strength of the <span class='it'>Army</span>
to be considerably reduced in the near future. As far as
the reduced strength of the Army will allow, the Armoured
units will be greatly increased.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Naval</span> armament must be restricted to those measures
which have a direct connection with the conduct of the war
against England and, should the case arise, against America.
<span class='pageno' title='861' id='Page_861'></span>
“The main effort in armament will be shifted to the <span class='it'>Air
Force</span>, which must be greatly increased in strength.” (<span class='it'>C-74</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Collaboration with the Japanese Against the United States.</span>
From the documents just quoted, it appears that the Nazi conspirators
were making at least preliminary military plans of their
own against the United States. The Nazi over-all plan with regard
to the United States, however, was a complex one, involving
in addition collaboration with the Japanese. In the course of
their repeated representations to the Japanese to undertake an
assault against British possessions in the Pacific-Far East, they
again considered war against the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be recalled that in Basic Order No. 24 regarding collaboration
with the Japanese (<span class='it'>C-75</span>), which was issued on 5 March
1941, the Nazi policy was stated in subparagraph 3<span class='it'>a</span> as aiming
at “forcing England to the ground quickly and thereby keeping
the United States out of the war”. Nevertheless the Nazi conspirators
clearly contemplated within the framework of that
policy the possibility of the United States’ entry into the Far
Eastern conflict which the Nazis were instigating. This could
result from an attack by Japan on United States’ possessions
practically simultaneously with the assault on the British Empire
(as actually happened). Other possibilities of involvement of the
United States were also discussed. Thus, Basic Order No. 24
stated in subparagraph 3 (<span class='it'>c</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c. The raw material situation of the pact powers</span> demands
that Japan should acquire possession of those territories
which it needs for the continuation of the war, especially if
the United States intervenes. Rubber shipments must be
carried out even after the entry of Japan into the war, since
they are of vital importance to Germany.” (<span class='it'>C-75</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The order continues, in the unnumbered paragraph immediately
below subparagraph 3 (<span class='it'>d</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In addition, attacks on other systems of bases of British
naval power—extending to those of American naval power
only if the entry of the United States into the war cannot
be prevented—will result in weakening the enemy’s system
of power in that region and also, just like the attack on sea
communications, in tying down substantial forces of all kinds
(Australia).” (<span class='it'>C-75</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In these passages there is a clear envisionment of U.S. involvement,
as well as a clear intent to attack. The vital threat to
United States’ interests if Japan were to capture Singapore was
also clearly envisaged by Raeder in his meeting of March 1941
with Hitler, Keitel, and Jodl, in which he stated:
<span class='pageno' title='862' id='Page_862'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Japan must take steps to seize Singapore as soon as possible,
since the opportunity will never again be as favourable
(whole English Fleet contained: unpreparedness of U.S.A.
for war against Japan: inferiority of U.S. Fleet vis-a-vis the
Japanese). Japan is indeed making preparations for this
action, but according to all declarations made by Japanese
officers she will only carry it out if Germany proceeds to land
in England. Germany must therefore concentrate all her efforts
on spurring Japan to act immediately. If Japan has
Singapore all other East Asiatic questions regarding the
U.S.A. and England are thereby solved (Guam, Philippines,
Borneo, Dutch East Indies).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Japan wishes if possible to avoid war against U.S.A. She
can do so if she determinedly takes Singapore as soon as
possible.” (<span class='it'>C-152</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop also recognized the possibility of U.S. involvement
as a result of the course of aggression that he was urging on the
Japanese. In his meeting of 23 February 1941 with the Japanese
Ambassador Oshima, the notes of which are contained in (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>),
Ribbentrop assured Matsuoka that a surprise intervention
by Japan was bound to keep the United States out of the war
since she was unarmed and could not risk either her fleet or the
possibility of losing the Philippines as the result of a declaration
of war. Two paragraphs later, Ribbentrop practically dropped
the pretense that the United States would not be involved:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Foreign Minister mentioned further that, if
America should declare war because of Japan’s entry into
the war, this would mean that America had had the intention
to enter the war sooner or later anyway. Even though
it would be preferable to avoid this, the entry into the war
would, as explained above, be by no means decisive and would
not endanger the final victory of the countries of the Three-Power
Pact. The Foreign Minister further expressed his belief
that a temporary lift of the British morale caused by
America’s entry into the war would be cancelled by Japan’s
entry into the war. If, however, contrary to all expectations,
the Americans should be careless enough to send their Navy,
in spite of all, beyond Hawaii and to the Far East, this would
represent the biggest chance for the countries of the Three-Power
Pact to bring the war rapidly to an end. He, the
Foreign Minister, is convinced that the Japanese fleet would
then do a complete job. Ambassador Oshima replied to this
that unfortunately he does not think the Americans would
<span class='pageno' title='863' id='Page_863'></span>
do it, but he is convinced of a victory of his fleet in Japanese
waters.” (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the paragraphs that follow, Ribbentrop again stresses the
mutual interdependence of the Tripartite Pact powers and suggests
coordinated action. He indulged in a typical bit of Nazi
cynicism:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Foreign Minister then touched upon the question,
explicitly pointed out as theoretical, that the contracting
powers might be required, on the basis of new affronts by
the U.S.A., to break off diplomatic relations. Germany and
Italy were fundamentally determined on this; after signing
of the Three-Power Pact we should proceed if the occasion
arises, but also jointly in this matter. Such a lesson should
open the eyes of the people in the U.S.A. to the situation and
under certain conditions bring about a swing toward isolation
in public opinion. Naturally a situation had to be
chosen in which America found herself entirely in the wrong.
The common step of the signatory powers should be exploited
correspondingly in propaganda. The question, however, was
in no way acute at the time.” (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again on 29 March 1941, Ribbentrop—this time in a conference
with the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka—discussed the possible
involvement of the United States. (<span class='it'>1877-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators knew that the aggressive war they were
urging the Japanese to undertake both threatened the vital interests
of the United States and could lead the U.S. to involvement
in the contemplated Far Eastern conflict. This fact is clear
from the report of the conference between Hitler and the Japanese
Foreign Minister Matsuoka in Berlin on 4 April 1941 (<span class='it'>1881-PS</span>).
The report states, in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Matsuoka then also expressed the request that the
Fuehrer should instruct the proper authorities in Germany to
meet as broad-mindedly as possible the wishes of the Japanese
Military Commission. Japan was in need of German
help particularly concerning the U-boat warfare, which could
be given by making available to them the latest experiences
of the war as well as the latest technical improvements and
inventions. Japan would do her utmost to avoid a war with
the United States. In case that the country should decide
to attack Singapore, the Japanese Navy, of course, had to
be prepared for a fight with the United States, because in
that case America probably would side with Great Britain.
He (Matsuoka) personally believed that the United States
would be restrained by diplomatic exertions from entering
<span class='pageno' title='864' id='Page_864'></span>
the war at the side of Great Britain. The Army and Navy
had, however, to count on the worst situation, that is, with
war against America. They were of the opinion that such
a war would extend for five years or longer and would take
the form of guerrilla warfare in the Pacific and would be
fought out in the South Sea. For this reason the German
experiences in her guerrilla warfare are of the greatest value
to Japan. It was a question how such a war would best be
conducted and how all the technical improvements of submarines,
in all details such as periscopes and such like, could
best be exploited by Japan.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“To sum up, Matsuoka requested that the Fuehrer should see
to it that the proper German authorities would place at the
disposal of the Japanese those developments and inventions
concerning Navy and Army, which were needed by the Japanese.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer promised this and pointed out that Germany
too considered a conflict with the United States undesirable,
but that it had already made allowances for such a contingency.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Matsuoka once more repeated his request that the Fuehrer
might give the necessary instructions, in order that the
proper German authorities would place at the disposal of the
Japanese the latest improvement and inventions, which are
of interest to them, because the Japanese Navy had to prepare
immediately for a conflict with the United States.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“As regards Japanese-American relationship, Matsuoka explained
further that he has always declared in his country
that sooner or later a war with the United States would be
unavoidable, if Japan continued to drift along as at present.
In his opinion this conflict would happen rather sooner than
later. His argumentation went on, why should Japan, therefore,
not decisively strike at the right moment and take the
risk upon herself of a fight against America?” (<span class='it'>1881-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The passages just quoted show not only a realization of the
probable involvement of the United States in the Far Eastern
conflict that the Nazis were urging, but also a knowledge on their
part that the Japanese Army and Navy were actually preparing
war plans against the United States. Furthermore, the Nazis
knew at least a part of what those war plans were. This fact
is revealed in a secret telegram from the German military-attache
in Tokyo, dated 24 May 1941 (<span class='it'>1538-PS</span>). The attache reports
<span class='pageno' title='865' id='Page_865'></span>
the conferences he has had regarding Japan’s entry in the war
in the event Germany should become involved in war with the
United States. In paragraph 1, this sentence appears:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Preparations for attack on Singapore and Manila stand.”
(<span class='it'>1538-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A review of the Nazi position with regard to the United States
at this point, the Spring of 1941, shows that in view of their
press of commitments elsewhere and their aggressive plans
against the U.S.S.R., set for execution in June of 1941, their
temporary strategy was naturally a preference that the United
States not be involved in war at that time. Nevertheless they
had been considering their own preliminary plans against the
United States, as seen in the Atlantic Islands document (<span class='it'>376-PS</span>).
They were repeatedly urging the Japanese to aggression against
the British Commonwealth, just as they would urge them to attack
the U.S.S.R. soon after the launching of the Nazi invasion.
They were aware that the course along which they were pushing
the Japanese in the Far East would probably lead to involvement
of the United States. Indeed, the Japanese Foreign Minister
had told Hitler this in so many words, and their own military
men had fully realized the implications of the move against
Singapore. They knew also that the Japanese Army and Navy
were preparing operational plans against the United States.
They knew at least part of those plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators not only knew all these things. They
accepted the risk of the aggressive course they were urging on
the Japanese and pushed their Eastern allies still farther along
that course. On 4 April 1941, Hitler told the Japanese Foreign
Minister that in the event Japan were to become involved in war
with the United States, Germany would immediately take the
consequences and strike without delay. The following is a passage
from the notes of the Hitler-Matsuoka conference in Berlin
on 4 April 1941:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the further course of the discussion the Fuehrer pointed
out that Germany on her part would immediately take the
consequences, if Japan would get involved with the United
States. It did not matter with whom the United States
would first get involved, if with Germany or with Japan.
They would always try to eliminate one country at a time,
not to come to an understanding with the other country
subsequently, but to liquidate this one just the same. Therefore
Germany would strike, as already mentioned, without
delay in case of a conflict between Japan and America, because
the strength of the tripartite powers lies in their
<span class='pageno' title='866' id='Page_866'></span>
joined action. Their weakness would be if they would let
themselves be beaten individually.” (<span class='it'>1881-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Hitler then encouraged Matsuoka in his decision to strike against
the United States:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer replied that he could well understand the situation
of Matsuoka, because he himself was in similar situations
(the clearing of the Rhineland, declaration of sovereignty
of armed Forces). He too was of the opinion that
he had to exploit favorable conditions and accept the risk
of an anyhow unavoidable fight at a time when he himself
was still young and full of vigor. How right he was in his
attitude was proven by events. Europe now was free. He
would not hesitate a moment to instantly reply to any widening
of the war, be it by Russia, be it by America. Providence
favored those who will not let dangers come to them,
but who will bravely face them.” (<span class='it'>1881-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here, in the passages just quoted, were assurance, encouragement,
and abetment by the head of the German State, the leading
Nazi co-conspirator, in April 1941. But the Nazi encouragement
and promise of support did not end there. Another telegram
from the German Ambassador in Tokyo regarding conversations
with the Japanese Foreign Minister, dated 30 November
1941, one week before Pearl Harbor, read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The progress of the negotiations so far confirms his viewpoint
that the difference of opinion between Japan and the
U.S. is very great. The Japanese Government since it sent
Ambassador Kurusu has taken a firm stand, as he told me.
He is convinced that this position is in our favor and makes
the United States think that her entry into the European
war would be risky business. The new American proposal
of 25 November showed great divergences in the viewpoints
of the two nations. These differences of opinion concern,
for example, the further treatment of the Chinese question.
The biggest (one word missing) however resulted from the
U. S. attempt to make the three-power agreement ineffective.
U. S. suggested to Japan to conclude treaties of nonaggression
with the U. S., the British Empire, the Soviet Union,
and other countries in order to prevent Japan’s entry into
the war on the side of the Axis powers. Japan, however,
insisted upon maintaining her treaty obligations and for
this reason American demands are the greatest obstacles
for adjusting Japanese-American relations. He avoided
discussing concessions promised by the U. S. and merely
mentioned that grave decisions were at stake.
<span class='pageno' title='867' id='Page_867'></span>
“The U.S. is seriously preparing for war and is about to
operate a considerable part of its fleet from Southern Pacific
bases. The Japanese Government is busy working out
an answer in order to clarify its viewpoint. But he has no
particulars at that moment. He thinks the American proposals,
as a whole, unacceptable.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Japan is not afraid of a breakdown of negotiations and
she hopes that in that case Germany and Italy, according to
the Three Power Agreement, would stand at her side. I
answered that there could be no doubt about Germany’s
future position. The Japanese Foreign Minister thereupon
stated that he understood from my words that Germany in
such a case would consider her relationship to Japan as that
of a community of fate. I answered, according to my opinion,
Germany was certainly ready to have mutual agreement
between the two countries over this situation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Minister of Foreign Affairs answered that it was possible
that he would come back to this point soon. The conversation
with the Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed the impression
that the U. S. note, in fact, is very unsatisfactory
even for the compromise-seeking politicians here. For these
circles America’s position, especially in the China question,
is very disappointing. The emphasis upon the Three Power
Pact as being the main obstacle between successful Japanese-U.&nbsp;S.
negotiations seems to point to the fact that the
Japanese Government is becoming aware of the necessity of
close cooperation with the Axis powers.” (<span class='it'>2898-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Extracts from the handwritten diary of Count Galleazzo Ciano
during the period 3 December to 8 December 1941 fill in the
picture (<span class='it'>2987-PS</span>). These are taken from notes which Ciano
jotted down in the course of his daily business as Foreign Minister
of Italy. The entries for 3, 4, and 5 December read:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>December 3.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Wednesday</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Sensational move by Japan. The Ambassador asks for
an audience with the Duce and reads him a long statement
on the progress of the negotiations with America, concluding
with the assertion that they have reached a dead end.
Then, invoking the appropriate clause in the Tripartite Pact,
he asks that Italy declare war on America immediately after
the outbreak of hostilities and proposes the signature of an
agreement not to conclude a separate peace. The interpreter
translating this request was trembling like a leaf. The Duce
gave fullest assurances, reserving the right to confer with
<span class='pageno' title='868' id='Page_868'></span>
Berlin before giving a reply. The Duce was pleased with
the communication and said: “We are now on the brink of
the inter-continental war which I predicted as early as September
1939.” What does this new event mean? In any
case, it means that Roosevelt has succeeded in his maneuver.
Since he could not enter into the war immediately and
directly, he has entered it indirectly by letting himself be
attacked by Japan. Furthermore, this event also means that
every prospect of peace is becoming further and further
removed, and that it is now easy—much too easy—to predict
a long war. Who will be able to hold out longest? It
is on this basis that the problem must be considered. Berlin’s
answer will be somewhat delayed, because Hitler has
gone to the southern front to see General Kleist, whose armies
continue to give way under the pressure of an unexpected
Soviet offensive.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>December 4.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Thursday</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Berlin’s reaction to the Japanese move is extremely cautious.
Perhaps they will accept because they cannot get out
of it, but the idea of provoking America’s intervention
pleases the Germans less and less. Mussolini, on the other
hand, is pleased about it. * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>December 5.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Friday</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“A night interrupted by Ribbentrop’s restlessness. After delaying
two days, now he cannot wait a minute to answer the
Japanese and at three in the morning he sent Mackenson to
my house to submit a plan for a triple agreement relative to
Japanese intervention and the pledge not to make a separate
peace. He wanted me to awaken the Duce, but I did not do
so, and the latter was very glad I hadn’t * * *.” (<span class='it'>2987-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It appears from the last entry that some sort of agreement was
reached. On Sunday, 7 December 1941, Japan without previous
warning or declaration of war commenced an attack against the
United States at Pearl Harbor and against the British Commonwealth
of Nations in the Southwest Pacific. On the morning of
11 December, four days after the Japanese assault in the Pacific,
the German Government declared war on the United States.
(<span class='it'>2507-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same day, 11 December 1941, the Congress of the United
States resolved that “the state of war between the United States
and the Government of Germany which has thus been thrust
upon the United States is hereby formally declared”. (<span class='it'>2945-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='869' id='Page_869'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It thus appears that, apart from their own aggressive intentions
and declaration of war against the United States, the Nazi
conspirators in their collaboration with Japan incited and kept
in motion a force reasonably calculated to result in an attack on
the United States. While maintaining their preference that the
United States not be involved in the war at the time, they nevertheless
foresaw the distinct possibility, even probability of such
involvement as a result of the actions they were encouraging;
they were aware that the Japanese had prepared plans for attack
against the United States; and they accepted the consequences
by assuring the Japanese that they would declare war on the
United States should a U.S.-Japanese conflict result. In dealing
with captured documents of the enemy, the completeness of the
plan is necessarily obscured. But those documents which have
been discovered, and introduced into evidence before the Tribunal,
show that the Japanese attack was the proximate and foreseeable
consequence of their collaboration policy, and that their
exhortations and encouragement of the Japanese as surely led
to Pearl Harbor as though Pearl Harbor itself had been mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entry in the Ciano Diary for 8 December 1941 gives an interesting
sidelight on Ribbentrop’s reaction to the Japanese sneak
attack:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>December 8.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Monday.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“A night telephone call from Ribbentrop; he is overjoyed
about the Japanese attack on America. He is so happy about
it that I am happy with him, though I am not too sure about
the final advantages of what has happened. One thing is now
certain: that America will enter the conflict, and that the
conflict will be so long that she will be able to realize all her
potential force. This morning I told this to the King who
had been pleased about the event. He ended by admitting
that in the “long run” I may be right. Mussolini was happy
too. For a long time he has favored a definite clarification
of relations between America and the Axis.” (<span class='it'>2987-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A conference was held between Hitler and Japanese Ambassador
Oshima on 14 December 1941, from 1300 to 1400 hours, in
the presence of the Reich Foreign Minister, Ribbentrop. The subject
matter was the Pearl Harbor attack. The top secret notes of
this conference read in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * First the Fuehrer presents Ambassador Oshima
with the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the German
Eagle in gold. With cordial words he acknowledges his services
<span class='pageno' title='870' id='Page_870'></span>
in the achievement of German-Japanese cooperation,
which has now obtained its culmination in a close brotherhood
of arms.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“General Oshima expresses his thanks for the great honor
and emphasizes how glad he is that this brotherhood of arms
has now come about between Germany and Japan.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer continues: “You gave the right declaration of
war!” This method is the only proper one. Japan pursued it
formerly and it corresponds with his own system, that is, to
negotiate as long as possible. But if one sees that the other
is interested only in putting one off, in shaming and humiliating
one, and is not willing to come to an agreement, then
one should strike—as hard as possible, indeed—and not waste
time declaring war. It was heartwarming to him to hear of
the first operations of the Japanese. He himself negotiated
with infinite patience at times, for example, with Poland and
also with Russia. When he then realized, that the other did
not want to come to an agreement, he struck suddenly and
without formalities. He would continue to go this way in the
future.” (<span class='it'>2932-PS</span>)</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='875' id='Page_875'></span><h1>Chapter X<br/> THE SLAVE LABOR PROGRAM,<br/> THE ILLEGAL USE OF PRISONERS<br/> OF WAR, AND THE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY<br/> OF SAUCKEL AND SPEER THEREFOR</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In general terms, the basic elements of the Nazi foreign labor
policy consisted of mass deportation and mass enslavement. It
was a policy of underfeeding and overworking foreign laborers,
of subjecting them to every form of degradation and brutality.
It was a policy which compelled foreign workers and prisoners of
war to manufacture armaments and to engage in other operations
of war directed against their own countries. It was, in short, a
policy which constituted a flagrant violation of the laws of war
and the laws of humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritz Sauckel and Albert Speer are principally responsible for
the formulation of this policy and for its execution. Sauckel, the
Nazi’s Plenipotentiary General for Manpower, directed the recruitment,
deportation, and allocation of foreign civilian labor.
Sanctioning and directing the use of force as a means of recruitment,
he was responsible for the mistreatment of the enslaved
millions. Speer—as Reichsminister for Armaments and Munitions,
Director of the Organization Todt, and member of the Central
Planning Board—bears responsibility for the determination
of the numbers of foreign slaves required by the German war
machine, for the decision to recruit by force, and for the use and
brutal treatment of foreign civilians and prisoners of war in the
manufacture of armaments and munitions, in the construction of
fortifications, and in active military operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hermann Goering, as Plenipotentiary General for the Four
Year Plan, is also responsible for all the crimes involved in the
Nazi slave labor program. In addition, Alfred Rosenberg as
Reichsminister for the Occupied Eastern Territories, Hans Frank
as Governor-General of the Government-General of Poland, Artur
Seyss-Inquart as Reichskommissar for the Occupied Netherlands,
and Wilhelm Keitel as chief of the OKW share responsibility for
the recruitment by force and terror and for the deportation to
Germany of the citizens of the areas overrun or subjugated by
the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>.</p>

<h3>1. PLANNING FOR THE USE OF SLAVE LABOR</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The use of vast numbers of foreign workers was planned before
Germany went to war and was an integral part of the conspiracy
for waging aggressive war. On 23 May 1939 a meeting
was held in Hitler’s study at the Reichs Chancellery. Goering,
<span class='pageno' title='876' id='Page_876'></span>
Raeder, and Keitel were present. According to the minutes of
this meeting, (<span class='it'>L-79</span>) Hitler stated that he intended to attack
Poland at the first suitable opportunity. He further stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * If fate brings us into contact with the West, the
possession of extensive areas in the East will be advantageous.
We shall be able to rely upon record harvests, even
less in time of war than in peace.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The population of non-German areas will perform no military
service, and will be available as a source of labor”.
(<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The slave labor program was designed to achieve two purposes.
The primary purpose was to satisfy the labor requirements of the
Nazi war machine by compelling foreign workers, in effect, to
make war against their own countries and its allies. The secondary
purpose was to destroy or weaken peoples deemed inferior
by the Nazi racialists, or deemed potentially hostile by the Nazi
planners of world supremacy. These purposes were expressed by
the conspirators themselves. In Sauckel’s Labor Mobilization
Program (<span class='it'>016-PS</span>) which he sent to Rosenberg on 20 April 1942,
Sauckel declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The aim of this new, gigantic labor mobilization
is to use all the rich and tremendous sources, conquered and
secured for us by our fighting Armed Forces under the leadership
of Adolf Hitler, for the armament of the Armed Forces
and also for the nutrition of the Homeland. The raw materials
as well as the fertility of the conquered territories and
their human labor power are to be used completely and conscientiously
to the profit of Germany and their allies.”
(<span class='it'>016-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The theory of the “master race,” which underlay the conspirators’
labor policy in the East, was expressed in the following
words by Erich Koch, Reichskommissar for the Ukraine, at a
meeting of the National Socialist Party on 5 March 1943 in Kiev:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. We are the master race and must govern hard but just
* * *.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. I will draw the very last out of this country. I did not
come to spread bliss. I have come to help the Fuehrer. The
population must work, work, and work again * * * for
some people are getting excited, that the population may not
get enough to eat. The population cannot demand that, one
has only to remember what our heroes were deprived of in
Stalingrad * * *. We definitely did not come here to
give out manna. We have come here to create the basis for
victory.
<span class='pageno' title='877' id='Page_877'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. We are a master race, which must remember that the lowliest
German worker is racially and biologically a thousand
times more valuable than the population here”. (<span class='it'>1130-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And in a speech delivered to a group of SS Generals on 4 October
1943 at Posen, Himmler stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not
interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in
the way of good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary
by kidnapping their children and raising them here with us.
Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests
me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our
<span class='it'>Kultur</span>: otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000
Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging
an anti-tank ditch interests me only in so far as the anti-tank
ditch for Germany is finished * * *.” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A Top Secret memorandum prepared for the Ministry of the
Occupied Eastern Territories on 12 June 1944, and approved by
Rosenberg, contains the following plans:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Army Group ‘Center’ has the intention to apprehend
40-50,000 youths at the ages of 10 to 14 who are in the Army
territory and to transport them to the Reich * * *.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is intended to allot these juveniles primarily to the German
trades as apprentices to be used as skilled workers after
2 years’ training. This is to be arranged through the Organization
Todt which is especially equipped for such a task
through its technical and other set-ups. This action is being
greatly welcomed by the German trade since it represents a
decisive measure for the alleviation of the shortage of apprentices.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. This action is not only aimed at preventing a direct reinforcement
of the enemy’s military strength, but also at a
reduction of his biological potentialities as viewed from the
perspective of the future. These ideas have been voiced not
only by the Reichsfuehrer of the SS but also by the Fuehrer.
Corresponding orders were given during last year’s withdrawals
in the southern sector * * *.”(<span class='it'>031-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Rosenberg’s approval is at the end of the document:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“regarding the above—Obergruppenfuehrer Berger received
the memorandum on June 14. Consequently the Reichsminister
has approved the Action.” (<span class='it'>031-PS</span>)</p>

</div>
<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='878' id='Page_878'></span></p>

<h3>2. EXECUTION OF THE SLAVE LABOR PROGRAM</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The purposes of the slave labor program, namely, the strengthening
of the Nazi war machine and the destruction or weakening
of peoples deemed inferior, were achieved by the impressment
and deportation of millions of persons into Germany for forced
labor, by the separation of husbands from their wives and children
from their parents, and by the imposition of conditions so
inhuman that countless numbers perished.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Poland.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Poland was the first victim. Frank, as Governor of the Government-General
of Poland, announced that under his program
1,000,000 workers were to be sent to Germany, and recommended
that police surround Polish villages and seize the inhabitants for
deportation. These intentions appear in the following letter from
Frank to Goering, dated 25 January 1940 (<span class='it'>1375-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. In view of the present requirements of the Reich for the
defense industry, it is at present fundamentally impossible
to carry on a long term economic policy in the General-Gouvernement.
Rather, it is necessary so to steer the economy of
the General Gouvernement that it will, in the shortest possible
time, accomplish results representing the maximum that can
be gotten out of the economic strength of the General-Gouvernement
for the immediate strengthening of our capacity for
defense.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. In particular the following performances are expected of
the total economy of the General-Gouvernement * * *.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(g) Supply and transportation of at least 1 million male
and female agricultural and industrial workers to the Reich—among
them at least 7,500,000 [sic] agricultural workers
of which at least 50% must be women—in order to guarantee
agricultural production in the Reich and as a replacement</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The methods by which these workers were to be supplied were
outlined by Frank in his diary entry for Friday, 10 May 1940
(<span class='it'>2233-A-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Then the Governor-General deals with the problem
of the <span class='it'>Compulsory Labor Service</span> of the Poles. Upon the demands
from the Reich it has now been decreed that compulsion
may be exercised in view of the fact that sufficient manpower
was not voluntarily available for service inside the
German Reich. This compulsion means the possibility of arrest
<span class='pageno' title='879' id='Page_879'></span>
of male and female Poles. Because of these measures a
certain disquietude had developed which, according to individual
reports, was spreading very much, and which might produce
difficulties everywhere. General Fieldmarshal Goering
some time ago pointed out in his long speech the necessity to
deport into the Reich a million workers. The supply so far
was 160,000. However, great difficulties had to be overcome.
Therefore it would be advisable to consult the district and
town chiefs in the execution of the compulsion, so that one
could be sure from the start that this action would be reasonably
successful. The arrest of young Poles when leaving
church service or the cinema would bring about an increasing
nervousness of the Poles. Generally speaking, he had no objections
at all if the rubbish, capable of work yet often loitering
about, would be snatched from the streets. The best
method for this, however, would be the organization of a
raid, and it would be absolutely justifiable to stop a Pole in
the street and to question him what he was doing, where he
was working etc.” (<span class='it'>2233-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another entry in the diary of Frank, for 16 March 1940, contains
the following discourse on methods:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The Governor-General remarks that he had long
negotiations in Berlin with representatives of the Reich Ministry
for Finance and the Reich Ministry for Food. One has
made the urgent demand there that <span class='it'>Polish farm workers</span>
should be sent to the Reich in greater numbers. He has made
the statement in Berlin that he, if it is demanded from him,
can naturally exercise force in such a manner that he has
the police surround a village and get the men and women,
in question, out by force, and then send them to Germany.
But one can also work differently, besides these police measures,
by retaining the unemployment compensation of those
workers in question.” (<span class='it'>2233-B-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The instruments of force and terror used to carry out this program
reached into many phases of Polish life. German labor
authorities raided churches and theatres, seized those present,
and shipped them to Germany. These facts appear in a memorandum
to Himmler dated 17 April 1943, written by Dr. Lammers,
chief of the Reichs Chancellery, with regard to the situation in
the Government General of Poland:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * As things were, the utilization of manpower had
to be enforced by means of more or less forceful methods,
such as the instances when certain groups appointed by the
Labor Offices, caught Church and Movie-goers here and there
<span class='pageno' title='880' id='Page_880'></span>
and transported them into the Reich. That such methods not
only undermine the people’s willingness to work and the
people’s confidence to such a degree that it cannot be checked
even with terror, is just as clear as the consequences brought
about by a strengthening of the political resistance movement”.
(<span class='it'>2220-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Polish farmland was confiscated with the aid of the SS, distributed
to German inhabitants, or held in trust for the German
community. The farm owners were thereupon employed as laborers
or transported to Germany against their will. A report of
the SS entitled “Achievement of Confiscations of Polish Agricultural
Enterprises with the Purpose to Transfer the Poles to the
old Reich and to Employ Them as Agricultural Workers,” contains
these disclosures:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * It is possible without difficulty to accomplish the
confiscation of small agricultural enterprises in the villages
in which larger agricultural enterprises have been already
confiscated and are under the management of the East German
Corporation for agricultural development. * * *
<span class='it'>The former owners of Polish farms, together with their
families will be transferred to the old Reich by the employment
agencies for employment as farm workers.</span> In this
way many hundreds of Polish agricultural workers can be
placed at the disposal of agriculture in the old Reich in the
shortest and simplest manner. This way the most pressing
shortage is removed that is now in a very disagreeable manner
felt especially in the root-crop districts.” (<span class='it'>1352-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Pursuant to the directions of Sauckel, his agents and the SS
deported Polish men to Germany without their families, thereby
accomplishing the basic purposes of the program: supplying labor
for the German war effort and weakening the reproductive potential
of the Polish people. Thus, in a letter from Sauckel to the
Presidents of the “Landes” Employment Offices, dated 26 November
1942, it is stated that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In agreement with the Chief of the Security Police and the
SD, Jews who are still in employment are, from now on, to
be evacuated from the territory of the Reich and are to be
replaced by Poles, who are being deported from the General-Gouvernement.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Poles who are to be evacuated as a result of this measure
will be put into concentration camps and put to work
where they are criminal or asocial elements. The remaining
<span class='pageno' title='881' id='Page_881'></span>
Poles where they are suitable for labor, will be transported—without
family—into the Reich, particularly to Berlin; there
they will be put at the disposal of the labor allocation offices
to work in armament factories instead of the Jews who are
to be replaced.” (<span class='it'>L-61</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi campaign of force, terror, and abduction was described
in a letter to Frank written by the Chairman of the
Ukrainian Main Committee, at Cracow, in February 1943. The
letter states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The general nervousness is still more enhanced by the wrong
methods of finding labor which have been used more and
more frequently in recent months.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The wild and ruthless man-hunt as exercised everywhere in
towns and country, in streets, squares, stations, even in
churches, at night in houses, has badly shaken the feeling of
security of the inhabitants. Everybody is exposed to the
danger, to be seized anywhere and at any time by members
of the police, suddenly and unexpectedly and to be brought
into an assembly camp. None of his relatives knows what
has happened to him, only months later one or the other
gives news of his fate by a postcard.” (<span class='it'>1526-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And in enclosure 5 of the letter it is related that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In November of last year an inspection of all males of the
age groups 1910 to 1920 was ordered in the area of Zaleschozyki
(district of Czortkow). After the men had appeared
for inspection, all those who were chosen were arrested
at once, loaded into trains and sent to the Reich. Such
recruiting of laborers for the Reich also took place in other
areas of this district. Following some interventions the action
was then stopped”. (<span class='it'>1526-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The resistance of the Polish people to this Nazi enslavement
program and the necessity for increased force were described by
Sauckel’s deputy Timm at a meeting of the Central Planning
Board, Hitler’s wartime planning agency, which was composed
of Speer, Field Marshal Milch, and State Secretary Koerner. The
Central Planning Board was the highest level economic planning
agency, and exercised production controls by allocating raw materials
and labor to industrial users. Timm’s statement, which
was made at the 36th conference of the Board, is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Especially in Poland the situation at the moment
is extraordinarily serious. It is well known that vehement
battle occurred just because of these actions. The resistance
against the administration established by us, is very strong.
Quite a number of our men have been exposed to increased
<span class='pageno' title='882' id='Page_882'></span>
dangers, and it was just in the last two or three weeks that
some of them were shot dead, e.g. the Head of the Labor
Office of Warsaw who was shot in his office, and yesterday
another man again. This is how matters stand presently,
and the recruiting itself even if done with the best will remains
extremely difficult unless police reinforcements are at
hand.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>The Occupied Eastern Territories.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Deportation and enslavement of civilians reached unprecedented
levels in the Occupied Eastern Territories as a direct result of
labor demands made by Sauckel on Rosenberg, Reichsminister
for the Occupied Eastern Territories, on Rosenberg’s subordinates,
and on the Armed Forces. On 5 October 1942, for example,
Sauckel wrote to Rosenberg stating that 2,000,000 more foreign
laborers were required, and that the majority of these would
have to be drafted from the recently occupied Eastern Territories
and especially from the Ukraine. The letter, (<span class='it'>017-PS</span>)
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer has worked out new and most urgent plans for
the armament which require the quick mobilization of two
more million foreign labor forces. The Fuehrer therefore
has granted me, for the execution of my decree of 21
March 1942, new powers for my new duties, and has especially
authorized me to take whatever measures I think are
necessary in the Reich, the Protectorate, the General-Gouvernement,
as well as in the occupied territories, in order
to assure at all costs an orderly mobilization of labor
for the German armament industry. The additional required
labor forces will have to be drafted for the majority
from the recently occupied Eastern Territories, especially
from the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Therefore, the
Reichskommissariat Ukraine must furnish:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“225,000 labor forces by 31 December 1942 and 225,000
more by 1 May 1943.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I ask you to inform Reichskommissar Gauleiter party
fellow member Koch about the new situation and requirements
and especially to see to it that he will support personally
in any possible way the execution of this new requirement.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I have the intention to visit Party member Koch shortly
and I would be grateful to you if you could inform me as to
where and when I could meet him for a personal discussion.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Right now though, I ask that the procurement be taken
<span class='pageno' title='883' id='Page_883'></span>
up at once with every possible pressure and the commitment
of all powers especially also of the experts of the
labor offices. All the directives which had limited temporarily
the procurement of Eastern laborers are annulled.
The Reichs procurement for the next months must be given
priority over all other measures.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I do not ignore the difficulties which exist for the execution
of this new requirement, but I am convinced that with
the ruthless commitment of all resources, and with the full
cooperation of all those interested, the execution of the new
demands can be accomplished for the fixed date. I have
already communicated the new demands to the Reichskommissar
Ukraine via mail. In reference to our long distance
phone call of today I will send you the text of the Fuehrer’s
decree at the beginning of next week.” (<span class='it'>017-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again on 17 March 1943 Sauckel wrote Rosenberg, demanding
the importation of another 1,000,000 men and women from the
Eastern territories within the following four months (<span class='it'>019-PS</span>).
Sauckel said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“After a protracted illness my Deputy for Labor Supply in
the occupied Eastern Territories, State Councillor Peukert,
is going there to regulate the labor supply both for Germany
and the territories themselves.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I ask you sincerely, dear party member Rosenberg, to assist
him to your utmost on account of the pressing urgency of
Peukert’s mission. Already now I may thank you for the
hitherto good reception accorded to Peukert. He himself
has been charged by me with the absolute and completely
unreserved cooperation with all bureaus of the Eastern Territories.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Especially the labor supply for the German agriculture, and
likewise for the most urgent armament production programs
ordered by the Fuehrer make the fastest importation of approximately
1 million women and men from the Eastern
Territories within the next four months a must. Starting
15 March the daily shipment must have reached 5,000 female
and male workers respectively, while beginning of April this
number has to be stepped up to 10,000. This is a requisite
of the most urgent programs, and the spring tillage, and
other agricultural tasks are not to suffer for the detriment
of the nutrition and of the armed forces.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I have foreseen the allotment of the draft quotas for the
individual territories in agreement with your experts for
the labor supply as follows:—
<span class='pageno' title='884' id='Page_884'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Daily quota starting 15 March 1943:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Starting 1 April 1943 the daily quota is to be doubled corresponding
to the doubling of the entire quota.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I hope to visit personally the Eastern Territories towards
the end of the month, and ask you once more for your kind
support.” (<span class='it'>019-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel travelled to Kauen in Lithuania to press his demands.
A synopsis of a report of the City Commissioner of Kauen and
minutes of a meeting in which Sauckel participated, reveal that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In a lecture which the Plenipotentiary for the <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span>,
Gauleiter Sauckel made on 18 July 1943 in Kauen and
in an official conference following it, between Gauleiter
Sauckel and the General Commissar, the pool of labor in the
Reich was again brought up urgently: Gauleiter Sauckel
again demanded that Lithuanian labor be furnished in
greater volume for the purposes of the Reich.” (<span class='it'>204-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel also visited Riga, Latvia, to assert his demands. The
purpose of this visit is described in a letter from the Reich Commissar
for the Ostland to the Commissioner General in Riga,
dated 3 May 1943. The letter states, in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In reference to the basic statements of the Plenipotentiary
General for manpower, Gauleiter Sauckel on the occasion of
his visit to Riga on 21 April 1943, and in view of the critical
situation and in disregard of all contrary considerations, it
was decided that a total of 183,000 workers have to be supplied
from the Ostland for the Reich territory. This task
must absolutely be accomplished within the next four months
and at the latest must be completed by the end of August.”
(<span class='it'>2280-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel asked the German Army for assistance in the recruitment
and deportation of civilian labor from the Eastern Territories.
A secret organization order of the Army Group South,
dated 17 August 1943, is to the following effect:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Plenipotentiary General for Labor Employment ordered
the recruitment and employment of all born during
two years for the whole, newly occupied Eastern territory
in Decree Az. VI A 5780.28 (Inclosure 1), copy of which is
<span class='pageno' title='885' id='Page_885'></span>
inclosed. The Reich Minister for Armament and Munition
approved this order.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“According to this order by the Plenipotentiary General for
Labor Employment (BGA) you have to recruit and to transport
to the Reich immediately all labor forces in your territory
born during 1926 and 1927. The decree relative labor
duty and labor employment in the theater of operations of
the newly occupied Eastern territory of the 6 February 1943
and the executive orders therefore are the authority for the
execution of this measure. Enlistment must be completed
by 30 Sept. 43 at the latest.” (<span class='it'>3010-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Clearly, the demands made by Sauckel did result in the deportation
of civilians from the occupied Eastern territories. Speer
has stated in a record of conferences with Hitler on 10, 11, and 12
August 1942 that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Gauleiter Sauckel promises to make Russian labor available
for the fulfillment of the iron and coal program and reports
that—if required—he can supply a further million Russian
laborers for the German armament industry up to and
including October 1942. So far, he has already supplied 1
million for industry and 700,000 for agriculture. In this connection
the Fuehrer states that the problem of providing
labor can be solved in all cases and to any extent; he authorizes
Gauleiter Sauckel to take all measures required.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“He would agree to any necessary compulsion (<span class='it'>zwangsmassnahmen</span>)
in the East as well as in the West if this
question could not be solved on a voluntary basis.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>3. VIOLENT METHODS OF DEPORTATION FOR SLAVE LABOR</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In order to meet these demands, the Nazi conspirators made
terror, violence, and arson the staple instruments of their policy
of enslavement. Twenty days after Sauckel’s demands of 5 October
1942, a high official in Rosenberg’s Ministry by the name of
Braeutigam, in a Top Secret memorandum dated 25 October 1942
described measures taken to meet these demands:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * We now experienced the grotesque picture of having
to recruit millions of laborers from the Occupied Eastern
Territories, after prisoners of war have died of hunger like
flies, in order to fill the gaps that have formed within Germany.
Now the food question no longer existed. In the prevailing
limitless abuse of the Slavic humanity ‘recruiting’
methods were used which probably have their origin in the
blackest periods of the slave trade. A regular manhunt was
<span class='pageno' title='886' id='Page_886'></span>
inaugurated. Without consideration of health or age the
people were shipped to Germany where it turned out immediately
that more than 100,000 had to be sent back because
of serious illnesses and other incapabilities for work.”
(<span class='it'>294-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg on 21 December 1942 wrote to Sauckel, the instigator
of these brutalities, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The reports I have received show, that the increase of the
guerilla bands in the occupied Eastern Regions is largely due
to the fact that the methods used for procuring laborers in
these regions are felt to be forced measures of mass deportations,
so that the endangered persons prefer to escape their
fate by withdrawing into the woods or going to the guerilla
bands.” (<span class='it'>018-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>An attachment to Rosenberg’s letter, consisting of parts excerpted
from letters of residents of the Occupied Eastern territories
by Nazi censors, relates that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“At our place, new things have happened. People are being
taken to Germany. On Dec. 5, some people from the Kowkuski
district were scheduled to go, but they didn’t want to
and the village was set afire. They threatened to do the
same thing in Borowytschi, as not all who were scheduled
to depart wanted to go. Thereupon 3 truck loads of Germans
arrived and set fire to their houses. In Wrasnytschi 12 houses
and in Borowytschi 3 houses were burned.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On Oct. 1 a new conscription of labor forces took place.
From what has happened, I will describe the most important
to you. You can not imagine the bestiality. You probably
remember what we were told about the Soviets during the
rule of the Poles. At that time we did not believe it and
now it seems just as incredible. The order came to supply
25 workers, but no one reported. All had fled. Then the German
militia came and began to ignite the houses of those
who had fled. The fire became very violent, since it had not
rained for 2 months. In addition the grain stacks were in the
farm yards. You can imagine what took place. The people
who had hurried to the scene were forbidden to extinguish
the flames, beaten and arrested, so that 7 homesteads burned
down. The policemen meanwhile ignited other houses. The
people fell on their knees and kiss their hands, but the policemen
beat them with rubber truncheons and threaten to burn
down the whole village. I don’t know how this would have
ended if I Sapurkany had not intervened. He promised that
there would be laborers by morning. During the fire the
<span class='pageno' title='887' id='Page_887'></span>
militia went through the adjoining villages, seized the laborers
and brought them under arrest. Wherever they did
not find any laborers, they detained the parents, until the
children appeared. That is how they raged throughout the
night in Bielosirka. The workers which had not yet appeared
till then, were to be shot. All schools were closed
and the married teachers were sent to work here, while the
unmarried ones go to work in Germany. They are now catching
humans like the dog-catchers used to catch dogs. They
are already hunting for one week and have not yet enough.
The imprisoned workers are locked in at the schoolhouse.
They cannot even go out to perform their natural functions,
but have to do it like pigs in the same room. People from
many villages went on a certain day to a pilgrimage to the
monastery Potschaew. They were all arrested, locked in, and
will be sent to work. Among them there are lame, blind and
aged people”. (<span class='it'>018-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg, nevertheless, countenanced the use of force in order
to furnish slave labor to Germany and admitted his responsibility
for the “unusual and hard measures” that were employed. The
transcript of an interrogation of Rosenberg under oath on 6
October 1945, contains the following admissions:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Q. You recognized, did you not, that the quotas
set by Sauckel could not be filled by voluntary labor, and you
didn’t disapprove of the impressment of forced labor; isn’t
that right?</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. I regretted that the demands of Sauckel were so urgent
that they could not be met by a continuation of voluntary
recruitment and thus I submitted to the necessity of forced
impressment.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Q. The letters that we have already seen between you and
Sauckel, do not indicate, do they, any disagreement on your
part with the principle of recruiting labor against their
will; they indicate, as I remember, that you were opposed to
the treatment that was later accorded these workers; that
you did not oppose their initial impressment.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. That is right. In those letters I mostly discussed the
possibility of finding the least harsh methods of handling
the matter; whereas, in no way, I placed myself in opposition
to the orders that he was carrying out for the Fuehrer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, in a letter dated 21 December 1942 Rosenberg
stated:
<span class='pageno' title='888' id='Page_888'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Even if I do not close my eyes to the necessity
that the numbers demanded by the Reichs Minister for
weapons and ammunition as well as by the agricultural
economy justify unusual and hard measures, I have to ask,
due to the responsibility for the occupied Eastern Territories
which lies upon me, that in the accomplishment of
the ordered tasks such measures be excluded, the toleration
and prosecution of which will some day be held against
me, and my collaborators.” (<span class='it'>018-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Arson was used as a terror device in the Ukraine to enforce
conscription measures. One instance is reported in a document
from an official of the Rosenberg Ministry dated 29 June 1944,
enclosing a copy of a letter from Paul Raab, a district commissioner
in the territory of Wassilkow, to Rosenberg. Raab’s letter
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to a charge by the Supreme Command of the
Armed Forces I burned down a few houses in the territory
of Wassilkow/Ukr. belonging to insubordinate people
ordered for work-duty (<span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatzpflichtigen</span>). This
accusation is true.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“During the year 1942, the conscription of workers was accomplished
by way of propaganda. Only very rarely was
force necessary. Only in August 1942, measures had to be
taken against 2 families in the villages Glewenka and Salisny-Chutter,
each of which were to supply one person for
labor. Both were requested in June for the first time, but
didn’t obey although requested repeatedly. They had to be
brought up by force, but succeeded twice to escape from the
collecting camp, or when being on transport. Before the
second arrest, the fathers of both of the men were taken
into custody, to be kept as hostages and to be released only
when their sons would show up. When, after the second
escape, rearrest of both the fathers and boys was ordered,
the police patrols ordered to do so, found the houses to be
empty.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“That time I decided to take measures to show the increasingly
rebellious Ukrainian youth that our orders have to be
followed. I ordered the burning down of the houses of the
fugitives.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“After the initial successes, a passive resistance of the population
started, which finally forced me to start again on
<span class='pageno' title='889' id='Page_889'></span>
making arrests, confiscations, and transfers to labor camps.
After a while a transport of people, obliged to work, overran
the police in the railroad station in Wassilkow and escaped.
I saw again the necessity for strict measures. A few ring
leaders, which of course escaped before they were found in
Plissezkoje and in Mitnitza. After repeated attempts to get
hold of them, their houses were burned down.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“My actions against fugitive people obliged to work (<span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatzpflichtige</span>),
were always reported to district commissioner
Doehrer, in office in Wassilkow, and to the general-commissioner
(<span class='it'>Generalkommissar</span>) in Kiev. Both of them
know the circumstances and agreed with my measures, because
of their success.” (<span class='it'>254-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The village of Biloserka in the Ukraine was also the victim of
arson as has already been related in the quotation from the enclosure
to Rosenberg’s letter of 21 December 1942 to Sauckel
(<span class='it'>018-PS</span>). Additional proof of resort to arson in this village is
furnished by other correspondence originating within the Rosenberg
Ministry and dated 12 November 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“But even if Mueller had been present at the burning of
houses in connection with the national conscription in Biloserka,
this should by no means lead to the relief of Mueller
from office. It is mentioned specifically in a directive of the
Commissioner General in Lusk of 21 Sept 1942, referring to
the extreme urgency of the national conscription.</p>

<p class='noindent'>‘Estates of those who refuse to work are to be burned, their
relatives are to be arrested as hostages and to be brought
to forced labor camps.’ ” (<span class='it'>290-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The SS was directed to participate in the abduction of slave
laborers, and in the case of raids on villages or burning of villages,
to turn the entire population over for slave labor in Germany.
A secret SS order dated 19 March 1943 (<span class='it'>3012-PS</span>) states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The activity of the labor offices, resp. of recruiting commissions,
is to be supported to the greatest extent possible.
It will not be possible always to refrain from using force.
During a conference with the Chief of the Labor Commitment
Staffs, an agreement was reached stating that whatever
prisoners can be released, they should be put at the disposal
of the Commissioner of the Labor Office. When searching
(<span class='it'>Uberholung</span>) villages, resp., when it has become necessary
to burn down villages, the whole population will be put
at the disposal of the Commissioner by force.” (<span class='it'>3012-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From Shitomir, where Sauckel appealed for more workers for
<span class='pageno' title='890' id='Page_890'></span>
the Reich, the Commissioner General reported on the brutality of
the conspirators’ program, which he described as a program of
coercion and slavery. This is revealed in a secret report of a
conference between the Commissioner General of Shitomir and
Rosenberg in Winniza on 17 June 1943 (<span class='it'>265-PS</span>). The report is
dated 30 June 1943 and is signed by Leyser. It reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The symptoms created by the recruiting of workers are, no
doubt, well known to the Reichs Minister through reports and
his own observations. Therefore, I shall not report them.
It is certain that a recruitment of labor, in this sense of the
word, can hardly be spoken of. In most cases, it is nowadays
a matter of actual conscription by force.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“But as the Chief Plenipotentiary for the mobilization of
labor explained to us the gravity of the situation, we had no
other device. I consequently have authorized the commissioners
of the areas to apply the severest measures in order
to achieve the imposed quota. The deterioration of morale
in conjunction with this does not necessitate any further
proof. It is nevertheless essential to win the war on this
front too. The problem of labor mobilization cannot be
handled with gloves.” (<span class='it'>265-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These recruitment measures enslaved so many citizens of occupied
countries that entire areas were depopulated. Thus, a report
from the Chief of Main Office III with the High Command
in Minsk, dated 28 June 1943, to Ministerialdirektor Riecke, a
top official in the Rosenberg Ministry states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The recruitment of labor for the Reich, however necessary,
had disastrous effects. The recruitment measures in the last
months and weeks were absolute manhunts, which have an
irreparable political and economic effect. From White Ruthenia,
approx. 50,000 people have been obtained for the
Reich so far. Another 130,000 are to be obtained. Considering
the 2.4 million total population these figures are
impossible. * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Due to the sweeping drives (<span class='it'>Grossaktionen</span>) of the SS and
police in November 1942, about 115,000 hectar farmland is
not used, as the population is not there and the villages have
been razed. * * *” (<span class='it'>3000-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The conspirators’ policy, of permanently weakening the enemy
through the enslavement of labor and breaking up of families,
was applied in the Occupied Eastern Territories after Rosenberg’s
approval of a plan for the apprehension and deportation of 40,000
to 50,000 youths of the ages from 10 to 14. The stated purpose
<span class='pageno' title='891' id='Page_891'></span>
of this plan, approved by Rosenberg, was to prevent a reinforcement
of the enemy’s military strength and to reduce the
enemy’s biological potentialities. (<span class='it'>031-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further evidence of the Nazi conspirators’ plan to weaken
their enemies in utter disregard of the rules of International Law
is contained in a secret order issued by a rear-area Military Commandant,
to the District Commissar at Kasatin on 25 December
1943. The order provided in part that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The able-bodied male population between 15 and 65 years
of age and the cattle are to be shipped back from the district
East of the line Belilowka-Berditschen-Shitomir (places excluded).”
(<span class='it'>1702-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The program of enslavement and its accompanying measures
of brutality were not limited to Poland and the Eastern Occupied
Territories, but extended to Western Europe as well. Frenchmen,
Dutchmen, Belgians, and Italians all came to know the Nazi
slavemasters. In France these slavemasters intensified their program
in the early part of 1943 pursuant to instructions which
Speer telephoned to Sauckel from Hitler’s headquarters at eight
in the evening of 4 January 1943. These instructions are found
in a note for the files signed by Sauckel, dated 5 January 1943,
which states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. On 4 January 1943 at 8 p. m. Minister Speer telephones
from the Fuehrer’s headquarters and communicates that on
the basis of the Fuehrer’s decision, it is no longer necessary
to give special consideration to Frenchmen in the further
recruiting of specialists and helpers in France. The recruiting
can proceed with emphasis and sharpened measures.”
(<span class='it'>556-13-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To overcome the resistance to his enslavement program,
Sauckel improvised new impressment measures which were applied
in both France and Italy by his own agents and which he
himself labelled as grotesque. At a meeting of the Central Planning
Board on 1 March 1944 Sauckel stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The most abominable point made by my adversaries is their
claim that no executive had been provided within these areas
in order to recruit in a sensible manner the Frenchmen,
Belgians and Italians and to dispatch them to work. Thereupon
I even proceeded to employ and train a whole batch of
French male and female agents who for good pay just as was
done in olden times for “shanghaiing” went hunting for men
and made them drunk by using liquor as well as words, in
order to dispatch them to Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Moreover, I charged some able men with founding a special
<span class='pageno' title='892' id='Page_892'></span>
labor supply executive of our own, and this they did by
training and arming with the help of the Higher SS and
Police Fuehrer, a number of natives, but I still have to ask
the Munitions Ministry for arms for the use of these men.
For during the last year alone several dozens of very able
labor executive officers have been shot dead. All these means
I have to apply, grotesque as it sounds, to refute the allegation
there was no executive to bring labor to Germany
from these countries.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As in France, the slave hunt in Holland was accompanied by
terror and abduction. The “Statement of the Netherlands Government
in view of the Prosecution and Punishment of the German
Major War Criminals”, (<span class='it'>1726-PS</span>) contains the following account
of the deportation of Netherlands workmen to Germany:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Many big and reasonably large business concerns, especially
in the metal industry, were visited by German commissions
who appointed workmen for deportation. This combing out
of the concerns was called the “Sauckel-action”, so named
after its leader, who was charged with the appointment of
foreign workmen in Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The employers had to cancel the contracts with the appointed
workmen temporarily, and the latter were forced to
register at the labour offices, which then took care of the
deportation under supervision of German ‘<span class='it'>Fachberater</span>.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Workmen who refused (relatively few) were prosecuted by
the <span class='it'>Sicherheitsdeinst</span> (SD). If captured by this service, they
were mostly lodged for some time in one of the infamous
prisoners camps in the Netherlands and eventually put to
work in Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In this prosecution the <span class='it'>Sicherheitsdienst</span> was supported by
the German Police Service, which was connected with the
labour offices, and was composed of members of the N.S.B.
and the like.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At the end of April 1942 the deportation of working labourers
started on a grand scale. Consequently in the months
of May and June the number of deportees amounted to not
less than 22,000, resp. 24,000 of which many were metal
workers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“After that the action slackened somewhat, but in October
1942 another top was reached (2,600). After the big concerns,
the smaller ones had, in their turn, to give up their
personnel.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This changed in November 1944. The Germans then started
a ruthless campaign for manpower, passing by the labour
<span class='pageno' title='893' id='Page_893'></span>
offices. Without warning, they lined off whole quarters of
the towns, seized people in the streets or in the houses and
deported them.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In Rotterdam and Schiedam where these raids (razzia’s)
took place on 10 and 11 November, the amount of people
thus deported was estimated at 50,000 and 5,000 respectively.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In other places where the raids were held later, the numbers
were much lower, because one was forewarned by the
events. The exact figures are not known as they have never
been published by the occupants.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The people thus seized were put to work partly in the
Netherlands, partly in Germany * * *.” (<span class='it'>1726-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A document found in the OKH files furnishes further evidence
of the seizure of workers in Holland. This document contains
the partial text of a lecture delivered by a Lieutenant Haupt of
the German <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> concerning the situation of the war economy
in the Netherlands:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“There had been some difficulties with the <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span>,
i.e., during the man-catching action (<span class='it'>Menchenfang Aktion</span>)
which became very noticeable because it was unorganized and
unprepared. People were arrested in the streets and taken
out of their homes. It has been impossible to carry out a
unified release procedure in advance, because for security
reasons, the time for the action had not been previously announced.
Certificates of release, furthermore, were to some
extent not recognized by the officials who carried out the
action. Not only workers who had become available through
the stoppage of industry but also those who were employed
in our installations producing things for our immediate
need. They were apprehended or did not dare to go into the
streets. In any case it proved to be a great loss to us.

<h3>4. RESULTS OF THE SLAVE LABOR PROGRAM</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The hordes of displaced persons in Germany today reflect the
extent to which the Nazi conspirators’ labor program succeeded.
The best available Allied and German data reveal that as of January
1945 approximately 4,795,000 foreign civilian workers had
been put to work for the German war effort in the old Reich,
among them slave laborers of more than 14 different nationalities.
An affidavit executed by Edward L. Deuss, an economic
analyst, contains the following statistical summation:

<p class='pindent'>Only a small proportion of the foreign workers brought to
Germany were volunteers. At the 1 March 1944 meeting of the
Central Planning Board, Sauckel made clear the vast scale of
slavery. He stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<h3>5. CONDITIONS OF DEPORTATION AND SLAVE LABOR</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators were not satisfied to tear 5,000,000
persons from their families, their homes, and their country. They
insisted that these 5,000,000 wretches, while being deported to
Germany or after their arrival, be degraded, beaten, and permitted
to die for want of food, clothing, and adequate shelter.
Conditions of deportation are vividly described in a report to
Rosenberg concerning treatment of Ukrainian labor (<span class='it'>054-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The starosts esp. village elders are frequently corruptible,
they continue to have the skilled workers, whom they drafted,
dragged from their beds at night to be locked up in cellars
until they are shipped. Since the male and female workers
often are not given any time to pack their luggage, etc.,
many skilled workers arrive at the Collecting Center for
Skilled Workers with equipment entirely insufficient (without
shoes, only two dresses, no eating and drinking utensils,
no blankets, etc.). In particularly extreme cases new arrivals
therefore have to be sent back again immediately to get the
things most necessary for them. If people do not come along
at once, threatening and beating of skilled workers by the
above-mentioned militia is a daily occurrence and is reported
from most of the communities. In some cases women were
beaten until they could no longer march. One bad case in
particular was reported by me to the commander of the civil
police here (Colonel Samek) for severe punishment (place
Sozolinkow, district Dergatschi). The encroachments of the
starosts and the militia are of a particularly grave nature because
they usually justify themselves by claiming that all
that is done in the name of the German Armed Forces. In
reality the latter have conducted themselves throughout in
a highly understanding manner toward the skilled workers
<span class='pageno' title='896' id='Page_896'></span>
and the Ukrainian population. The same, however, can not
be said of some of the administrative agencies. To illustrate
this be it mentioned, that a woman once arrived being dressed
with barely more than a shirt.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * On the basis of reported incidents, attention must
be called to the fact that it is irresponsible to keep workers
locked in the cars for many hours so that they cannot even
take care of the calls of nature. It is evident that the people
of a transport must be given an opportunity from time to
time in order to get drinking water, to wash, and in order
to relieve themselves. Cars have been showed in which people
had made holes so that they could take care of the calls of
nature. When nearing bigger stations persons should, if
possible, relieve themselves far from these stations.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The following abuses were reported from the delousing
stations:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the women’s and girls’ shower rooms, services were
partly performed by men or men would mingle around or
even helped with the soaping; and vice versa, there were
female personnel in the men’s shower rooms; men also for
some time were taking photographs in the women’s shower
rooms. Since mainly Ukrainian peasants were transported
in the last months, as far as the female portion of these are
concerned, they were mostly of a high moral standard and
used to strict decency, they must have considered such a
treatment as a national degradation. The above-mentioned
abuses have been, according to our knowledge, settled by the
intervention of the transport commanders. The reports of
the photographing were made from Halle; the reports about
the former were made from Kiewerce. Such incidents in
complete disregard of the honor and respect of the Greater
German Reich may still occur again here or there.” (<span class='it'>054-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sick and infirm citizens of the occupied countries were taken
indiscriminately with the rest. Those who managed to survive
the trip into Germany, but who arrived too sick to work, were
returned like cattle, together with those who fell ill at work, because
they were of no further use to the Germans. The return
trip took place under the same conditions as the initial journey,
and without any kind of medical supervision. Death came to
many, and their corpses were unceremoniously dumped out of the
cars with no provision for burial. Thus, the report continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Very depressing for the morale of the skilled
<span class='pageno' title='897' id='Page_897'></span>
workers and the population is the effect of those persons
shipped back from Germany for having become disabled or
not having been fit for labor commitment from the very
beginning. Several times already transports of skilled
workers on their way to Germany have crossed returning
transports of such disabled persons and have stood on the
tracks alongside of each other for a longer period of time.
Those returning transports are insufficiently cared for.
Nothing but sick, injured of weak people, mostly 50-60 to a
car, are usually escorted by 3-4 men. There is neither sufficient
care or food. The returnees made frequently unfavourable—but
surely exaggerated—statements relative to
their treatment in Germany and on the way. As a result of
all this and of what the people could see with their own
eyes, a psychosis of fear was evoked among the specialist
workers resp. the whole transport to Germany. Several
transport leaders of the 62d and the 63d in particular reported
thereto in detail. In one case the leader of the transport
of skilled workers observed with own eyes how a person
who died of hunger was unloaded from a returning transport
on the side track. (1st Lt. Hofman of the 63rd transport
Station Darniza). Another time it was reported that 3 dead
had to be deposited by the side of the tracks on the way and
had to be left behind unburied by the escort. It is also regrettable
that these disabled persons arrive here without
any identification. According to the reports of the transport
commanders one gets the impression that these persons unable
to work are assembled, penned into the wagons and are
sent off provided only by a few men escort, and without
special care for food and medical or other attendance. The
Labor Office at the place of arrival as well as the transport
commanders confirm this impression.” (<span class='it'>054-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Mothers in childbirth shared cars with those infected with tuberculosis
or venereal diseases. Babies when born were hurled out
of windows. Dying persons lay on the bare floors of freight cars
without even the small comfort of straw. These conditions are
revealed in an interdepartmental report prepared by Dr.
Gutkelch in Rosenberg’s Ministry, dated 30 September 1942,
from which the following quotation is taken:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“How necessary this interference was is shown by the fact
that this train with returning laborers had stopped at the
same place where a train with newly recruited Eastern
laborers had stopped. Because of the corpses in the train-load
of returning laborers, a catastrophe might have been
<span class='pageno' title='898' id='Page_898'></span>
precipitated had it not been for the mediation of Mrs. Miller.
In this train women gave birth to babies who were thrown
out of the windows during the journey, people having tuberculosis
and venereal diseases rode in the same car, dying
people lay in freight cars without straw, and one of the dead
was thrown on the railway embankment. The same must
have occurred in other returning transports.” (<span class='it'>084-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Some aspects of Nazi transport were described by Sauckel
himself in a decree which he issued on 20 July 1942, (<span class='it'>2241-PS</span>).
The original decree is published in section B1a, page 48e of a
book entitled “<span class='it'>Die Beschaeftigung von auslaendischen Arbeitskraeften
in Deutschland</span>.” The decree reads, in part, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to reports of transportation commanders
(<span class='it'>Transportleiters</span>) presented to me, the special trains provided
by the German railway have frequently been in a really
deficient condition. Numerous windowpanes have been missing
in the coaches. Old French coaches without lavatories
have been partly employed so that the workers had to fit
up an emptied compartment as a lavatory. In other cases,
the coaches were not heated in winter so that the lavatories
quickly became unusable because the water system was frozen
and the flushing apparatus was therefore without water.”

<p class='pindent'>Many of the foregoing documents, it will be noted, consist of
complaints by functionaries of the Rosenberg ministry or by
others concerning the conditions under which foreign workers
were recruited and compelled to live. These documents establish
not only the facts therein recited, but also show that the Nazi
conspirators had knowledge of such conditions. Notwithstanding
their knowledge of these conditions, however, the Nazi conspirators
continued to countenance and assist in the enslavement of a
vast number of citizens of occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once within Germany, slave laborers were subjected to treatment
of an unusually brutal and degrading nature. The character
of Nazi treatment was in part made plain by the conspirator’s
own statements. Sauckel declared on one occasion:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“All the men must be fed, sheltered and treated in such a
way as to exploit them to the highest possible extent at the
lowest conceivable degree of expenditure.” (<span class='it'>016-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Force and brutality as instruments of production found a
ready adherent in Speer who, in the presence of Sauckel, said at
a meeting of the Central Planning Board:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We must also discuss the slackers. Ley has ascertained
that the sick-list decreased to one-fourth or one-fifth in factories
<span class='pageno' title='899' id='Page_899'></span>
where doctors are on the staff who are examining
the sick men. There is nothing to be said against SS and
police taking drastic steps and putting those known as
slackers into concentration camps. There is no alternative.
Let it happen several times and the news will soon go round.”
(<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At a later meeting of the Central Planning Board, Field Marshall
Milch agreed that so far as workers were concerned,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The list of the shirkers should be entrusted to Himmler’s
trustworthy hands.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Milch made particular reference to foreign workers by stating:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is therefore not possible to exploit fully all the foreigners
unless we compel them by piece-work or we have the possibility
of taking measures against foreigners who are not
doing their bit.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The policy as actually executed was even more Draconian than
the policy as planned by the conspirators. Impressed workers
were underfed and overworked. They were forced to live in
grossly overcrowded camps where they were held as virtual prisoners
and were otherwise denied adequate shelter. They were
denied adequate clothing, adequate medical care and treatment
and, as a result, suffered from many diseases and ailments. They
were generally forced to work long hours up to and beyond the
point of exhaustion. They were beaten and subjected to inhuman
indignities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An example of this mistreatment is found in the conditions
which prevailed in the Krupp factories. Foreign laborers at the
Krupp Works were given insufficient food to enable them to perform
the work required of them. A memorandum upon Krupp
stationery to Mr. Hupe, director of the Krupp Locomotive Factory
in Essen, dated 14 March 1942, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the last few days we established that the food for
the Russians employed here is so miserable, that the people
are getting weaker from day to day.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Investigations showed that single Russians are not able to
place a piece of metal for turning into position for instance,
because of lack of physical strength. The same conditions
exist at all places of work where Russians are employed.”
(<span class='it'>D-316</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The condition of foreign workers in Krupp workers camps is
described in detail in an affidavit executed in Essen, Germany, on
15 October 1945 by Dr. Wilhelm Jager, who was the senior camp
doctor. Dr. Jager makes the following statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Conditions in all these camps were extremely
<span class='pageno' title='900' id='Page_900'></span>
bad. The camps were greatly overcrowded. In some camps
there were twice as many people in a barrack as health
conditions permitted. At Kramerplatz, the inhabitants slept
in treble-tiered bunks, and in the other camps they slept in
double-tiered bunks. The health authorities prescribed a
<span class='it'>minimum</span> space between beds of 50 cm. but the bunks in
these camps were separated by a <span class='it'>maximum</span> of 20-30 cm.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The diet prescribed for the eastern workers was altogether
insufficient. They were given 1,000 calories a day less than
the minimum prescribed for any German. Moreover, while
German workers engaged in the heaviest work received
5,000 calories a day, the eastern workers in comparable jobs
received only 2,000 calories. The eastern workers were given
only 2 meals a day and their bread ration. One of these
two meals consisted of a thin, watery soup. I had no assurance
that the eastern workers, in fact, received the minimum
which was prescribed. Subsequently, in 1943, when I
undertook to inspect the food prepared by the cooks, I discovered
a number of instances in which food was withheld
from the workers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The plan for food distribution called for a small quantity
of meat per week. Only inferior meats, rejected by the veterinary
such as horse meat or tuberculin infested was permitted
for this purpose. This meat was usually cooked into a
soup.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The clothing of the eastern workers was likewise completely
inadequate. They worked and slept in the same clothing in
which they had arrived from the east. Virtually all of them
had no overcoats and were compelled, therefore, to use their
blankets as coats in cold and rainy weather. In view of the
shortage of shoes many workers were forced to go to work in
their bare feet, even in the winter. Wooden shoes were
given to some of the workers, but their quality was such as
to give the workers sore feet. Many workers preferred to
go to work in their bare feet rather than endure the suffering
caused by the wooden shoes. Apart from the wooden
shoes, no clothing of any kind was issued to the workers
until the latter part of 1943, when a single blue suit was
issued to some of them. To my knowledge, this represented
the sole issue of clothing to the workers from the time of
their arrival until the American forces entered Essen.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Sanitary conditions were exceedingly bad. At Kramerplatz,
where approximately 1,200 eastern workers were crowded
into the rooms of an old school, the sanitary conditions were
<span class='pageno' title='901' id='Page_901'></span>
atrocious in the extreme. Only 10 children’s toilets were
available for the 1,200 inhabitants. At Dechenschule, 15
children’s toilets were available for the 400-500 eastern
workers. Excretion contaminated the entire floors of these
lavatories. There were also few facilities for washing. The
supply of bandages, medicine, surgical instruments, and
other medical supplies at these camps was likewise altogether
insufficient. As a consequence, only the very worst
cases were treated.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The percentage of eastern workers who were ill was twice
as great as among the Germans. Tuberculosis was particularly
widespread among the eastern workers. The T. B. rate
among them was 4 times the normal rate of (2 percent eastern
workers, German .5 percent). At Dechenschule approximately
2½ percent of the workers suffered from open T. B.
These were all active T. B. cases. The Tartars and Kirghis
suffered most; as soon as they were overcome by this disease
they collapsed like flies. The cause was bad housing, the poor
quality and insufficient quantity of food, overwork, and insufficient
rest.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“These workers were likewise afflicted with spotted fever.
Lice the carrier of this disease, together with countless fleas,
bugs and other vermin tortured the inhabitants of these
camps. As a result of the filthy conditions of the camps
nearly all eastern workers were afflicted with skin disease.
The shortage of food also caused many cases of Hunher-Oedem,
Nephritis, and Shighakruse.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It was the general rule that workers were compelled to go
to work unless a camp doctor had prescribed that they were
unfit for work. At Seumannstrasse, Grieperstrasse, Germanistrasse,
Kapitanlehmannstrasse, and Dechenschule, there
was no daily sick call. At these camps, the doctors did not
appear for two or three days. As a consequence, workers
were forced to go to work despite illnesses.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Camp Humboldstrasse has been inhabitated by Italian prisoners
of war. After it had been destroyed by an air raid,
the Italians were removed and 600 Jewish females from
Buchenwald Concentration Camp were brought in to work
at the Krupp factories. Upon my first visit at Camp Humboldstrasse,
I found these females suffering from open festering
wounds and other diseases.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I was the first doctor they had seen for at least a fortnight.
There was no doctor in attendance at the camp. There was
<span class='pageno' title='902' id='Page_902'></span>
no medical supplies in the camp. They had no shoes and
went about in their bare feet. The sole clothing of each consisted
of a sack with holes for their arms and head. Their
hair was shorn. The camp was surrounded by barbed wire
and closely guarded by SS guards.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The amount of food in the camp was extremely meagre and
of very poor quality. The houses in which they lived consisted
of the ruins of former barracks and they afforded no
shelter against rain and other weather conditions. I reported
to my superiors that the guards lived and slept outside their
barracks as one could not enter them without being attacked
by 10, 20 and up to 50 fleas. One camp doctor employed by
me refused to enter the camp again after he had been bitten
very badly. I visited this camp with a Mr. Green on two
occasions and both times we left the camp badly bitten. We
had great difficulty in getting rid of the fleas and insects
which had attacked us. As a result of this attack by insects
of this camp, I got large boils on my arms and the rest of
my body. I asked my superiors at the Krupp works to undertake
the necessary steps to de-louse the camp so as to put
an end to this unbearable, vermin-infested condition. Despite
this report, I did not find any improvement in sanitary conditions
at the camp on my second visit a fortnight later.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“When foreign workers finally became too sick to work or
were completely disabled they were returned to the Labour
Exchange in Essen and from there, they were sent to a camp
at Friedrichsfeld. Among persons who were returned over
to the Labour Exchange were aggravated cases of tuberculosis,
malaria, neurosis, career which could not be treated by
operation, old age, and general feebleness. I know nothing
about conditions at this camp because I have never visited it.
I only know that it was a place to which workers who no
longer of any use to Krupp were sent.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“My colleagues and I reported all of the foregoing matters
to Mr. Ihh, Director of Friedrich Krupp A. G. Dr. Wiels,
personal physician of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach,
Senior Camp Leader Kupke, and at all times to the
health department. Moreover, I know that these gentlemen
personally visited the camps.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“(Signed) Dr. Wilhelm Jager.” (<span class='it'>D-288</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The conditions just described were not confined to the Krupp
factories but existed throughout Germany. A report of the Polish
Main Committee to the Administration of the Government-General
of Poland, dated 17 May 1944, describes in similar terms the
situation of Polish workers in Germany (<span class='it'>R-103</span>):
<span class='pageno' title='903' id='Page_903'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The cleanliness of many overcrowded camp rooms is contrary
to the most elementary requirements. Often there is
no opportunity to obtain warm water for washing; therefore
the cleanest parents are unable to maintain even the most
primitive standard of hygiene for their children or often
even to wash their only set of linen. A consequence of this
is the spreading of scabies which cannot be eradicated
* * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We receive imploring letters from the camps of Eastern
workers and their prolific families beseeching us for food.
The quantity and quality of camp rations mentioned therein—the
so-called fourth grade of rations—is absolutely insufficient
to maintain the energies spent in heavy work. 3.5 kg.
of bread weekly and a thin soup at lunch time, cooked with
swedes or other vegetables without any meat or fat, with a
meager addition of potatoes now and then is a hunger ration
for a heavy worker.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Sometimes punishment consists of starvation which is inflicted,
i.e. for refusal to wear the badge, ‘East’. Such punishment
has the result that workers faint at work (Klosterteich
Camp, Gruenheim, Saxony). The consequence is complete
exhaustion, an ailing state of health and tuberculosis.
The spreading of tuberculosis among the Polish factory
workers is a result of the deficient food rations meted out
in the community camps because energy spent in heavy work
cannot be replaced * * *.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The call for help which reaches us, brings to light starvation
and hunger, severe stomach intestinal trouble especially
in the case of children resulting from the insufficiency of
food which does not take into consideration the needs of
children. Proper medical treatment or care for the sick are
not available in the mass camps. * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In addition to these bad conditions, there is lack of systematic
occupation for and supervision of these hosts of children
which affects the life of prolific families in the camps. The
children, left to themselves without schooling or religious
care, must run wild and grow up illiterate. Idleness in rough
surroundings may and will create unwanted results in these
children * * *. An indication of the awful conditions
this may lead to is given by the fact that in the camps for
Eastern workers—(camp for Eastern workers, ‘Waldlust’,
Post Office Lauf, Pegnitz)—there are cases of 8-year old
delicate and undernourished children put to forced labor and
perishing from such treatment.
<span class='pageno' title='904' id='Page_904'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“The fact that these bad conditions dangerously affect the
state of health and the vitality of the workers is proved by
the many cases of tuberculosis found in very young people
returning from the Reich to the General-Government as unfit
for work. Their state of health is usually so bad that
recovery is out of the question. The reason is that a state
of exhaustion resulting from overwork and a starvation diet
is not recognized as an ailment until the illness betrays itself
by high fever and fainting spells.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Although some hostels for unfit workers have been provided
as a precautionary measure, one can only go there when
recovery may no longer be expected—(Neumarkt in Bavaria).
Even there the incurables waste away slowly, and
nothing is done even to alleviate the state of the sick by suitable
food and medicines. There are children there with tuberculosis
whose cure would not be hopeless and men in
their prime who if sent home in time to their families in
rural districts, might still be able to recover.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“No less suffering is caused by the separation of families
when wives and mothers of small children are away from
their families and sent to the Reich for forced labor.* * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If, under these bad conditions, there is no moral support
such as is normally based on regular family life, then at
least such moral support which the religious feelings of the
Polish population require should be maintained and increased.
The elimination of religious services, religious practice
and religious care from the life of the Polish workers,
the prohibition of church attendance at a time when there
is a religious service for other people and other measures
show a certain contempt for the influence of religion on the
feelings and opinions of the workers.” (<span class='it'>R-103</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Particularly harsh and brutal treatment was reserved for
workers imported from the conquered Eastern territories. They
lived in bondage, were quartered in stables with animals, and
were denied the right of worship and the pleasures of human
society. A document entitled “Directives on the Treatment of
Foreign Farmworkers of Polish Nationality”, issued by the Minister
for Finance and Economy of Baden on 6 March 1941, describes
this treatment (<span class='it'>EC-68</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The agencies of the Reich Food Administration (<span class='it'>Reichsnaehrstand</span>)
State Peasant Association of Baden have received
the result of the negotiations with the Higher SS and
Police Officer in Stuttgart on 14 February 1941, with great
<span class='pageno' title='905' id='Page_905'></span>
satisfaction. Appropriate memoranda have already been
turned over to the District Peasants’ Associations. Below, I
promulgate the individual regulations, as they have been laid
down during the conference and how they are now to be applied
accordingly:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Fundamentally, farmworkers of Polish nationality no
longer have the right to complain, and thus no complaints
may be accepted any more by any official agency.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The farmworkers of Polish nationality may not leave
the localities in which they are employed, and have a curfew
from 1 October to 31 March from 2000 hours to 0600 hours,
and from 1 April to 30 September from 2100 hours to 0500
hours.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The use of bicycles is strictly prohibited. Exceptions
are possible for riding to the place of work in the field if a
relative of the employer or the employer himself is present.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. The visit of churches, regardless of faith, is strictly prohibited,
even when there is no service in progress. Individual
spiritual care by clergymen outside of the church is
permitted.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. Visits to theaters, motion pictures or other cultural entertainment
are strictly prohibited for farmworkers of Polish
nationality.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“6. The visit of restaurants is strictly prohibited to farmworkers
of Polish nationality except for one restaurant in
the village, which will be selected by the Rural Councillor’s
office (<span class='it'>Landratsamt</span>), and then only one day per week. The
day, which is determined as the day to visit the restaurant,
will also be determined by the <span class='it'>Landratsamt</span>. This regulation
does not change the curfew regulation mentioned above
under No. 2.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“7. Sexual intercourse with women and girls is strictly prohibited,
and where it is established, it must be reported.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“8. Gatherings of farmworkers of Polish nationality after
work is prohibited, whether it is on other farms, in the
stables, or in the living quarters of the Poles.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“9. The use of railroads, buses or other public conveyances
by farmworkers of Polish nationality is prohibited.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“10. Permits to leave the village may only be granted in
very exceptional cases, by the local police authority (Mayor’s
office). However, in no case may it be granted if he wants
to visit a public agency on his own, whether it is a labor
<span class='pageno' title='906' id='Page_906'></span>
office or the District Peasants Association or whether he
wants to change his place of employment.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“11. Arbitrary change of employment is strictly prohibited.
The farmworkers of Polish nationality have to work daily so
long as the interests of the enterprise demands it, and as it
is demanded by the employer. There are no time limits to
the working time.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“12. Every employer has the right to give corporal punishment
toward farmworkers of Polish nationality, if instructions
and good words fail. The employer may not be held
accountable in any such case by an official agency.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“13. Farmworkers of Polish nationality should, if possible,
be removed from the community of the home and they can
be quartered in stables, etc. No remorse whatever should
restrict such action.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“14. Report to the authorities is compulsory in all cases,
when crimes have been committed by farmworkers of Polish
nationality, which are to sabotage the enterprise or slow
down work, for instance unwillingness to work, impertinent
behavior; it is compulsory even in minor cases. An employer,
who loses his Pole who must serve a longer prison
sentence because of such a compulsory report, will receive
another Pole from the competent labor office on request with
preference.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“15. In all other cases, only the state police is still competent.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For the employer himself, severe punishment is contemplated
if it is established that the necessary distance from
farmworkers of Polish nationality has not been kept. The
same applies to women and girls. Extra rations are strictly
prohibited. Noncompliance to the Reich tariffs for farmworkers
of Polish nationality will be punished by the competent
labor office by the taking away of the worker.” (<span class='it'>EC-68</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The women of the conquered territories were led away against
their will to serve as domestics. Sauckel described this program
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * In order to relieve considerably the German
housewife, especially the mother with many children and the
extremely busy farmwoman, and in order to avoid any further
danger to their health, the Fuehrer also charged me
with procurement of 400,000-500,000 selected, healthy and
strong girls from the territories of the East for Germany.”
(<span class='it'>016-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='907' id='Page_907'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Once captured, these Eastern women, by order of Sauckel,
were bound to the household to which they were assigned, permitted
at the most three hours of freedom a week, and denied the
right to return to their homes. The decree issued by Sauckel
containing instructions for housewives concerning Eastern household
workers, provides in part, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * There is no claim for free time. Female domestic
workers from the East may, on principle, leave the household
only to take care of domestic tasks. As a reward for
good work, however, they may be given the opportunity to
stay outside the home without work for 3 hours once a week.
This leave must end with the onset of darkness, at the latest
at 20:00 hours. It is prohibited to enter restaurants, movies,
or other theatres and similar establishments provided for
German or foreign workers. Attending church is also prohibited.
Special events may be arranged for Eastern domestics
in urban homes by the German Workers’ Front, for
Eastern domestics in rural homes by the Reich Food Administration
with the German Women’s League (<span class='it'>Deutsches
Frauenwerk</span>). Outside the home, the Eastern domestic must
always carry her work card as a personal pass.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“10. Vacations, Return to Homes.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Vacations are not granted as yet. The recruiting of Eastern
domestics is for an indefinite period.” (<span class='it'>3044-B-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At all times the shadow of the Gestapo and the concentration
camp hovered over the enslaved workers. As with the other
major programs of the Nazi conspirators, Himmler’s black-shirted
SS formations were the instruments employed for enforcement.
A secret order dated 20 February 1942, issued by
Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler to SD and security police officers
spells out the violence which was applied against the Eastern
workers. (<span class='it'>3040-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“III. Combatting violations against discipline.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(1) According to the equal status of the manpower from
the original Soviet Russian territory with prisoners of war,
a strict discipline must be exercised in the quarters and at
the working place. Violations against discipline, including
work refusal and loafing at work, will be fought exclusively
by the secret State police. The smaller cases will be settled
by the leader of the guard according to instruction of the
State police administration offices with measures as provided
for in the enclosure. To break acute resistance, the guards
shall be permitted to use also physical power against the
manpower. But this may be done only for a cogent cause.
<span class='pageno' title='908' id='Page_908'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>The manpower should always be informed about the fact
that they will be treated decently when conducting themselves
with discipline and accomplishing good work.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(2) In severe cases, that is in such cases where the measures
at the disposal of the leader of the guard do not suffice, the
State police office has to act with its means. Accordingly,
they will be treated, as a rule, only with strict measures, that
is with transfer to a concentration camp or with special
treatment.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(3) The transfer to a concentration camp is done in the
usual manner.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(4) In especially severe cases special treatment is to be requested
at the Reich Security Main Office, stating personnel
data and the exact history of the act.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(5) Special treatment is hanging. It should not take place
in the immediate vicinity of the camp. A certain number of
manpower from the original Soviet Russian territory should
attend the special treatment; at that time they are warned
about the circumstances which led to this special treatment.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(6) Should special treatment be required within the camp
for exceptional reasons of camp discipline, this is also to be
requested.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“VI. Sexual Intercourse.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Sexual intercourse is forbidden to the manpower of the
original Soviet Russian territory. By means of their closely
confined quarters they have no opportunity for it. Should
sexual intercourse be exercised nevertheless—especially
among the individually employed manpower on the farms—the
following is directed:</p>

<h3>6. USE OF SLAVE LABOR IN GERMAN WAR INDUSTRIES</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The primary purpose of the slave labor program was to compel
the people of the occupied countries to work for the German war
economy. The decree appointing Sauckel Plenipotentiary-General
for Manpower declares the purpose of the appointment to be
to facilitate acquisition of the manpower required for German
war industries, and in particular the armaments industry, by
centralizing under Sauckel responsibility for the recruitment and
allocation of foreign labor and prisoners of war in these industries
(<span class='it'>1666-PS</span>). This decree, signed by Hitler, Lammers and
Keitel, and dated 21 March 1942, provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In order to secure the manpower requisite for the war industries
as a whole, and particularly for armaments, it is
necessary that the utilization of all available manpower, including
that of workers recruited (<span class='it'>angeworbenen</span>) abroad
and of prisoners of war, should be subject to a uniform control,
directed in a manner appropriate to the requirements
of war industry, and further that all still incompletely utilized
manpower in the Greater German Reich, including the
Protectorate, and in the General Government and in the occupied
territories should be mobilized.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Reichsstatthalter</span> and <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> Fritz Sauckel will carry out
this task within the framework of the Four Year Plan, as
Plenipotentiary General, for the utilization of labor. In that
capacity he will be directly responsible to the Commissioner
for the Four Year Plan.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Section III (Wages) and Section V (Utilization of labor) of
the Reich Labor Ministry, together with their subordinate
authorities, will be placed at the disposal of the Plenipotentiary
General for the accomplishment of his task.” (<span class='it'>1666-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel’s success can be gauged from a letter he wrote to Hitler
on 15 April 1943, containing a report on one year’s activities:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. After one year’s activity as Plenipotentiary for the Direction
of Labor, I can report that 3,638,056 new foreign
workers were given to the German war economy from 1 April
of last year to 31 March this year.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The 3,638,056 are distributed amongst the following
branches of the German war economy</p>

<p class='pindent'>Armament—1,568,801.” (<span class='it'>407-VI-PS</span>)</p>

</div>
<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='910' id='Page_910'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Further evidence of this use of enslaved foreign labor is found
in a report of a meeting of the Central Planning Board on 16
February 1944, during which Field Marshal Milch stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The armament industry employs foreign workmen to a large
extent; according to the latest figures—40 percent.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, according to tabulations of Speer’s Ministry, as of
31 December 1944 approximately two million civilian foreign
workers were employed directly in the manufacture of armaments
and munitions (end products or components). (<span class='it'>2520-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel, Speer, and Keitel also succeeded in forcing foreign
labor to construct military fortifications. Thus, citizens of
France, Holland, and Belgium were compelled against their will
to engage in the construction of the “Atlantic Wall”. Hitler, in
an order dated 8 September 1942, initialed by Keitel, decreed
that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The extensive coastal fortifications which I have ordered to
be erected in the area of Army Group West make it necessary
that in the occupied territory all available workers
should be committed and should give the fullest extent of
their productive capacities. The previous allotment of domestic
workers is insufficient. In order to increase it, I order the
introduction of compulsory labor and the prohibition of
changing the place of employment without permission of the
authorities in the occupied territories. Furthermore, the
distribution of food and clothing ration cards to those subject
to labor draft should in the future depend on the possession
of a certificate of employment. Refusal to accept an assigned
job, as well as abandoning the place of work without the consent
of the authorities in charge, will result in the withdrawal
of the food and clothing ration cards. The GBA
(Deputy General for <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span>) in agreement with the
military commander as well as the Reich Commissar, will
issue the corresponding decrees for execution.” (<span class='it'>556-2-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel boasted to Hitler concerning the contribution of the
forced labor program to the construction of the Atlantic Wall by
Speer’s Organization Todt (OT). In a letter to Hitler dated 17
May 1943, Sauckel wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * In addition to the labor allotted to the total German
economy by the Arbeitseinsatz since I took office, the
Organization Todt was supplied with new labor continually.
* * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Thus, the Arbeitseinsatz has done everything to help make
possible the completion of the Atlantic Wall.” (<span class='it'>407-VIII-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Similarly, Russian civilians were forced into labor battalions
<span class='pageno' title='911' id='Page_911'></span>
and compelled to build fortifications to be used against their own
countrymen. A memorandum of the Rosenberg Ministry states
that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * men and women in the theaters of operations have
been and will be conscripted into labor battalions to be used
in the construction of fortifications * * *.” (<span class='it'>031-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, the Nazi conspirators compelled Prisoners of War
to engage in operations of war against their own country and its
Allies. At a meeting of the Central Planning Board held on February
19, 1943, attended by Speer, Sauckel, and Field Marshal
Milch, the following conversation occurred:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Sauckel: If any prisoners are taken, there, they will be
needed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Milch: We have made a request for an order that a certain
percentage of men in the antiaircraft artillery must be Russians.
50,000 will be taken altogether; 30,000 are already
employed as gunners. This is an amusing thing that Russians
must work the guns.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(At this point a series of official German Army photographs
were offered in evidence. The first one shows Russian Prisoners
of War acting as ammunition bearers during the attack upon
Tschudowo. The second group consists of a series of official German
Army photographs taken in July and August 1941 showing
Russian prisoners of war in Latvia and the Ukraine being compelled
to load and unload ammunition trains and trucks and being
required to stack ammunition.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This use of prisoners of war was in flagrant disregard of the
rules of international law, particularly Article 6 of the Regulations
annexed to Hague Convention Number 4 of 1907, which
provides that the tasks of prisoners of war shall have no connection
with the operations of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators made extensive use of prisoners of war
not only in active operations of war but also in the German
armament industry. A secret letter from the Reichminister of
Labor to the Presidents of the Regional Labor Exchange Offices
refers to an order of Goering to the effect that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Upon personal order of the Reich Marshal, 100,000 men
are to be taken from among the French PWs not yet employed
in armament industry, and are to be assigned to the
armament industry (airplanes industry). Gaps in manpower
supply resulting therefrom will be filled by Soviet PWs. The
transfer of the above-named French PWs is to be accomplished
by 1 October.” (<span class='it'>3005-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A similar policy was followed with respect to Russian prisoners
<span class='pageno' title='912' id='Page_912'></span>
of war. In a secret memorandum issued from Hitler’s headquarters
on 31 October 1942, Keitel directed the execution of
Hitler’s order to use such prisoners in the German war economy
(<span class='it'>EC-194</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The lack of workers is becoming an increasingly dangerous
hindrance for the future German war and armament industry.
The expected relief through discharges from the armed
forces is uncertain as to the extent and date; however, its
possible extent will by no means correspond to expectations
and requirements in view of the great demand.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer has now ordered that even the working power
of the Russian prisoner of war should be utilized to a large
extent by large scale assignment for the requirements of the
war industry. The prerequisite for production is adequate
nourishment. Also very small wages are to be planned for
the most modest supply with a few consumers’ goods (<span class='it'>Genussmittel</span>)
for every day’s life, eventual rewards for production.”</p>

of skilled workers.” (<span class='it'>EC-194</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering, at a conference at the Air Ministry on 7 November
1941, also discussed the use of prisoners of war in the armament
<span class='pageno' title='913' id='Page_913'></span>
industry. The Top Secret notes on Goering’s instructions as to
the employment and treatment of prisoners of war in many
phases of the German war industry read as follows (<span class='it'>1206-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer’s point of view as to employment of prisoners
of war in war industries has changed basically. So far a
total of 5 million prisoners of war—employed so far 2
million.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For 4) <span class='it'>In the Interior and the Protectorate</span>, it would be
ideal if entire factories could be manned by Russian PW’s

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> <span class='it'>At the top coal mining industry.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Speer also sponsored and applied the policy of using prisoners
of war in the armament industry. In a speech to the Nazi Gauleiters
on 24 February 1942, Speer said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I therefore proposed to the Fuehrer at the end of December
that all my labor force, including specialists be released
for mass employment in the East. Subsequently the remaining
PW’s, about 10,000 were put at disposal of the armaments
industry by me.” (<span class='it'>1435-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Speer also reported at the 36th meeting of the Central Planning
Board, held on 22 April 1943, that only 30% of the Russian
prisoners of war were engaged in the armament industry. This
he found unsatisfactory. Speer continued:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“There is a specified statement showing in what sectors the
Russian PW’s have been distributed, and this statement is
quite interesting. It shows that the armaments industry
only received 30%. I always complained about this.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The 90,000 Russian PW’s employed in the whole of the armaments
industry are for the greatest part skilled men.”
(<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel, who was appointed Plenipotentiary General for the
utilization of labor for the express purpose, among others, of integrating
prisoners of war into the German war industry, made
it plain that prisoners of war were to be compelled to serve the
German armament industry. His labor mobilization program
contains the following statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“All prisoners of war, from the territories of the West as
well as of the East, actually in Germany, must be completely
incorporated into the German armament and nutrition industries.
Their production must be brought to the highest
possible level.” (<span class='it'>016-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>7. THE CONCENTRATION CAMP PROGRAM OF EXTERMINATION THROUGH WORK</h3>

<p class='pindent'>A special Nazi program combined the brutality and the purposes
of the slave labor program with those of the concentration
camp. The Nazis placed Allied nationals in concentration camps
and forced them, along with the other inmates of the concentration
<span class='pageno' title='915' id='Page_915'></span>
camps, to work in the armaments industry under conditions
designed to exterminate them. This was the Nazi program of
extermination through work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The program was initiated in the spring of 1942. It was outlined
as follows in a letter to Himmler, dated 30 April 1942, from
his subordinate Pohl, SS Obergruppenfuehrer and General of the
Waffen SS:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today I report about the present situation of the concentration
camps and about measures I have taken to carry out
your order of the 3rd March 1942.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The war has brought about a marked change in the structure
of the concentration camps and has changed their duties
with regard to the employment of the prisoners. The custody
of prisoners for the sole reasons of security, education,
or prevention is no longer the main consideration. The mobilization
of all prisoners who are fit for work for purposes
of the war now, and for purposes of construction in the
forthcoming peace, come to the foreground more and more.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. From this knowledge some necessary measures result
with the aim to transform the concentration camps into organizations
more suitable for the economic tasks, whilst
they were formerly merely politically interested.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. For this reason I have gathered together all the leaders
of the former inspectorate of Concentration Camps, all Camp
Commanders, and all managers and supervisors of work on
the 23rd and 24th of April, 1942; I have explained personally
to them this new development. I have compiled in the
order attached the main essentials, which have to be brought
into effect with the utmost urgency if the commencement of
work for purposes of the armament industry is not to be delayed.”
(<span class='it'>R-129</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The order referred to in paragraph 3 above set the framework
for a program of relentless exploitation, providing in part as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“4. The camp commander alone is responsible for the employment
of the labor available. This employment must be,
in the true meaning of the word, exhaustive, in order to obtain
the greatest measure of performance. Work is allotted
by the Chief of the Department D centrally and alone. The
camp-commanders themselves may not accept on their own
initiative work offered by third parties and may not negotiate
about it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. There is no limit to working hours. Their duration depends
<span class='pageno' title='916' id='Page_916'></span>
on the kind of working establishments in the camps
and the kind of work to be done. They are fixed by the camp
commanders alone.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“6. Any circumstances which may result in a shortening of
working hours (e.g. meals, roll-calls) have therefore to be
restricted to the minimum which cannot be condensed any
more. It is forbidden to allow long walks to the place of
working and noon intervals only for eating purposes.” (<span class='it'>R-129</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This armaments production program was not merely a
scheme for mobilizing the manpower potential of the camps. It
was directly integrated into the larger Nazi program of extermination.
A memorandum of an agreement between Himmler
and the Minister of Justice, Thierack sets for the Nazi objective
of extermination through work:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * 2. The delivery of anti-social elements from the execution
of their sentence to the Reich Fuehrer of SS to be
worked to death. Persons under protective arrest, Jews, Gypsies,
Russians and Ukrainians, Poles with more than 3-year
sentences, Czechs and Germans with more than 8-year sentences,
according to the decision of the Reich Minister for
Justice. First of all the worst anti-social elements amongst
those just mentioned are to be handed over. I shall inform
the Fuehrer of this through Reichsleiter Bormann.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“14. It is agreed that, in consideration of the intended aims
of the Government for the clearing up of the Eastern problems,
in future Jews, Poles, Gypsies, Russians and Ukrainians
are no longer to be judged by the ordinary courts, so
far as punishable offenses are concerned, but are to be dealt
with by the Reich Fuehrer of SS. This does not apply to
civil lawsuits, nor to Poles whose names are announced or
entered in the German Racial Lists.” (<span class='it'>654-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In September, 1942, Speer arranged to bring this new source
of labor within his jurisdiction. Speer convinced Hitler that significant
production could be obtained only if the concentration
camp prisoners were employed in factories under the technical
control of the Speer Ministry instead of in camps. In fact, without
Speer’s cooperation, it would have been difficult to utilize
the prisoners on any large scale for war production since he
would not allocate to Himmler the machine tools and other necessary
equipment. Accordingly, it was agreed that the prisoners
were to be exploited in factories under Speer’s control. To compensate
Himmler for surrendering this jurisdiction to Speer,
<span class='pageno' title='917' id='Page_917'></span>
Speer proposed, and Hitler agreed, that Himmler would receive
a share of the armaments output, fixed in relation to the man
hours contributed by his prisoners. The minutes of Speer’s conference
with Hitler on 20, 21, 22 September 1942, are as follows
(<span class='it'>R-124</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * I pointed out to the Fuehrer that, apart from an
insignificant amount of work, no possibility exists of organizing
armament production in the concentration camps, because:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. the machine tools required are missing,</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. there are no suitable premises.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Both these assets would be available in the armaments industry,
if use could be made of them by a second shift.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer agrees to my proposal, that the numerous
factories set up outside towns for ARP reasons, should release
their workers for supplementing the second shift in
town factories and should in return be supplied with labor
from the concentration camps—also two shifts.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I pointed out to the Fuehrer the difficulties which I expect
to encounter if Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler should be able, as
he requests, to exercise authoritative influence over these
factories. The Fuehrer, too, does not consider such an influence
necessary.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer however agrees that Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler
should draw advantages from making his prisoners
available; he should get equipment for his division.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I suggest to give him a share in kind (war equipment) in
ratio to the working hours done by his prisoners. A 3-5%
share is discussed, the equipment also being calculated according
to working hours. The Fuehrer would agree to such
a solution.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer is prepared to order the additional delivery of
this equipment and weapons to the SS, according to a list
submitted to him.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After a demand for concentration camp labor had been created,
and a mechanism set up by Speer for exploiting this labor in
armament factories, measures were evolved for increasing the
supply of victims for extermination through work. A steady
flow was assured by the agreement between Himmler and the
Minister of Justice mentioned above. This was implemented by
such programs as the following, expressed in Sauckel’s letter of
26 November 1942 to Presidents of Landes Employment Offices
regarding the program for the evacuation of Poles from the Lublin
district:
<span class='pageno' title='918' id='Page_918'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Poles who are to be evacuated as a result of this measure
will be put into concentration camps and put to work
where they are criminal or asocial elements.” (<span class='it'>L-61</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>General measures were supplemented by special drives for persons
who would not otherwise have been sent to concentration
camps. For example, for “reasons of war necessity” Himmler
ordered on 17 December 1942 that at least 35,000 prisoners qualified
for work should be transferred immediately to concentration
camps, (<span class='it'>1063-D-PS</span>). The order provided that:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For reasons of war necessity not to be discussed further
here, the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police
on 14 December 1942 has ordered that until the end of January
1943, at least 35,000 prisoners qualified for work, are
to be sent to the concentration camps. In order to reach this
number, the following measures are required:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. As of now (so far until 1 Feb. 1943) all eastern workers
or such foreign workers who have been fugitives, or who
have broken contracts, and who do not belong to allied,
friendly or neutral States are to be brought by the quickest
means to the nearest concentration camps * * *.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The commanders and the commandants of the security
police and the security service, and the chiefs of the State
Police Headquarters will check immediately on the basis of a
close and strict ruling</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>a.</span> the prisons</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>b.</span> the labor reformatory camps</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All prisoners qualified for work, if it is essentially and humanly
possible, will be committed at once to the nearest concentration
camp, according to the following instructions, for
instance also if penal procedures were to be established in
the near future. Only such prisoners who in the interest of
investigation procedures are to remain absolutely in solitary
confinement can be left there.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Every single laborer counts!</span>” (<span class='it'>1063-D-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Measures were also adopted to insure that extermination
through work was practiced with maximum efficiency. Subsidiary
concentration camps were established near important war
plants. Speer has admitted that he personally toured Upper
Austria and selected sites for concentration camps near various
munitions factories in the area. This admission appears in the
transcript of an interrogation of Speer under oath on 18 October
1945, in which Speer stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The fact that we were anxious to use workers from concentration
camps in factories and to establish small concentration
<span class='pageno' title='919' id='Page_919'></span>
camps near the factories in order to use the manpower
that was available there was a general fact. But it did not
only come up in connection with this trip.” [i.e. Speer’s trip
to Austria]. (<span class='it'>3720-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering endorsed this use of concentration camp labor and
asked for more. In a teletype which Goering sent to Himmler
on 14 February 1944, he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“At the same time I ask you to put at my disposal as great
a number of concentration camp (KZ-) convicts as possible
for air armament, as this kind of manpower proved to be
very useful according to previous experience. The situation
of the air war makes subterranean transfer of industry necessary.
For work of this kind concentration camp (KZ-)
convicts can be especially well concentrated at work and in
the camp.” (<span class='it'>1584-I-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Speer subsequently assumed responsibility for this program,
and Hitler promised Speer that if the necessary labor for the program
could not be obtained, a hundred thousand Hungarian Jews
would be brought in by the SS. Speer’s record of conferences
with Hitler on April 6 and 7, 1944, contain the following quotation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Suggested to the Fuehrer that, due to lack of
builders and equipment, the second big building project
should not be set up in German territory, but in close vicinity
to the border on suitable soil (preferable on gravel base
and with transport facilities) on French, Belgian or Dutch
territory. The Fuehrer agrees to this suggestion if the works
could be set up behind a fortified zone. For the suggestion
of setting this plant up in French territory speaks mainly the
fact that it would be much easier to procure the necessary
workers. Nevertheless, the Fuehrer asks an attempt be made
to set up the second works in a safer area, namely in the
Protectorate. If it should prove impossible there, too, to get
hold of the necessary workers, the Fuehrer himself will contact
the Reichsfuehrer SS and will give an order that the required
100,000 men are to be made available by bringing in
Jews from Hungary. Stressing the fact that the building
organization of the <span class='it'>Industriegemeinschaft Schlesien Silesia</span>
was a failure, the Fuehrer demands that these works must
be built by the O.T. exclusively and that the workers should
be made available by the Reichsfuehrer SS. He wants to
hold a meeting shortly in order to discuss details with all the
men concerned.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>
<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='920' id='Page_920'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The character of the treatment inflicted on Allied nationals and
other victims of concentration camps while they were being
worked to death is described in an official report prepared by a
U.S. Congressional Committee which inspected the liberated
camps at the request of General Eisenhower (<span class='it'>L-159</span>). The report
states in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The treatment accorded to these prisoners in the
concentration camps was generally as follows: They were
herded together in some wooden barracks not large enough
for one-tenth of their number. They were forced to sleep on
wooden frames covered with wooden boards in tiers of two,
three and even four, sometimes with no covering, sometimes
with a bundle of dirty rags serving both as pallet and
coverlet.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Their food consisted generally of about one-half of a pound
of black bread per day and a bowl of watery soup for noon
and night, and not always that. Owing to the great numbers
crowded into a small space and to the lack of adequate
sustenance, lice and vermin multiplied, disease became rampant,
and those who did not soon die of disease or torture
began the long, slow process of starvation. Notwithstanding
the deliberate starvation program inflicted upon these
prisoners by lack of adequate food, we found no evidence
that the people of Germany as a whole were suffering from
any lack of sufficient food or clothing. The contrast was so
striking that the only conclusion which we could reach was
that the starvation of the inmates of these camps was
deliberate.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Upon entrance into these camps, newcomers were forced
to work either at an adjoining war factory or were placed
‘in commando’ on various jobs in the vicinity, being returned
each night to their stall in the barracks. Generally a German
criminal was placed in charge of each ‘block’ or shed in which
the prisoners slept. Periodically he would choose the one
prisoner of his block who seemed the most alert or intelligent
or showed the most leadership qualities. These would report
to the guards’ room and would never be heard from again.
The generally-accepted belief of the prisoners was that these
were shot or gassed or hanged and then cremated. A refusal
to work or an infraction of the rules usually meant
flogging and other types of torture, such as having the fingernails
pulled out, and in each case usually ended in death
after extensive suffering. The policies herein described constituted
<span class='pageno' title='921' id='Page_921'></span>
a calculated and diabolical program of planned torture
and extermination on the part of those who were in
control of the German Government * * *.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On the whole, we found this camp to have been operated
and administered much in the same manner as Buchenwald
had been operated and managed. When the efficiency of the
workers decreased as a result of the conditions under which
they were required to live, their rations were decreased as
punishment. This brought about a vicious circle in which
the weak became weaker and were ultimately exterminated.”
(<span class='it'>L-159</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the cycle of work, torture, starvation and death for
concentration camp labor—labor which Goering, while requesting
that more of it be placed at his disposal, said had proved very
useful; labor which Speer was “anxious” to use in the factories under his control.</p>

<h3>8. THE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF SAUCKEL</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel bears special responsibility for the Nazi slave labor
program and the manner in which it was executed. Sauckel was
appointed as Plenipotentiary General for Manpower because he
was an old and trusted Nazi. He has certified, on 17 November
1945, that he held the following positions:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Member of <span class='it'>Nationalsozialistischen Deutschen Arbeiterpartei</span>
(1925-1945). (Member of National Socialist German

<p class='noindent'>11. General Plenipotentiary for Labor Allocation (<span class='it'>Generalbevollmaechtigter
fuer den Arbeitseinsatz</span>) (21 March 1942-1945).” (<span class='it'>2974-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel’s official responsibilities are borne out by other evidence.
His appointment as Plenipotentiary-General for Manpower
was effected by a decree of 21 March 1942 signed by Hitler, Lammers,
and Keitel. By that decree (<span class='it'>1666-PS</span>) Sauckel was given
authority as well as responsibility subordinate only to that of
Hitler and Goering for all matters relating to recruitment, allocation,
and handling of foreign and domestic manpower. Goering,
to whom Sauckel was directly responsible, abolished the recruitment
and allocation agencies for the Four Year Plan, delegated
their powers to Sauckel and placed his far-reaching authority, as
deputy for the Four Year Plan, at Sauckel’s disposal. This was
the result of Goering’s decree dated 27 March 1942 (<span class='it'>1666-PS</span>)
and providing as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In pursuance of the Fuehrer’s Decree of 21 March 1942
(RGBl I, 179), I decree as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. My manpower sections (<span class='it'>Geschaeftsgruppen Arbeitseinsatz</span>)
are hereby abolished (circular letter of 22 Oct 1936/St
M. Dev. 265). Their duties (recruitment and allocation of
manpower, regulations for labor conditions (<span class='it'>Arbeitsbedingungen</span>))
are taken over by the Plenipotentiary General for
Arbeitseinsatz, who is directly under me.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The Plenipotentiary General for <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span> will be
responsible for regulating the conditions of labor (wage
policy) employed in the Reich Territory, having regard to
the requirements of <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span>.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. The Plenipotentiary General for <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span> is part
of the Four Year Plan. In cases where new legislation is required,
or existing laws required to be modified, he will submit
appropriate proposals to me.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. The Plenipotentiary General for <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span> will have
at his disposal for the performance of his task the right delegated
to me by the Fuehrer for issuing instructions to the
higher Reich authorities, their branches and the Party offices,
and their associated organisms and also the Reich Protector,
the General Governor, the Commander-in-Chief, and
heads of the civil administrations. In the case of ordinances
and instructions of fundamental importance a report is to
be submitted to me in advance.” (<span class='it'>1666-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By a Hitler decree of 30 September 1942 Sauckel was given
<span class='pageno' title='923' id='Page_923'></span>
extraordinary powers over the civil and military authorities of
the territories occupied by Germany. The decree (<span class='it'>1903-PS</span>)
provided as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I herewith authorize the Deputy General for the <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span>,
Reich-governor and district leader (Gauleiter) Fritz

of 21 March 1942 (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, page 179)
according to his own judgment in the Greater German Reich,
in the Protectorate, and in the Government General (<span class='it'>General-gouvernement</span>)
as well as in the occupied territories, measures
which will safeguard under all circumstances the regulated
deployment of labor (<span class='it'>Geordneter Arbeitseinsatz</span>) for
the German war-economy. For this purpose he may appoint
commissioners (<span class='it'>Beauftragte</span>) to the bureaux of the military
and civilian administration. These are subordinated directly
to Deputy General for the <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span>. In order to carry
out their tasks, they are entitled to issue directives to the
competent military and civilian authorities in charge of the
<span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span> and of wage-policy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“More detailed directives will be issued by the Deputy General
for the <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Within a month after his appointment, Sauckel sent Rosenberg
his “Labor Mobilization Program”, which might more appropriately
be termed Sauckel’s “Charter of Enslavement.” This program
envisaged the forcible recruitment and the maximum exploitation
of the entire labor resources of the conquered areas
and of prisoners of war in the interests of the Nazi war machine,
at the lowest conceivable degree of expenditure to the German
State. Sauckel explained his plans in these terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It must be emphasized, however, that an additional tremendous
number of foreign labor has to be found for the
Reich. The greatest pool for that purpose are the occupied
territories of the East. Consequently, it is an immediate
necessity to use the human reserves of the Conquered Soviet
Territory to the fullest extent. Should we not succeed in
obtaining the necessary amount of labor on a voluntary basis,
we must immediately institute conscription or forced labor.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Apart from the prisoners of war still in the occupied territories,
we must, therefore, requisition skilled or unskilled
<span class='pageno' title='924' id='Page_924'></span>
male and female labor from the Soviet territory from the
age of 15 up for the labor mobilization * * *.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The complete employment of all prisoners of war as well as
the use of a gigantic number of new foreign civilian workers,
men and women, has become an undisputable necessity for
the solution of the mobilization of labor program in this
war.” (<span class='it'>016-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel proceeded to implement this “Charter of Enslavement”
with certain basic directives. In Regulation No. 4, which he issued
on 7 May 1942, Sauckel provided that if voluntary recruitment of
foreign workers was unsuccessful, compulsory service should be
instituted. This regulation provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The recruitment of foreign labor will be done on the fundamental
basis of volunteering. Where, however, in the occupied
territories the appeal for volunteers does not suffice,
obligatory service and drafting must, under all circumstances,
be resorted to. This is an indisputable requirement of our
labor situation.” (<span class='it'>3044-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel provided also for the allocation of foreign labor in the
order of its importance to the Nazi war machine. Sauckel’s regulation
No. 10 of 22 August 1942 had these aims:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * 3. The resources of manpower that are available in
the occupied territories are to be employed primarily to satisfy
the requirements of importance for the war, in Germany
itself. In allocating the said labor resources in the Occupied
Territories, the following order of priority will be observed:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>a</span>) Labor required for the troops, the occupation authorities,
and the civil authorities;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>b</span>) Labor required for the German armaments (<span class='it'>Ruestungen</span>);</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>c</span>) Labor required for food and agriculture;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>d</span>) Labor required for industrial work other than armaments,

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>e</span>) Labor required for industrial work in the interests of
the population of the territory in question.” (<span class='it'>3044-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel and agencies subordinate to him exercised exclusive
authority over the recruitment of workers from every area in
Europe occupied by, controlled by, or friendly to the German
nation. Sauckel affirmed this authority in the following decree:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The recruitment of foreign labor in the areas occupied by
Germany, in allied, friendly or neutral states will be carried
<span class='pageno' title='925' id='Page_925'></span>
out exclusively by my commissioners, or by the competent
German military or civil agencies for the tasks of labor
mobilization.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For the carrying out of recruitment in allied, friendly or
neutral foreign countries, my commissioners are solely responsible.”
(<span class='it'>3044-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel participated in the formulation of overall labor requirements
for Germany and assigned quotas to be filled by and
with the assistance of the individuals and agencies mentioned
above, with knowledge that force and brutality were the only
means whereby his demands could be met. Thus, the Lammer’s
report states (<span class='it'>1292-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. A conference took place with the Fuehrer today which
was attended by:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor Gauleiter
Sauckel,</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Secretary for Armament and War Production, Speer,</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Chief of the Supreme Command of the Army, General
Field Marshal Keitel, General Field Marshal Milch,</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Acting Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture State
Secretary Backe,</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Minister of the Interior, Reichfuehrer SS Himmler,
and myself.</p>

<p class='noindent'>(The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of
National Economy had repeatedly asked to be permitted to
participate prior to the Conference, but the Fuehrer did not
wish their attendance.)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer declared in his introductory remarks:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right95percent'>

<p class='noindent'>‘I want a clear picture:</p>

<p class='noindent'>(1) How many workers are required for the maintenance
of German War Economy?</p>

<p class='noindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) For the maintenance of present output?</p>

<p class='noindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) To increase its output?</p>

<p class='noindent'>(2) How many workers can be obtained from Occupied
Countries, or how many can still be gained in the Reich by
suitable means (increased output)? For one thing, it is
this matter of making up for losses by death, infirmity,
the constant fluctuation of workers, and so forth, and further
it is a matter of procuring additional workers.’</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“The Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor, Sauckel,
declared that, in order to maintain the present pool of workers,
<span class='pageno' title='926' id='Page_926'></span>
he would have to add at least 2½ but probably 3 million
new workers in 1944. Otherwise production would fall off.
Reichsminister Speer declared that he needs an additional
1.3 million laborers. However, this would depend on whether
it will be possible to increase production of iron ore. Should
this not be possible, he would need no additional workers.
Procurement of additional workers from Occupied Territory
would, however, be subject to the condition that these workers
will not be withdrawn from armament and auxiliary industries
already working there. For this would mean a
decrease of production of these industries which he could
not tolerate. Those, for instance, who are already working
in France in industries mentioned above, must be protected
against being sent to work in Germany by the Plenipotentiary
for the Employment of Labor. The Fuehrer agreed
with the opinions of Reichsminister Speer and emphasized
that the measures taken by the Plenipotentiary for the Employment
of Labor should order no circumstances which
would lead to the withdrawal of workers from armament
and auxiliary industries working in occupied territories, because
such a shift of workers would only cause disturbance
of production in occupied countries.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer further called attention to the fact that at
least 250,000 laborers will be required for preparations
against air attacks in the field of civilian air raid protection.
For Vienna alone, 2,000-2,500 are required immediately. The
Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor must add at
least 4 million workers to the manpower pool, considering
that he requires 2½ million workers for maintenance of the
present level, that Reich Minister Speer needs 1.3 million
additional workers, and that the above-mentioned preparations
for security measures against air attacks call for 0.25
million laborers.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsfuehrer SS explained that the enforcement
agents put at his disposal are extremely few, but that he
would try helping the Sauckel project to succeed by increasing
them and working them harder. The Reichsfuehrer SS
made immediately available 2,000 to 2,500 men from concentration
camps for air raid preparations in Vienna.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, Sauckel, in requesting the assistance of the Army
for the recruitment of 1,000,000 men and women from the occupied
Eastern territories, informed Keitel that prompt action
was required; and that, as in all other occupied countries, pressure
had to be used if other measures were not successful (<span class='it'>3012-PS</span>).
Finally, Sauckel was informed by Rosenberg that the enslavement
of foreign labor was achieved by force and brutality
(<span class='it'>018-PS</span>). Notwithstanding his knowledge of conditions, Sauckel
continued to request greater supplies of manpower from the
areas in which the most ruthless methods had been applied. Indeed,
when German Field Commanders on the Eastern Front attempted
to resist Sauckel’s demands, because forced recruitment
was swelling the ranks of the partisans and making the army’s
task more difficult, Sauckel sent a telegram to Hitler, dated 10
March 1943, in which he implored him to intervene:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore, my Fuehrer, I ask you to abolish all orders which
oppose the obligation of foreign workers for labor * * *.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If the obligation for labor and the forced recruiting of
workers in the East is not possible any more, then the German
war industry and agriculture cannot fulfill their tasks
to the full extent.” (<span class='it'>407-II-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to being responsible for the recruitment of foreign
civilian labor by force, Sauckel was responsible for the conditions
under which foreign workers were deported to Germany and for
the treatment to which they were subjected within Germany. The
conditions under which Sauckel’s slaves were transported to
Germany, were known to Sauckel (<span class='it'>2241-PS</span>). Moreover, he accepted
responsibility for these conditions. Regulation Number 4
of 7 May 1942, issued by Sauckel as Plenipotentiary General for
the Mobilization of Labor, deals with recruitment, care, lodging,
feeding, and treatment of foreign workers of both sexes (<span class='it'>3044-PS</span>).
By this decree, Sauckel expressly directed that the assembly
and operation of rail transports and the supplying of food therefor
was the responsibility of his agents until the transports arrived
in Germany. By the same regulation, Sauckel directed that
within Germany the care of foreign industrial workers was to be
carried out by the German Labor Front and that care of foreign
agricultural workers was to be carried out by the Reich Food
Administration. By the terms of the regulation, Sauckel reserved
for himself ultimate responsibility for all aspects of care, treatment,
<span class='pageno' title='928' id='Page_928'></span>
lodging, and feeding of foreign workers while in transit
to and within Germany. The regulation reads (<span class='it'>3044-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The care of foreign labor will be carried out.</p>

<p class='hang'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> up to the Reichs border<br/>

(<span class='it'>3044-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel, in an agreement with Ley, the head of the German
Labor Front (DAF) dated 2 June 1943, again emphasized his
ultimate responsibility by creating a central inspectorate charged
with examining the working and living conditions of foreign
<span class='pageno' title='929' id='Page_929'></span>
workers, and reporting thereon to Sauckel’s agency (<span class='it'>1913-PS</span>).
The agreement reads in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * 2. The Reichsleiter of the German Labor Front,
Reichsorganisationleiter Dr. Ley, in collaboration with the
Plenipotentiary General for the <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span>, Gauleiter
Sauckel, will establish a ‘central inspection’ for the continuous
supervision of all measures concerning the care of the
foreign workers mentioned under 1. This will have the
designation:</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Central inspection for care of foreign workers.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The central inspection for the care of foreign workers
exercises its functions upon directives and in the name of
the Plenipotentiary General for the <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span> and of
the Reichsleiter of the German Labor Front. In order to
avoid all duplication of work, it will be its sole responsibility,
to scrutinize all measures taken for the care of foreign
workers employed in the factories and camps, also to
remove immediately all defects discovered—as far as possible—on
the spot and to issue the necessary instructions
for this.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The authority of the Plenipotentiary General for the
<span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span> to empower the members of his staff and the
presidents of the state employment offices to get direct information

immediately in each case in which action of State organizations
seems to be necessary.” (<span class='it'>1913-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel was also responsible for compelling citizens of the occupied
countries against their will to manufacture implements of
war for use in operations against their own country and its allies.
These functions were included in the terms of Sauckel’s appointment.
(<span class='it'>1666-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a series of reports to Hitler, Sauckel described how successful
he had been in carrying out his program. One such report,
<span class='pageno' title='930' id='Page_930'></span>
dated 14 April 1943, states that in a single year Sauckel had incorporated
1,622,829 prisoners of war into the German economy:</p>

(<span class='it'>407-V-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A subsequent report dated 3 June 1943, states that 846,511
additional foreign laborers and prisoners of war were incorporated
into the German war industry:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“My Fuehrer:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. I beg to be permitted to report to you on the situation

industry: * * * Total: 846,511”. (<span class='it'>407-IX-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>9. THE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF INDIVIDUAL CONSPIRATORS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, the following conspirators who were informed by
Sauckel of the quotas of foreign laborers which he required, collaborated
with Sauckel and his agents in filling these quotas:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Keitel, Chief of the OKW.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The record of a telephone conversation of the Chief of the
Economic Staff East of the German Army, dated 11 March 1943,
reads in part as follows (<span class='it'>3012-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The plenipotentiary for the <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span>, Gauleiter
Sauckel, points out to me in an urgent teletype, that the
<span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span> in German agriculture as well as all the most
urgent armament programs, ordered by the Fuehrer, make
the most rapid procurement of approx. 1 million women
and men from the newly occupied territories an imperative
necessity. For this purpose, Gauleiter Sauckel demands the
shipment of 5,000 workers daily beginning 15 March, 10,000
workers male and female beginning 1 April from the newly
occupied territories.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The daily quota of 5,000 (10,000) workers was distributed
with the consent of the GBA as follows:
<span class='pageno' title='931' id='Page_931'></span></p>

<p class='hang'>Reich Commissioner Ukraine daily 3,000 (6,000) workers.</p>

<p class='hang'>Wl Jn South daily 1,000 (2,000) workers.</p>

<p class='hang'>Wl Jn Center daily 500 (1,000) workers.</p>

<p class='hang'>Commissioner General White Ruthenia daily 500 (1,000) workers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In consideration of the extraordinary losses of workers,
which occurred in German war industry because of the
developments of the past months, it is now necessary, that
the recruiting of workers be taken up again everywhere
with all emphasis. The tendency momentarily noticeable in
that territory, to limit and/or entirely stop the Reich recruiting
program is absolutely not bearable in view of this state
of affairs. Gauleiter Sauckel, who is informed about these
events, has because of this, turned immediately to General
Fieldmarshal Keitel on 10 March 1943, in a teletype, and has
emphasized on this occasion, that, as in all other occupied
territories, there, where all other methods fail, by order of
the Fuehrer a certain pressure must be used.” (<span class='it'>3012-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Confirmation of Keitel’s collaboration with Sauckel is also
found in the transcript of an interrogation under oath of Sauckel
held on the morning of 5 October 1945:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. Was it necessary in order to accomplish the completion
of the quotas given to have liaison with the OKW?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. I remember that the Fuehrer had given directives
to Marshal Keitel, telling him that my task was a very important
one, and I, too, have often conferred with Keitel
after such discussions with the Fuehrer, when I asked him
for his support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. It was his task to supervise the proper performance
of the military commanders in the occupied countries in
carrying out their missions, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes, the Fuehrer had told me that he would inform
the Chief of the OKW, and the Chief of the Reichs chancellery,
as to these missions. The same applies to the Foreign
Minister.” (<span class='it'>3722-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Alfred Rosenberg, Reichs Minister for the Occupied Eastern
Territories.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The following colloquy is taken from the transcript of an
interrogation under oath of Alfred Rosenberg on the afternoon
of 6 October 1945:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. Isn’t it a fact, that Sauckel would allocate to the
various areas under your jurisdiction the number of persons
to be obtained for labor purposes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='932' id='Page_932'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. And that thereafter, your agents would obtain that
labor, in order to meet the quota which had been given; isn’t
that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Sauckel, normally, had very far-reaching desires,
which one couldn’t fulfill unless one looked very closely into
the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. Never mind about Sauckel’s desires being far-reaching
or not being far-reaching. That has nothing to do with
it. You were given quotas for the areas over which you had
jurisdiction, and it was up to you to meet that quota?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes; it was the responsibility of the administrative
officials to receive this quota and to distribute the allotments
over the districts in such a way, according to number and
according to the age groups, so they would be most reasonably
met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. These administrative officials were part of your organization,
isn’t that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. They were functionaries or officials of the Reichskommissar
for the Ukraine, but, as such, they were placed
in their office by the Ministry for the Eastern Occupied Territories.”
(<span class='it'>3719-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Corroboration is to be found in letters written by Sauckel to
Rosenberg requesting the latter’s assistance in the recruitment of
additional foreign laborers. (<span class='it'>017-PS</span>; <span class='it'>019-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Seyss-Inquart, Reichscommissar for the Occupied Netherlands.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The transcript of an interrogation under oath of Sauckel on
the morning of 5 October 1945, reads in part, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. For a moment, I want to turn our attention to Holland.
It is my understanding that the quotas for the workers
from Holland were agreed upon, and then the numbers given
to the Reichskommissar Seyss-Inquart to fulfill, is that
correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. After the quota was given to Seyss-Inquart, it was
his mission to fulfill it with the aid of your representatives;
was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes. This was the only possible thing for me to do
and the same applied to other countries.” (<span class='it'>3722-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>D. <span class='it'>Frank, Governor-General of the Government-General of
Poland.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The transcript of interrogation under oath of Sauckel on the
morning of 5 October 1945 reveals the part played by Frank:
<span class='pageno' title='933' id='Page_933'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. Was the same procedure substantially followed of allocating
quotas in the General Government Poland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes. I have to basically state again that the only possibility
I had in carrying through these missions was to get
in touch with the highest German military authority in the
respective country and to transfer to them the orders of the
Fuehrer and ask them very urgently, as I have always done,
to fulfill these orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. Such discussions in Poland, of course, were with the
General Governor Frank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes. I spent a morning and afternoon in Krakov
twice or three times, and I personally spoke to General Governor
Frank. Naturally, there was also present Secretary
Dr. Goebble.” (<span class='it'>3722-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>E. <span class='it'>The SS, as in all matters involving the use of force and
brutality, extended its assistance.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This is clearly indicated in Reichschancellor Lammers’ report
of a conference with Hitler attended by, among others, Sauckel,
Speer, and Himmler (the Reichsfuehrer SS). The conference proceeded
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Plenipotentiary for Employment of Labor, Sauckel, declared
that he will attempt with fanatical determination to
obtain these workers. Until now, he has always kept his
promises as to the number of workers to be furnished. With
the best of intentions, however, he is unable to make a
definite promise for 1944. He will do everything in his
powers to furnish the requested manpower in 1944. Whether
it will succeed depends primarily on what <span class='it'>German</span> enforcement
agents will be made available. His project cannot be
carried out with domestic enforcement agents. The Reichsfuehrer
SS explained that the enforcement agents put at his
disposal are extremely few, but that he would try helping
the Sauckel project to succeed by increasing them and working
them harder.” (<span class='it'>1292-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>10. THE SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF SPEER</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The use of prisoners of war in the manufacture of arms and
munitions, allocated thereto by Sauckel, was confirmed by Speer.
Speer stated in an interrogation under oath on 18 October 1945
that 40% of all prisoners of war were employed in the production
of weapons and munitions and in subsidiary industries:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“* * * A. In the last phase of production, that is, in
the year 1944 when everything collapsed, I had 40% of all
<span class='pageno' title='934' id='Page_934'></span>
prisoners of war employed in the production. I wanted to
have this percentage increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. And when you say employed in the production, you
mean in these subsidiary industries that you have discussed
and also in the production of weapons and munitions, is that
right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes. That is the total extent of my task.” (<span class='it'>3720-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The minutes of the 36th Meeting of the Central Planning Board,
of 22 April 1943, report Speer’s statement that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * 90,000 Russian prisoners of war employed in the
whole of the armament industry are for the greatest part
skilled men.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Speer actively participated in the planning and execution of
the vast program of forcible deportation and enslavement of the
citizens of the occupied countries. As Reich Minister of Armaments
and Munitions and Chief of the Organization Todt, both
of which positions he acquired on 15 February 1942, and by
virtue of his later acquisition of control over the armament
offices of the Army, Navy and Airforce and the production offices
of the Ministry of Economics, Speer was responsible for the entire
war production of the Reich, as well as for the construction
of fortifications and installations for the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. Proof of
the positions held by Speer is supplied by his signed statement.
(<span class='it'>2980-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The industries under Speer’s control were the most important
users of manpower in Germany. According to Sauckel, Speer’s
labor requirements received unconditional priority over all other
demands for labor. In an interrogation under oath on 22nd September
1945, Sauckel stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The others I only got whatever was left. Because Speer
told me once in the presence of the Fuehrer that I am here
to work for Speer and that mainly I am his man.” (<span class='it'>3721-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Speer has admitted under oath that he participated in the discussions
during which the decision to use foreign forced labor
was made, that he concurred in the decision, and that it was the
basis for the program of bringing foreign workers into Germany
by compulsion. The transcript of the interrogation under oath
of Speer, on 18 October 1945, contains the following colloquy:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. But is it clear to you Mr. Speer, that in 1942 when
the decisions were being taken concerning the use of forced
foreign labor that you participated in the discussions yourself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. So that I take it that the execution of the program of
<span class='pageno' title='935' id='Page_935'></span>
bringing foreign workers into Germany by compulsion under
Sauckel was based on earlier decisions that had been taken
with your agreement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes, but I must point out that only a very small part
of the manpower that Sauckel brought into Germany was
made available to me; a far larger part of it was allocated
to other departments that demanded them.” (<span class='it'>3720-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This admission is confirmed by minutes of Speer’s conferences
with Hitler on 10, 11, and 12 August 1942 (<span class='it'>R-124</span>). In these meetings
Speer related the outcome of negotiations concerning the
forcible recruitment of a million Russian laborers for the German
armaments industry, and stated that Hitler would agree to any
necessary compulsion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The use of force was again discussed by Hitler and Speer on
4 January 1943. It was decided that stronger measures were to
be used to accelerate the conscription of French civilian workers.
(<span class='it'>556-13-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speer demanded foreign workers for the industries under his
control and used these workers with the knowledge that they
had been deported by force and were being compelled to work.
Speer has stated under oath, in an interrogation on 18 October
1945 that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I do not wish to give the impression that I want to deny
the fact that I demanded manpower and foreign manpower
from Sauckel very energetically.” (<span class='it'>3720-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Speer also admitted, in the course of the same interrogation, that
he knew he was obtaining foreign labor, a large part of which
was forced labor:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. So that during the period when you were asking for
labor, it seems clear, does it not, that you knew that you were
obtaining foreign labor as well as domestic labor in response
to your requests and that a large part of the foreign
labor was forced labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. So that, simply by way of illustration, suppose that
on January 1, 1944 you required 50,000 workers for a given
purpose, would you put in a requisition for 50,000 workers,
knowing that in that 50,000 there would be forced foreign
workers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes.” (<span class='it'>3720-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Speer has furthermore stated under oath that he knew at least
as early as September 1942 that workers from the Ukraine were
being forcibly deported for labor in Germany. He also knew
that the great majority of the workers of the Western occupied
<span class='pageno' title='936' id='Page_936'></span>
countries were slave laborers forced against their will to come
to Germany. These facts are revealed in his interrogation under
oath on 18 October 1945:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. When did you first find out then that some of the manpower
from the Ukraine was not coming voluntarily?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. It is rather difficult to answer this here, that is, to
name a certain date to you. However, it is certain that I
knew that at some particular point of time that the manpower
from the Ukraine did not come voluntarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. And does that apply also to the manpower from other
occupied countries, that is, did there come a time when you
knew that they were not coming voluntarily?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. When, in general, would you say that time was, without
placing a particular month of the year?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. As far as the Ukraine situation goes, I believe that
they did not come voluntarily any more after a few months,
because immense mistakes were made in their treatment by
us. I should say offhand that this time was either in July,
August or September of 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. But many workers did come from the West, did they
not, to Germany?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. That means then that the great majority of the
workers that came from the Western countries, the Western
occupied countries, came against their will to Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes.” (<span class='it'>3720-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This admission is borne out by other evidence. In April 1943
Speer was informed at a meeting of the Central Planning Board,
that in all countries conscription for work in Germany could be
carried out only with the active assistance of the police, and that
the prevailing methods of recruitment had provoked such violence
that many German recruiting agents had been killed (<span class='it'>R-124</span>).
Again, at a meeting with Hitler to discuss overall manpower
requirements for 1944, Speer was informed by Sauckel that labor
requirements for the German war economy (including Speer’s
requirements of 1,300,000 additional laborers) could be met only
if German enforcement agents were furnished to carry out the
enslavement program in the occupied countries. (<span class='it'>1292-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding his knowledge that foreign workers were being
conscripted and deported for use as slave laborers in Germany,
Speer formulated requirements for the foreign workers
and requested their allocation to industries subject to his control.
<span class='pageno' title='937' id='Page_937'></span>
At another meeting of the Central Planning Board, Speer stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Speer</span>: Now, the labor problem in Germany. I believe it
is still possible to transfer some from the western territories.
The Fuehrer stated only recently he wishes to dissolve these
foreign volunteers as he had the impression that the army
groups were carting around with them a lot of ballast. Therefore,
if we cannot settle this matter ourselves, we shall have
to call a meeting with the Fuehrer to clear up the coal situation.
Keitel and Zeitzler will be invited to attend in order
to determine the number of Russians from the rear army
territories who can be sent to us. However, I see another
possibility; we might organize another drive to screen out
workers for the mines from the Russian Ps/W in the Reich.
But this possibility is none too promising.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At another meeting of the Central Planning Board, Speer rejected
a suggestion that labor for industries under his control
be furnished from German sources instead of from foreign countries,
for these reasons:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Speer</span>: We do it that way: Kehrl collects the demands
for labor necessary to complete the coal-and-iron-plan and
communicates the numbers to Sauckel. Probably there will
be a conference at the Reich Marshal’s in the next week,
and an answer from Sauckel should have arrived by then.
The question of recruitment for the armaments industry will
be solved together with Weger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Kehrl</span>: I wish to urge that the allotments to the mines
should not be made dependent on the recruitment of men
abroad. We were completely frustrated these last three
months because this principle had been applied. We ended
December with a deficit of 25,000 and we never get replacements.
The number must be made up by men from Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Speer</span>: No, nothing doing!” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Speer also advocated terror and brutality as a means of maximizing
production by slave laborers who worked in the industries
under his control. In the course of a discussion concerning the
supply and exploitation of labor, Speer stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Speer</span>: We must also discuss the slackers. Ley has ascertained
that the sick list decreased to one-fourth or one-fifth
in factories where doctors are on the staff who are examining
the sick men. There is nothing to be said against SS
and Police taking drastic steps and putting those known as
slackers into concentration camps. There is no alternative.
Let it happen several times and the news will soon go
round.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='938' id='Page_938'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Speer is also guilty of compelling Allied nationals and prisoners
of war to engage not only in the production of armaments
and munitions, but also in direct military operations, against
their own country and its actively resisting allies. Speer, as
Chief of the Organization Todt, is accountable for its policies
which were in direct conflict with the laws of war. The Organization
Todt, in violation of the laws of war, impressed allied
nationals into its service. Proof of its activity is furnished by
an International Labor Office Study of Exploitation of Foreign
Labor by Germany:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The methods used for the recruitment of foreign workers
who were destined for employment in the Organization did
not greatly differ from the methods used for the recruitment
of foreigners for deportation to Germany. The main difference
was that, since the principal activities of the Organization
lay outside the frontiers of Germany, foreigners were
not transported to Germany, but had either to work in their
own country or in some other occupied territory.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the recruitment drives for foreign workers for the Organization
methods of compulsion as well as methods of persuasion
were used, the latter usually with very little result
* * *.” (<span class='it'>L-191</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Similar violations of the laws of warfare are disclosed in
(<span class='it'>407-VIII-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Chief of German war production, Speer sponsored and approved
the use of prisoners of war in the production of armaments
and munitions which were used against their own country
and its actively resisting allies. This fact has been demonstrated
by the evidence already discussed. To recapitulate:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. After Speer assumed responsibility for armament production,
his primary concern in his discussions with his co-conspirators
was to secure a larger allocation of prisoners of war for his
armament factories. In a meeting of the Central Planning Board
on 22 April 1943, Speer complained that only 30% of the Russian
prisoners of war were engaged in the armament industry.
(<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. In an earlier speech, Speer stated that 10,000 prisoners of
war were put at the disposal of the armaments industry upon his
orders. (<span class='it'>1435-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Finally, Speer advocated returning escaped prisoners of war
to factories as convicts. He said, at a meeting of the Central
Planning Board:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We have to come to an arrangement with the Reichsfuehrer
SS as soon as possible so that prisoners of war he picks up
<span class='pageno' title='939' id='Page_939'></span>
are made available for our purposes. The Reichsfuehrer SS
gets from 30 to 40,000 men per month. First of all they have
to be divided up. From what classes do these people come,
anyhow? There certainly is a certain percentage of miners
among these people who are picked up. These few thousand
men have to go to the mines automatically. Certainly, some
educational work has to be done. The men should be put
into the factories as convicts. But they have to return to
the factories where they were before * * *.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Speer is also guilty of having approved and sponsored the program
for using concentration camp labor in Nazi armament
factories, which was part of the larger program of extermination
through work. The proof of this activity may be summarized
and supplemented as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. Speer proposed measures for the exploitation of the concentration
camp labor in armament factories under his jurisdiction.
At a meeting with Hitler Speer proposed and Hitler agreed
that armament production should not be established within concentration
camps but that concentration camp labor should be
made available to established armament factories. (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Speer, by arranging for the use of concentration camp laborers
in factories under his control, created an increasing demand
for such labor. This demand was filled in part by placing in
concentration camps persons who would not ordinarily have been
sent there. (<span class='it'>1063-D-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Speer participated in the exploitation of the victims of the
Nazi program of extermination through work. He personally
selected sites for subsidiary concentration camps which were
established near factories in Upper Austria, and knew and approved
of the general practice of locating concentration camps
near industrial plants which they supplied with labor (Speer’s
interrogation under oath on 18 October 1945. (<span class='it'>3720-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speer visited the concentration camp Mauthaussen and factories
such as those of Krupp, where concentration camp labor
was exploited under barbarous conditions. Despite personal and
first-hand knowledge of these conditions, Speer continued to
direct the use of concentration camp labor in factories under his
jurisdiction. In Speer’s interrogation under oath on 18 October
1945, he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. But, in general, the use of concentration camp labor
was known to you and approved by you as a source of labor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. And you knew also, I take it, that among the inmates
of the concentration camps there were both Germans and
foreigners?
<span class='pageno' title='940' id='Page_940'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. I didn’t think about it at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. As a matter of fact you visited the Austrian concentration
camp personally, did you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. I didn’t—well I was in Mauthaussen once but at that
time I was not told just to what categories the inmates of
the concentration camps belonged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. But in general everybody knew, did they not, that
foreigners who were taken away by the Gestapo, or arrested
by the Gestapo, as well as Germans, found their way into
the concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. Of course, yes. I didn’t mean to imply anything like
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. Did you ever discuss, by the way, the requirements
of Krupp for foreign labor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. It is certain that it was reported to me what Krupp
had in foreign workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Q. Did you ever discuss it with any of the members of the
Krupp first?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A. I cannot say that exactly, but during the time of my
activities I visited the Krupp factory more than once and
it is certain that this was discussed, that is, the lack of manpower.”

<div><span class='pageno' title='949' id='Page_949'></span><h1>Chapter XI<br/> CONCENTRATION CAMPS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Concentration Camp, used against the people of Germany
and allied nationals, was one of the fundamental institutions of
the Nazi regime. It was a pillar of the system of terror by which
the Nazis consolidated their power over Germany. It was a primary
weapon in the battle against the Jews, against the Christian
church, against labor, against those who wanted peace, against
opposition or non-conformity of any kind. It involved the systematic
use of terror to achieve the cohesion within Germany
which was necessary for the execution of the conspirators’ plans
for aggression. It was the final link in a chain of terror and repression
which involved the SS and the Gestapo and which resulted
in the apprehension of victims and their confinement
without trial, often without charges, generally with no indication
of the length of their detention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The SS through its espionage system tracked down the victims;
the criminal police and the Gestapo seized them and brought them
to the concentration camps; and the concentration camps were
administered by the SS. No attempt will be made to present a
complete catalogue of individual brutalities. The emphasis will
rather be upon the fundamental purposes for which these camps
were used, the techniques of terror which were employed, the
large number of their victims, and the death and anguish which
they caused.</p>

<h3>1. THE BEGINNING OF “PROTECTIVE CUSTODY”</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis realized early that without the most drastic repression
of actual and potential opposition they could not consolidate
their power over the German people. Immediately after Hitler
became Chancellor, the conspirators promptly destroyed civil liberties
by issuing the Presidential Emergency Decree of 28 February
1933 (<span class='it'>1390-PS</span>). It was this decree which was the basis for
“<span class='it'>Schutzhaft</span>”, that is, “protective custody”—the power of the
Gestapo to imprison people without judicial proceedings. This
is made clear by a typical order for protective custody:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Order of Protective Custody.</span> Based on Article 1 of the Decree
of the Reich President for the Protection of People and
State of 28 February 1933 (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> I, p. 83), you
are taken into protective custody in the interest of public
security and order.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Reason: Suspicion of activities inimical toward the State.”
(<span class='it'>2499-PS</span>)</p>

</div>
<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='950' id='Page_950'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering, in a book entitled “<span class='it'>Aufbau Einer Nation</span>” and published
in 1934, sought to give the impression that the camps originally
were directed at those whom the Nazis considered “Communists”
and “Social Democrats”. At page 89 of this book he
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We had to deal ruthlessly with these enemies of the State.
It must not be forgotten that at the moment of our seizure
of power over 6 million people officially voted for Communism
and about 8 million for Marxism in the Reichstag elections
in March.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Thus the concentration camps were created, to which we
had to send first thousands of functionaries of the Communist
and Social Democratic parties.” (<span class='it'>2324-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In practical operations, the power to order confinement was
almost without limit: Frick, in an order which he issued on 25
January 1938, as Minister of Interior, made this clear. Article
1 of this order provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Protective custody can be decreed as a coercive measure of
the Secret State Police against persons who endanger the
security of the people and the State through their attitude
in order to counter all aspirations of enemies of the people
and State.” (<span class='it'>1723-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This order further provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * In a summary of all the previously issued decrees
on the cooperation between the Party and the Gestapo I refer
to the following and ordain:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. To the Gestapo has been entrusted the mission by the
Fuehrer to watch over and to eliminate all enemies of the
Party and the National Socialist State as well as all disintegrating
forces of all kinds directed against both. The successful
solution of this mission forms one of the most essential
prerequisite for the unhampered and frictionless work
of the Party. The Gestapo, in their extremely difficult task,
is to be granted support and assistance in every possible way
by the NSDAP.” (<span class='it'>1723-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Persecution of Pacifists.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The conspirators, then, were directing their apparatus of terror
against the “enemies of the State”, against “disintegrating
forces”, and against those people who endangered the State “with
their attitudes”. Whom did they consider as belonging in these
broad categories? First, they were the men in Germany who
wanted peace. In this connection an affidavit by Gerhart H. Segar
declares as follows:
<span class='pageno' title='951' id='Page_951'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * 2. During the period after World War I up until
my commitment to the Leipzig jail and Oranienburg concentration
camp in the spring of 1933 following the Nazis’ accession
to power in January of that year, my business and
political affiliations exposed me to the full impact of the Nazi
theories and practice of violent regimentation and terroristic
tactics. My conflict with the Nazis by virtue of my identification
with the peace movement, and as duly elected member
of the Reichstag representing a political faith (Social
Democratic Party) hostile to National Socialism, clearly demonstrated
that, even in the period prior to 1933, the Nazis
considered crimes and terrorism a necessary and desirable
weapon in overcoming democratic opposition * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * (e). That the Nazis had already conceived the device
of the concentration camp as a means of suppressing
and regimenting opposition elements was forcefully brought
to my attention during the course of a conversation which I
had with Dr. Wilhelm Frick in December 1932. Frick at that
time was Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
Reichstag of which I was a member. When I gave an emphatic
answer to Frick concerning the particular matter discussed,
he replied, ‘Don’t worry, when we are in power we
shall put all of you guys into concentration camps.’ When
the Nazis came into power, Frick was appointed Reichminister
of Interior and promptly carried out his threat in collaboration
with Goering, as Chief of the Prussian State Police,
and Himmler.” (<span class='it'>L-83</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus, even before the Nazis had seized power in Germany they
had conceived of the plan to repress any potential opposition by
terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick’s statement to Gerhart Segar is completely consistent
with an earlier statement which he made on 18 October 1929.
Frick at that time declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“This fateful struggle will first be taken up with the ballot,
but this cannot continue indefinitely, for history has taught
us that in a battle, blood must be shed, and iron broken. The
ballot is the beginning of this fateful struggle. We are determined
to promulgate by force that which we preach. Just
as Mussolini exterminated the Marxists in Italy, so must we
also succeed in accomplishing the same through dictatorship
and terror.” (<span class='it'>2513-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There are many additional cases of the use of the concentration
camp against the men who wanted peace. There was, for example,
<span class='pageno' title='952' id='Page_952'></span>
a group called the “<span class='it'>Bibel Forscher</span>” (Bible Research
Workers), most of whom were Jehovah’s Witnesses. Since they
were pacifists, the conspirators provided not only for their prosecution
in the regular courts, but also for confining them in concentration
camps after they had served the judicial sentences.
An order by the Secret State Police, Berlin, dated 5 August 1937,
provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsminister of Justice had informed me that he does
not share the opinion voiced by subordinate departments on
various occasions, according to which, the arrest of the <span class='it'>Bibelforschers</span>
after they have served a sentence, is supposed to
jeopardize the authority of the law courts. He is fully
aware of the necessity for measures by the State Police after
the sentence has been served. He asks, however, not to bring
the <span class='it'>Bibelforschers</span> into protective custody under circumstances
detrimental to the respect of the law courts * * *.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. If information regarding the impending release of a
<span class='it'>Bibelforscher</span> from arrest is received from the authorities
carrying out the sentence, my decision regarding the ordering
of measures by the State Police, will be asked for in accordance
with my circular decree dated 22.4.37, so that
transfer to a concentration camp can take place immediately
after the sentence has been served. Should a transfer into
a concentration camp immediately after the serving of the
sentence not be possible, <span class='it'>Bibelforschers</span> will be detained in
police prisons.” (<span class='it'>D-84</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Persecution of Trade Union Members.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Labor unions, traditionally opposed to wars of aggression, also
felt the full force of Nazi terror. The concentration camp was
an important weapon in the campaign against the trade unions.
Goering made it plain, for instance, that members of the Social
Democratic Party were to be confined in concentration camps
(<span class='it'>2324-PS</span>). Labor leaders were largely members of that party
and soon learned the meaning of “protective custody”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection, an order that one Joseph Simon should be
placed in protective custody, is pertinent (<span class='it'>2330-PS</span>). The “reasons”
given were as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Simon was for many years a member of the Socialist Party
and temporarily a member of the Union Socialiste Populaire.
From 1907 to 1918 he was <span class='it'>Landtag</span> deputy of the Socialist
Party; from 1908 to 1930 Social Democratic City Counsellor
(<span class='it'>Stadtrat</span>) in Nurnberg. In view of the decisive role which
<span class='pageno' title='953' id='Page_953'></span>
Simon played in the international trade unions and in regard
to his connection with international Marxist leaders and central
agencies, which he continued after the national recovery,
he was placed under protective custody on 3 May 1933, and
was kept, until 25 January 1934, in the Dachau concentration
camp. Simon is under the urgent suspicion that even after
this date he played an active part in the illegal continuation
of the Socialist Party. He took part in meetings which aimed
at the illegal continuation of the Socialist Party and propagation
of illegal Marxist printed matter in Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Through this radical attitude which is hostile to the State,
Simon directly endangers public security and order.” (<span class='it'>2330-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Further instances of this persecution of members of trade unions
are contained in (<span class='it'>2334-PS</span>) and (<span class='it'>2928-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Persecution of Jews.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Thousands of Jews, were, of course, confined in concentration
camps. (For a fuller discussion of this point see Chapter XII.)
Among the wealth of evidence showing the confinement of Germans
only because they were Jews, a teletype from SS Gruppenfuehrer
Heydrich is typical. This order is dated 10 November
1938, and is addressed to all headquarters of the State Police and
all districts and sub-districts of the SD (<span class='it'>3051-PS</span>). Paragraph 5
of this teletype, which was entitled “Measures against Jews tonight,”
provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * 5. Inasmuch as in the course of the events of this
night the employment of officials used for this purpose would
be possible, in all districts as many Jews, especially rich ones,
are to be arrested as can be accommodated in the existing
prisons. For the time being only healthy men not too old
are to be arrested. Upon their arrest, the appropriate concentration
camps should be contacted immediately, in order
to confine them in these camps as fast as possible.” (<span class='it'>3051-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Himmler in 1943 indicated that use of the concentration camp
against the Jews had been motivated, not simply by Nazi racialism,
but also by a fear that the Jews might have been an obstacle
to aggression. In a speech delivered at a meeting of the SS Major
Generals at Posen on 4 October 1943, Himmler sought to justify
the Nazi anti-Jewish policy:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I mean the clearing out of the Jews, the extermination of
the Jewish race. It’s one of those things it is easy to talk
about—‘The Jewish race is being exterminated’, says one
party member, ‘that’s quite clear, it’s in our program, elimination
<span class='pageno' title='954' id='Page_954'></span>
of the Jews, and we’re doing it, exterminating them’.
And then they come, 80 million worthy Germans, and each
one has his decent Jew. Of course, the others are vermin,
but this one is an A-1 Jew. Not one of all those who talk
this way has witnessed it, not one of them has been through
it. Most of you must know what it means when 100 corpses
are lying side by side, or 500 or 1,000. To have stuck it out
and at the same time—apart from exceptions caused by human
weakness—to have remained decent fellows, that is what
has made us hard. This is a page of glory in our history
which has never been written and is never to be written, for
we know how difficult we should have made it for ourselves,
if—with the bombing raids, the burden and deprivations of
war—we still had Jews today in every town as secret saboteurs,
agitators and trouble-mongers.” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear from the foregoing evidence that prior to the launching
of a Nazi aggression, the concentration camp had been one
of the principal weapons by which the conspirators achieved
the social cohesion which was needed for the execution of their
plans for aggression. After the conspirators launched their
aggression and their armies swept over Europe, they brought the
concentration camp and the whole system of Nazi terror to occupied
countries. In addition, they brought the citizens of the occupied
countries to Germany and subjected them to the whole apparatus
of Nazi brutality. In a communication to Himmler
dated 16 December 1942, Mueller, for the Chief of the Security
Police and SD, deals with the seizure of Polish Jews for deportation
to concentration camps in Germany. I should like to quote
the body of this communication:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In connection with the increase in the transfer of labor to
the <span class='it'>concentration camps</span>, ordered to be completed by 30
January 1943, the following procedure may be applied in
the Jewish section.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Total number: 45,000 Jews.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Start of transportation: 11 January 1943; End of transportation:
31 January 1943. (The Reich railroads are unable
to provide special trains for the evacuation during the
period from 15 December 1942 to 10 January 1943 because of
the increased traffic of armed forces leave trains).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Composition: The 45,000 Jews are to consist of 30,000
Jews from the district of <span class='it'>Byalystock</span>. 10,000 Jews from
the Ghetto <span class='it'>Theresienstadt</span>, 5,000 of whom are Jews fit for
work who heretofore had been used for smaller jobs required
for the Ghetto, and 5,000 Jews who are generally incapable
<span class='pageno' title='955' id='Page_955'></span>
of working, also over 60 year old Jews * * *. As heretofore
only such Jews would be taken for the evacuation
who do not have any particular connections and who are
not in possession of any high decorations. 3,000 Jews from
the occupied Dutch territories, 2,000 Jews from Berlin—45,000.
The figure of 45,000 includes the invalid (old Jews
and children). <span class='it'>By use of a practical standard</span>, the screening
of the arriving Jews in Auschwitz should yield at least
10,000 to 15,000 people fit for work.” (<span class='it'>R-91</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Jews of Hungary suffered the same fate. Between 19
March 1944 and 1 August 1944 more than 400,000 Hungarian
Jews were rounded up. Many of these were put in wagons and
sent to extermination camps. An affidavit made in London by
Dr. Rudolph Kastner, a former official of the Hungarian Zionist
Organization, states in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“19 March 1944: Together with the German military occupation
arrived in Budapest a ‘Special Section Commando’
of the German Secret Police with the sole object of liquidating
the Hungarian Jews * * * They arrested and
later deported to Mauthausen, all the leaders of Jewish political
and business life and journalists, together with the Hungarian
democratic and anti-Fascist politicians * * *.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Up to 27 June 1944, 475,000 Jews were deported.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“According to statements of Krumey and Wislicseny in
February or March 1945 a conference of the officers of IV.B.
was called to Berlin by Eichmann in the spring of 1942. He
then informed them that the government decided in favor
of the complete annihilation of the European Jews and that
this will be carried out silently in the gas-chambers. ‘Victory
is ours,’ declared Eichmann. ‘The end of the war is
near. We must hurry as this is the last chance to free
Europe of the Jews. After the war it will not be possible
to utilize such methods.’ ”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Commanders of the death-camps gassed only on direct or
indirect instructions of Eichmann. The particular officer
of IV.B. who directed the deportations from some particular
country had the authority to indicate whether the train
should go to a death camp or not, and what should happen to
the passengers. The instructions were usually carried by
the SS-NCO escorting the train. The letters ‘A’ or ‘M’ on
the escorting instruction documents indicated Auschwitz or
<span class='pageno' title='956' id='Page_956'></span>
Majdanek; it meant that the passengers were to be gassed.
* * * Regarding Hungarian Jews the following general
ruling was laid down in Auschwitz: children up to the age of
12 or 14, older people above 50, as well as the sick, or people
with criminal records (who were transported in specially
marked wagons) were taken immediately on their arrival to
the gas chambers.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The others passed before an SS doctor who, on sight indicated
who was fit for work, and who was not. Those unfit
were sent to the gas chambers, while the others were distributed
in various labor camps.” (<span class='it'>2605-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>2. “CHARGES” AGAINST CONCENTRATION CAMP INMATES</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In the Eastern territories, these victims were apprehended for
extermination in concentration camps without any charges having
been made against them. In the Western occupied territories,
charges were apparently made against some of the victims. Some
of the charges which the Nazis considered sufficient basis for confinement
in a concentration camp are illustrated in a summary
of the file of the dossier of 25 persons arrested in Luxembourg
for commitment to various concentration camps and sets forth
the charges made against each person (<span class='it'>L-215</span>). These charges
read as follows:</p>

<h3><span class='pageno' title='957' id='Page_957'></span>3. USE OF CONCENTRATION CAMPS FOR PRISONERS OF WAR</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Not only civilians of the occupied territories, but also prisoners
of war were subjected to the concentration camp. A memorandum
to all officers of the State Police, signed by Mueller, Chief of the
Gestapo, dated 9 November 1941, discusses the “Transportation
of Russian Prisoners of War, Destined for Execution, into the
Concentration Camps.” (<span class='it'>1165-PS</span>). This memorandum states in
part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The commandants of the concentration camps are complaining
that 5 to 10% of the Soviet Russians destined for execution
are arriving in the camps dead or half dead. Therefore
the impression has arisen that the Stalags are getting
rid of such prisoners in this way.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It was particularly noted that, when marching, for example,
from the railroad station to the camp, a rather large number
of PWs collapsed on the way from exhaustion, either
dead or half dead, and had to be picked up by a truck following
the convoy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It cannot be prevented that the German people take notice
of these occurrences.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Even if the transportation to the camps is generally taken
care of by the Wehrmacht, the population will attribute this
situation to the SS.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In order to prevent, if possible, similar occurrences in the
future, I therefore order that, effective from today on, Soviet
Russians, declared definitely suspect and obviously
<span class='pageno' title='958' id='Page_958'></span>
marked by death (for example with typhus) and who therefore
would not be able to withstand the exertions of even a
short march on foot, shall in the future, as a matter of basic
principle, be excluded from the transport into the concentration
camps for execution.” (<span class='it'>1165-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Additional evidence of the confinement of Russian prisoners of
war in concentration camps is found in an official report of the
investigation of the Flossenburg concentration camp by Headquarters
Third United States Army, Judge Advocate Section,
War Crimes Branch, dated 21 June 1945 (<span class='it'>2309-PS</span>). This report
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In 1941 an additional stockade was added at the Flossenburg
Camp, to hold 2,000 Russian prisoners. From these
2,000 prisoners only 102 survived.” (<span class='it'>2309-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Soviet prisoners of war found their allies in the concentration
camps. The same official report continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The victims of Flossenburg included among the Russian,
civilians and prisoners of war, German nationals, Italians,
Belgians, Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, British and American
prisoners of war. No practical means was available to complete
a list of victims of this camp, however, since the foundation
of the camp in 1938 until the day of liberation it is estimated
that more than 29,000 inmates died.” (<span class='it'>2309-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Escaped prisoners of war were sent to concentration camps,
which were specially set up as extermination centers. A communication
from the Secret State Police Office, Cologne, dated
4 March 1944, transmitted the following orders of the OKW—for
which Keitel is responsible—concerning escaped prisoners of
war:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Every captured escaped prisoner of war who is an officer
or a non-working non-commissioned officer, except British
and American prisoners of war, is to be turned over to the
Chief of the Security Police and of the Security Service under
the classification ‘Step III’ regardless of whether the escape
occurred during a transport, whether it was a mass escape
or an individual one.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Since the transfer of the prisoners of war to the Security
Police and Security Service may not become officially known
to the outside under any circumstances other prisoners of
war may by no means be informed of the capture. The captured
prisoners are to be reported to the Army Information
Bureau as ‘escaped and not captured’. Their mail is to be
handled accordingly. Inquiries of representatives of the Protective
<span class='pageno' title='959' id='Page_959'></span>
Power of the International Red Cross, and of other
aid societies will be given the same answer.” (<span class='it'>1650-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The same communication carried a copy of an order of SS General
Mueller, acting for the Chief of the Security Police and SD,
which directed the Gestapo to transport escaped prisoners directly
to Mauthausen. The first two paragraphs of Mueller’s order
provide:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The State Police Directorates will accept the captured escaped
officer prisoners of war from the prisoner of war camp
commandants and will transport them to the Concentration
Camp Mauthausen following the procedure previously used,
unless the circumstances render a special transport imperative.
The prisoners of war are to be put in irons on the
transport—not on the station if it is subject to view by the
public. The camp commandant at Mauthausen is to be notified
that the transfer occurs within the scope of the action
‘Kugel’. The State Police Directorates will submit semi-yearly
reports on these transfers giving merely the figures,
the first report being due on 5 July 1944 (sharp). * * *
For the sake of secrecy, the Supreme Command of the Armed
Forces has been requested to inform the prisoner of war
camps to turn the captured prisoners over to the local State
Police Office and not to send them directly to Mauthausen.”
(<span class='it'>1650-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It is no coincidence that the literal translation for the German
word “<span class='it'>Kugel</span>” is “bullet”, since Mauthausen, where the escaped
prisoners were sent, was an extermination center.</p>

<h3>4. THE NETWORK OF CONCENTRATION CAMPS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Nazi conquest was marked by the establishment of concentration
camps over all of Europe. The following report on the location
of concentration camps, signed by Pohl, an SS General who
was in charge of concentration camp labor policies, indicates the
scope of these activities:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. At the outbreak of war there existed the following concentration
camps:</p>

<p class='noindent'>a Dachau, 1939, 4,000 prisoners, today 8,000.</p>

<p class='noindent'>b Sachsenhausen, 1939, 6,500 prisoners, today 10,000.</p>

<p class='noindent'>c Buchenwald, 1939, 5,300 prisoners, today 9,000.</p>

<p class='noindent'>d Mauthausen, 1939, 1,500 prisoners, today 5,500.</p>

<p class='noindent'>e Flossenburg, 1939, 1,600 prisoners, today 4,700.</p>

<p class='noindent'>f Ravensbrueck, 1939, 2,500 prisoners, today 7,500.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. In the years 1940 to 1942 nine further camps were
<span class='pageno' title='960' id='Page_960'></span>
erected, viz.:</p>

<p class='noindent'>a. Auschwitz (Poland)</p>

<p class='noindent'>b. Neuengamme</p>

<p class='noindent'>c. Gusen (Austria)</p>

<p class='noindent'>d. Natzweiler (France)</p>

<p class='noindent'>e. Gross-Rosen</p>

<p class='noindent'>f. Lublin (Poland)</p>

<p class='noindent'>g. Niederhagen</p>

<p class='noindent'>h. Stutthof (near Danzig)</p>

<p class='noindent'>i. Arbeitsdorf.” (<span class='it'>R-129</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In addition to these camps in occupied territory, there were
many others. The official report by the Headquarters, Third
U. S. Army, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Branch, contains
the following evidence:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Concentration Camp Flossenburg was founded in 1938 as
a camp for political prisoners. Construction was commenced
on the camp in 1938 and it was not until April 1940
that the first transport of prisoners was received. From
this time on prisoners began to flow steadily into the camp.
* * * Flossenburg was the mother camp and under its
direct control and jurisdiction were 47 satellite camps or
outer-commandos for male prisoners and 27 camps for
female workers. To these outer-commandos were supplied
the necessary prisoners for the various work projects undertaken.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Of all these outer-commandos Hersbruck and Leitmeritz (in
Czechoslovakia), Oberstaubling, Mulsen and Sall, located on
the Danube, were considered to be the worst.” (<span class='it'>2309-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>5. THE CONCENTRATION CAMP AS AN INSTRUMENT OF TERROR</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The savage treatment which was inflicted in these concentration
camps upon allied nationals, prisoners of war, and other
victims of Nazi terror has been depicted in motion picture evidence.
Verbal discussion of this subject may therefore be brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minutes of the Central Planning Committee, on which
Speer sat, and where the high strategy of Nazi armament production
was formulated, record a conference on the question of
squeezing more work out of slave laborers. Speer, who was
not generally considered a fanatic like Frick, or a man of Blood
and Iron like Goering, handled the problem in this fashion:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Speer: We must also discuss the slackers. Ley has ascertained
that the sick list decreased to one-fourth or one-fifth
in factories where doctors are on the staff who are examining
<span class='pageno' title='961' id='Page_961'></span>
the sick men. There is nothing to be said against SS
and Police taking drastic steps and putting those known as
slackers into concentration camps. There is no alternative.
Let it happen several times and the news will soon go
around.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The deterrent effect of the concentration camps upon the public
was carefully planned. To heighten the atmosphere of terror
surrounding the concentration camps, they were shrouded in
secrecy. What went on behind the barbed wire enclosures was a
matter of fearful conjecture in Germany and the countries under
Nazi control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the policy from the very beginning, when the Nazis
first came into power in Germany and set up their concentration
camp system. An order issued in 1 October 1933 by the Camp
Commander of Dachau prescribes a program of floggings, solitary
confinement, and executions for the inmates for infractions of
the rules. (<span class='it'>778-PS</span>) Among the rules were those prescribing
a rigid censorship concerning conditions within the camp:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“By virture of the law on revolutionaries, the following offenders,
considered as <span class='it'>agitators, will be hung</span>. Anyone who,
for the purpose of agitating, does the following in the camp,
at work, in the quarters, in the kitchens and workshops, toilets
and places of rest: politicizes, holds inciting speeches and
meetings, forms cliques, loiters around with others; who for
the purpose of supplying the propaganda of the opposition
with atrocity stories, collects true or false information about
the concentration camp and its institution; receives such information,
buries it, talks about it to others, smuggles it out
of the camp into the hands of foreign visitors or others by
means of clandestine or other methods, passes it on in writing
or orally to released prisoners or prisoners who are placed
above them, conceals it in clothing or other articles, throws
stones and other objects over the camp wall containing such
information; or produces secret documents; who, for the purpose
of agitating, climbs on barracks’ roofs and trees, seeks
contact with the outside by giving light or other signals, or
induces others to escape or commit a crime, gives them advices
to that effect or supports such undertakings in any way
whatsover.” (<span class='it'>778-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Censorship concerning the camps was complemented by an officially
inspired rumor campaign outside the camps. Concentration
camps were spoken of in whispers, and the whispers were
spread by agents of the secret police. A “Top Secret” order, relating
<span class='pageno' title='962' id='Page_962'></span>
to concentration camps, issued by the Head of the Gestapo
and distributed to appropriate police officers, and dated 26 October
1939, provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In order to achieve a further deterrent effect, the following
must, in future, be observed in each individual case * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. <span class='it'>The length of the period of custody must in no case be
made known</span>, even if the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the
German Police or the Chief of the Security Police and the SD
has already fixed it.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The term of commitment to a concentration camp is to be
openly announced as ‘until further notice.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In most serious cases, there is no objection to the increasing
of the deterrent effect by the spreading of cleverly carried
out <span class='it'>rumour propaganda</span>, more or less to the effect that,
according to hearsay, in view of the seriousness of his case,
the arrested man will not be released for 2 or 3 years.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. In certain cases, the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the
German Police will order flogging in addition to detention in
a concentration camp. Orders of this kind will, in future,
also be transmitted to the State Police District Office concerned.
In this case too, there is no objection to spreading
the rumor of this increased punishment as laid down in Section
3, paragraph 3, in so far as this appears suitable, to
add to the deterrent effect.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“5. Naturally, particularly suitable and reliable people are
to be chosen for the spreading of such news.” (<span class='it'>1531-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>6. THE TREATMENT OF CONCENTRATION CAMP VICTIMS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The deterrent effect of the concentration camps was based on
the promise of savage brutality. This promise was fulfilled, to
an extent which defies description. Once in the custody of the SS
guards, the victim was beaten, tortured, starved, and often murdered
through the so-called “extermination through work” program,
or through mass execution gas chambers and furnaces of
the camps (which were portrayed in the motion picture evidence).
The reports of official government investigations furnish
additional evidence of conditions within the concentration camps.
The official report concerning the concentration camp Flossenberg,
prefaced by the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the
United States Army, dated 21 June 1945, and supported by attached
affidavits and testimony, contains this description:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The work at these camps mainly consisted of underground
labor, the purpose being the construction of large underground
<span class='pageno' title='963' id='Page_963'></span>
factories, storage rooms, etc. This labor was performed
completely underground and as a result of the brutal
treatment, working and living conditions, a daily average of
100 prisoners died. To the one camp Oberstaubling, 700
prisoners were transported in February 1945 and on the 15th
of April 1945 only 405 of these men were living. During the
12 months preceding the liberation, Flossenburg and the
branch camps under its control accounted for the death of
14,739 male inmates and 1,300 women. These figures represent
the deaths as were obtained from the available records
in the camp, however, they are in no way complete as many
secret mass executions and deaths took place. In 1941 an additional
stockade was added at the Flossenburg camp, to hold
2,000 Russian prisoners. From these 2,000 prisoners only
102 survived.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Flossenburg Concentration Camp can best be described as
a factory dealing in death. Although this camp had in view
the primary object of putting to work the mass slave labor,
another of its primary objectives was the elimination of human
lives by the methods employed in handling the prisoners.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Hunger and starvation rations, sadism, housing facilities,
inadequate clothing, medical neglect, disease, beatings, hangings,
freezing, hand hanging, forced suicides, shooting, all
played a major role in obtaining their objective. Prisoners
were murdered at random; spite killings against Jews were
common. Injections of poison and shooting in the neck were
everyday occurrences. Epidemics of typhus and spotted fever
were permitted to run rampant as a means of eliminating
prisoners. Life in this camp meant nothing. Killing became
a common thing, so common that a quick death was welcomed
by the unfortunate ones.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On Christmas 1944 a number of prisoners were hung at one
time. The prisoners were forced to view this hanging. By
the side of the gallows was a decorated Christmas tree and
as expressed by one prisoner ‘it was a terrible sight, that
combination of prisoners hanging in the air and the glistening
Christmas tree’.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In March or April, 13 American or British parachutists
were hung. They had been delivered to this camp sometime
before and had been captured while trying to blow up
bridges.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On April 20, 1945, approximately 15,000 prisoners were assembled
<span class='pageno' title='964' id='Page_964'></span>
to make a forced march in the direction of Concentration
Camp Dachau. The evacuation of these prisoners
was caused by the impending capture of the camp by the
Allies. These 15,000 prisoners were lined up in three groups
and started on this march. Only those prisoners who could
walk were taken and before leaving Flossenburg, many were
executed, as also were those who collapsed in rank awaiting
the movement to start the trek. No provision was made for
the feeding of these prisoners or sleeping on this trip. They
marched in long columns guarded by SS Guards.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Thousands were killed on the way and the paths which they
took were littered with the dead. Groups of from 5 to 50
were taken out and forced to dig pits and then were shot.
Many graves were not even covered. As the already starved
and weakened prisoners fell from exhaustion, a group of
SS guards bringing up the rear would kill them by a shot in
the back of the head. All who fell out of line were immediately
executed in this manner. Death was also caused by
beatings or bashings in the skulls.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The prisoners marched from Friday till Monday during
which time they received only 100 grams of bread. They
marched in the rain and slept in the fields in the mud and
water. Many died from exhaustion. On the 23rd day of
April 1945, between the towns of Cham and Roding, they
were liberated by the American troops.” (<span class='it'>2309-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Conditions at Mauthausen, one of the most notorious extermination
centers, are thus described in an official report of the
office of the Judge Advocate General of the Third United States
Army, dated 17 June 1945:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“V. <span class='it'>Conclusions.</span> There is no doubt that Mauthausen was
the basis for long term planning. It was constructed as a
gigantic stone fortress on top of a mountain flanked by small
barracks.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Mauthausen, in addition to its permanency of construction
had facilities for a large garrison of officers and men, and
had large dining rooms and toilet facilities for the staff.
It was conducted with the sole purpose in mind of exterminating
any so-called prisoner who entered within its walls.
The so-called branches of Mauthausen were under direct
command of the SS officials located there. All records, orders,
and administrative facilities were handled for these
branches through Mauthausen. The other camps, including
Gusen and Ebensee, its two most notorious and largest
branches, were not exclusively used for extermination but
<span class='pageno' title='965' id='Page_965'></span>
prisoners were used as tools in construction and production
until they were beaten or starved into uselessness, whereupon
they were customarily sent to Mauthausen for final
disposal.” (<span class='it'>2176-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear from both the motion picture and these reports,
which could be supplemented by many similar ones, that the
brutal conditions in all concentration camps followed the same
general pattern. The widespread incidence of these conditions
makes it clear that they were not the result of sporadic excesses
on the part of individual jailers, but were the result of policies
deliberately imposed from above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crimes committed by the Nazis in the concentration camp
were on so vast a scale that individual atrocities pale into insignificance.
But there are two exhibits in the possession of the
prosecution which illustrate the contempt in which the Nazis
held human values. The first is a frame showing sections of
human skin, taken from human bodies in Buchenwald Concentration
Camp and preserved as ornaments. (This was offered
by the prosecution as a physical exhibit.) They were selected
because of the tattooing which appeared on the skin. Attached
to this exhibit is an extract of an official U. S. Army report
describing the circumstances under which this exhibit was obtained

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Preamble.</span> The author of this account is PW Andreas
Pfaffenberger, 1 Coy, 9 Landesschuetzen Bn. 43 years old
and of limited education, he is a butcher by trade. The
substantial agreement of the details of his story with those
found in PWIS (H)/LF/736 establishes the validity of his
testimony.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“PW has not been questioned on statements which, in the
light of what is known, are apparently erroneous in certain
details, nor has any effort been made to alter the subjective
character of PW’s account, which he wrote without being
told anything of the intelligence already known. Results of
interrogation on personalities at Buchenwald have already
been published (PWIB No 2/12 Item 31).”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In 1939, all prisoners with tattooing on them were ordered
<span class='pageno' title='966' id='Page_966'></span>
to report to the dispensary. No one knew what the purpose
was. But after the tattooed prisoners had been examined,
the ones with the best and most artistic specimens were kept
in the dispensary, and then killed by injections, administered
by Karl Beigs, a criminal prisoner. The corpses were then
turned over to the pathological department, where the desired
pieces of tattooed skin were detached from the bodies
and treated. The finished products were turned over to SS
Standartenfuehrer Koch’s wife, who had them fashioned into
lampshades and other ornamental household articles. I myself
saw such tattooed skins with various designs and legends
on them, such as “Hans’l und Gret’l”, which one prisoner
had had on his knee, and ships from prisoners’ chests. This
work was done by a prisoner named Wernerbach.” (<span class='it'>3420-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>The following certificate is also attached to the exhibit:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I, George C. Demas, Lieut., USNR., associated with the
United States Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis
Criminality, hereby certify that the attached exhibit, consisting
of parchment, was delivered by the War Crimes Section,
Judge Advocate General, U. S. Army, to me in my above
capacity, in the usual course of official business, as an exhibit
found in Buchenwald Camp and captured by military
forces under the command of the Supreme Commander, Allied
Expeditionary Forces.” (<span class='it'>3421-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This is the conclusion reached in an official U. S. Army report
attached to the exhibit:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Based on the findings in paragraph 2, all three specimens
are tattooed human skin”. (<span class='it'>3423-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>One more example of this pathological phase of Nazi culture,
another Nazi trophy, is a human head with the skull bone removed,
shrunken, stuffed, and preserved. (This was offered by
the prosecution as a physical exhibit.) This head probably belonged
to a foreign worker, kidnapped by Sauckel to work in
Speer’s armament industry. The Nazis had one of their many
victims decapitated after having had him hanged for fraternizing
with a German woman; they fashioned this ornament from
his head. This represents the end product of the Nazi system,
representing both the degradation of the Nazi “master” and the
anguish of his victim. The official U. S. Army report attached to
this exhibit deals with the manner in which this exhibit was acquired.
It reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“There I also saw the shrunken heads of two young Poles
who had been hanged for having relations with German girls.
<span class='pageno' title='967' id='Page_967'></span>
The heads were the size of a fist, and the hair and the marks
of the rope were still there.” (<span class='it'>3423-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>7. THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>No accurate estimate of how many persons died in the concentration
camps can be made. Although the Nazis were generally
meticulous record keepers, the records they kept about concentration
camps appear to have been incomplete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Occasionally there is a death book, or a set of index cards, but
for the most part, the victims apparently faded into an unrecorded
death. The scale of the concentration camp operations is suggested
by a set of seven books, the death ledger of the Mauthausen
Concentration Camp (physically offered to the court).
Each book bears on its cover “<span class='it'>Totenbuch</span>” or Death Book—Mauthausen.
In these books were recorded the names of some of the
inmates who died or were murdered in this camp. The books
cover the period from January 1939 to April 1945. They give the
name, place of birth, the assigned cause of death and time of
death of each individual recorded. In addition each corpse is assigned
a serial number. Addition of the serial numbers for the
five-year period produces a total figure of 35,318.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Examination of the books reveals the camp’s routine of death.
For example, pages 568 to 582 of Volume 5 cover death entries
made for 19 March 1945 between fifteen minutes past one in the
morning until 2 o’clock in the afternoon. In this space of 12¾
hours, 203 persons are reported as having died. They were assigned
serial numbers running from 8390 to 8593. The names of
the dead are listed. The victims are all recorded as having died
of the same ailment—“heart trouble”. They died at brief intervals.
They died in alphabetical order. The first who died was a
man named Ackermann who died at one fifteen A.M. The last
was a man named Zynger who died at 2 o’clock P.M.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At twenty minutes past two o’clock on the afternoon of the
same day, 19 March 1945, the fatal roll call began again, and continued
until half past four o’clock. In a space of two hours, 75
more persons died. Once again they died from heart failure and
in alphabetical order. The entries are recorded in the same volume,
from pages 582 through 586.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another death book was found at Camp Mauthausen. This is
a single volume, which has on its cover the words—“Death Book—Prisoners
of War”. Pages 234 through 246 contain entries
recording the names of 208 prisoners of war, apparently Russians,
who at 15 minutes past midnight on the 10th day of May 1942,
<span class='pageno' title='968' id='Page_968'></span>
were executed at the same time. The book notes that the execution
was directed by the Chief of the SD and the SIPO (Heydrich).</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is common knowledge that the anguish of the concentration
camp was spread, not only over the Continent of Europe, but over
all the world. Even today all over the world people are still seeking
word of their friends and relatives who vanished into the
Nazi concentration camps and left no trace behind. This fact is
emphasized by the 23 November 1945 issue of the weekly newspaper,
“<span class='it'>Aufbau</span>”, published in the German language in New York
City. On the back pages—8, 9, 10, and 11—are published both
notices requesting information about friends and relatives, and
notices announcing the deaths of persons who were last heard of
in a Nazi concentration camp. The personal tragedies, which these
notices represent, multiplied an incalculable number of times, is
part of the legacy which the Nazi conspirators have left to the
world.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='978' id='Page_978'></span><h1>Chapter XII<br/> THE PERSECUTION OF THE JEWS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It had long been a German theory that the First World War
ended in Germany’s defeat because of a collapse behind the lines.
In planning for future wars it was determined that the home
front must be secured to prevent a repetition of this 1918 debacle.
Unification of the German people was essential to successful planning
and waging of war. Hence, the Nazi political goal must be
sought:—“One race, one State, one Fuehrer.” Free trade unions
must be abolished, political parties (other than the NSDAP) must
be outlawed, civil liberties must be suspended, and opposition of
every kind must be swept away. Loyalty to God, church, and
scientific truth was declared to be incompatible with the Nazi
regime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The anti-Jewish policy was part of this plan for unification
because it was the conviction of the Nazis that the Jews would
not contribute to Germany’s military program, but on the contrary
would hamper it. The Jew must therefore be eliminated.
This view is clearly borne out by a statement contained in a
speech of Himmler’s at a meeting of SS Major Generals on 4 October
1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We know how difficult we should have made it for ourselves
if with the bombing raids, the burdens and deprivations of
war, we still had the Jews today in every town as secret saboteurs,
agitators, and trouble-mongers; we would now probably
have reached the 1916-17 stage when the Jews were still
in the German national body.” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The treatment of the Jews within Germany was as much a part
of the Nazi plan for aggressive war as was the building of armaments
and the conscription of manpower.</p>

<h3>1. HATE-PROPAGANDA AGAINST JEWS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The objective of the elimination and extermination of the Jews,
could not be accomplished without certain preliminary measures.
One of these was the indoctrination of the German people with
hatred against the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first evidence of the Party policies in this direction was
expressed in the Party program of February 1920 (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>).
Paragraphs (4) and (6) of that program declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Only a member of the race can be a citizen. A
member of the race can only be one who is of German blood
without consideration of confession.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='979' id='Page_979'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The right to determine matters concerning administration
and law belongs only to the citizen; therefore, we
demand that every public office of any sort whatsoever,
whether in the Reich, the county or municipality, be filled
only by citizens.” (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Hitler, at page 724 and 725 of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, spoke of the Jew.
If the National Socialist movement was to fulfill its task, he declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It must open the eyes of the people with regard to foreign
nations and must remind them again and again of the true
enemy of our present day world. In the place of hate against
Aryans—from whom we may be separated by almost everything,
to whom, however, we are tied by common blood or
the great tide of a common culture—it must dedicate to the
general anger the evil enemy of mankind as the true cause
of all suffering.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It must see to it, however, that at least in our country he
be recognized as the most mortal enemy and that the struggle
against him may show, like a flaming beacon of a better era,
to other nations too, the road to salvation for a struggling
Aryan mankind.” (<span class='it'>2662-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A flood of abusive literature of all types and for all age groups
was published and circulated throughout Germany. Illustrative
of this type of publication is the book <span class='it'>Der Giftpilz</span>. (<span class='it'>1778-PS</span>).
This book brands the Jew as a persecutor of the labor class, a race
defiler, a devil in human form, a poisonous mushroom, and a murderer.
This particular book was used to instruct school children
to recognize the Jew by caricatures of his physical features,
(pages 6 and 7); and to teach them that the Jew abuses little
boys and girls, (page 30), and that the Jewish Bible permits all
crimes (pages 13-17). Streicher’s periodical, <span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>, (issue
no. 14 for April 1937) in particular, went to such extremes as to
publish the statement that Jews at the ritual celebration of their
Passover slaughtered Christians:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The numerous confessions made by the Jews show that the
execution of ritual murders is a law to the Talmud Jew. The
former chief rabbi, and later monk, Teofite, declared that the
ritual murders take place especially on the Jewish Purim in
memory of the Persian murders, and Passover in memory
of the murder of Christ. The instructions are as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The blood of the victims is to be tapped by force. On Passover
it is to be used in wine and matzos. Thus, a small part
of the blood is to be poured into the dough of the matzos
<span class='pageno' title='980' id='Page_980'></span>
and into the wine. The mixing is done by the Jewish head
of the family. The procedure is as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The family head empties a few drops of the fresh and
powdered blood into the glass, wets the fingers of the left
hand with it and sprays, blesses, with it everything on the
table. The head of the family then says, ‘Thus we ask God
to send the ten plagues to all enemies of the Jewish faith.’
Then they eat, and at the end the head of the family exclaims,
‘May all Gentiles perish, as the child whose blood is
contained in the bread and wine.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The fresh, or dried and powdered blood of the slaughtered
is further used by young married Jewish couples, by pregnant
Jewesses, for circumcision and so on. Ritual murder
is recognized by all Talmud Jews. The Jew believes he absolves
himself thus of his sins.” (<span class='it'>2699-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Jew-baiting publication, <span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>, was published by
Streicher’s publishing firm (<span class='it'>2697-PS</span>). In one issue of this periodical,
Streicher, speaking of the Jewish faith, said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Holy Scripture is a horrible criminal romance abounding
with murder, incest, fraud and indecency.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Talmud is the great Jewish book of crimes that the
Jew practices in his daily life.” (<span class='it'>2698-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This propaganda campaign of hate, of which the above quotations
are but random samples, was too widespread and notorious
to require further elaboration.</p>

<h3>2. DISCRIMINATORY DECREES AGAINST JEWS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>When the Nazi Party gained control of the German State, the
conspirators used the means of official decrees as a weapon
against the Jews. In this way the force of the state was applied
against them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jewish immigrants were denaturalized (1933 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 480, signed by Frick and Neurath).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Native Jews were precluded from citizenship (1935 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 1146, signed by Frick).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jews were forbidden to live in marriage or to have extra-marital
relations with persons of German blood (1935 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 1146, signed by Frick and Hess).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jews were denied the right to vote (1936 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 133, signed by Frick).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jews were denied the right to hold public office or civil service
<span class='pageno' title='981' id='Page_981'></span>
positions (1933 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 277, signed by
Frick).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jews were relegated to an inferior status by the denial of common
privileges and freedoms. Thus, they were denied access to
certain city areas, sidewalks, transportation, places of amusement,
restaurants (1938 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 1676).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Progressively, more and more stringent measures were applied,
even to the denial of private pursuits. They were excluded
from the practice of dentistry (1939 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I,
page 47, signed by Hess).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The practice of law was denied to them (1938 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 1403, signed by Frick and Hess).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The practice of medicine was forbidden them (1938 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 969, signed by Frick and Hess).</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were denied employment by press and radio (1933
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 661).</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were excluded from stock exchanges and stock brokerage
(1934 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 661).</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were excluded from farming (1933 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 685).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1938 they were excluded from business in general and from
the economic life of Germany (1938 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I,
page 1580, signed by Goering).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Jews were also forced to pay discriminatory taxes and
huge atonement fines. Their homes, bank accounts, real estate,
and intangibles were expropriated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A report of a conference under the chairmanship of Goering,
and attended by Funk, among others, which was held at 11
o’clock on 12 November 1938 at the Reich Ministry for Air,
quotes Goering as saying:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“One more question, gentlemen, what would you think the
situation would be if I’d announced today that Jewry shall
have to contribute this one billion as a punishment.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I shall choose the wording this way that German Jewry
shall, as punishment for their abominable crimes, etc., etc.,
have to make a contribution of one billion; that’ll work.
The pigs won’t commit another murder. I’d like to say
again that I would not like to be a Jew in Germany.”
(<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Following these whimsical remarks a decree was issued over the
signature of Goering, fining German Jews the sum of one
billion Reichsmarks (1938 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 1579,
dated 12 November 1938, signed by Goering).
<span class='pageno' title='982' id='Page_982'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Similar decrees are contained in 1939 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part
I, page 282, signed by Goering; and in 1941 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 722, signed by Frick and Bormann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, in 1943, the Jews were placed beyond the protection
of any judicial process by a decree signed by Bormann and
Frick, among others; the police were made the sole arbiters of
punishment and death (1943 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 372,
signed by Frick and Bormann).</p>

<h3>3. ANTI-JEWISH BOYCOTTS, RAIDS, AND VIOLENCE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Simultaneously with the passage of these decrees and their execution,
still another weapon was wielded by the Party and the
party-controlled state. This was the openly sponsored and official
anti-Jewish boycotts. The published diary of Joseph Goebbels,
at page 290, contains this entry for 29 March 1933:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The boycott appeal is approved by the entire cabinet.”
(<span class='it'>2409-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Again, on 31 March 1933, he wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We are having a last discussion among a very small circle
and decide that the boycott is to start tomorrow with all severity.”
(<span class='it'>2409-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher and Frank, together with Himmler, Ley, and others,
were members of a central committee who conducted the 1933
boycott against the Jews. Their names are listed in National
Socialist Party correspondence for 29 March 1933. (<span class='it'>2156-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this early 1933 violence against the Jews, raids were conducted
on synagogues by uniformed Nazis. Attending members
of the synagogues were assaulted, and religious insignia and emblems
were desecrated. A report of such an occurrence was contained
in an official dispatch from the American Consul General
in Leipzig, dated 5 April, 1943, which stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In Dresden several weeks ago uniformed Nazis raided the
Jewish prayer house, interrupted the evening religious service,
arrested 25 worshippers, and tore the holy insignia or
emblems from their headcovering worn while praying.”
(<span class='it'>2709-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At a meeting in Nurnberg, before the representatives of the
German press, Streicher and Mayor Liebel of Nurnberg revealed
in advance to the gathered members of the press that the Nurnberg
synagogue was to be destroyed. The minutes of this meeting,
dated 4 August 1938, read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“The breaking up of the synagogue</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>(information must still be secret)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On August 10, 1938 at 10 o’clock a. m., the breakup of the
<span class='pageno' title='983' id='Page_983'></span>
synagogues will commence. Gauleiter Julius Streicher will
personally set the crane into motion with which the Jewish
symbols, Star of David, etc., will be torn down. This should
be arranged in a big way. Closer details are still unknown.”
(<span class='it'>1724-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher himself supervised the demolition, according to a
newspaper account of 11 August 1938, which described the scene:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In Nurnberg the Synagogue is being demolished; Julius
Streicher himself inaugurates the work by a speech lasting
more than an hour and a half. By his order then—so to
speak as a prelude of the demolition—the tremendous Star
of David came off the cupola.” (<span class='it'>2711-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These accounts of violence were not localized anti-Semitic demonstrations,
but were directed and ordered from a centralized
headquarters in Berlin. This fact is established by a series of
teletype messages sent by the Berlin Secret State Police Headquarters
to police chiefs throughout Germany on 10 November
1938, which contained instructions pertaining to the prearranged
demonstration (<span class='it'>3051-PS</span>). One of these confidential orders,
signed by Heydrich, provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Because of the attempt on the life of the Secretary of the
Legation von Rath in Paris tonight, 9-10 November 1938,
demonstrations against Jews are to be expected throughout
the Reich. The following instructions are given on how to
treat these events:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The Chiefs of the State Police, or their deputies, must
get in telephonic contact with the political leaders who have
jurisdiction over their districts and have to arrange a joint
meeting with the appropriate inspector or commander of the
Order Police to discuss the organization of the demonstrations.
At these discussions the political leaders have to be
informed that the German police has received from the
Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police the following
instructions, in accordance with which the political
leaders should adjust their own measures.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> Only such measures should be taken which do not involve
danger to German life or property. (For instance
synagogues are to be burned down only when there is no
danger of fire to the surroundings.)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> Business and private apartments of Jews may be destroyed
but not looted. The police is instructed to supervise
the execution of this order and to arrest looters.” (<span class='it'>3051-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='984' id='Page_984'></span></p>

<h3>4. THE PROGRAM FOR THE COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF JEWRY</h3>

<p class='pindent'>At this point the gradual and mounting campaign against the
Jews was prepared for the achievement of its ultimate violent
ends. The German people had been indoctrinated, and the seeds
of hatred had been sown. The German state was armed and prepared
for conquest. The force of world opinion could now safely
be ignored. Already the Nazi conspirators had forced out of
Germany 200,000 of its former 500,000 Jews. The Nazi-controlled
German state was therefore emboldened, and Hitler in anticipation
of the aggressive wars already planned cast about for a provocation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his speech before the Reichstag on 30 January 1939, Hitler
declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If the international Jewish financiers within and without
Europe succeed in plunging the nations once more into a
world war, the result will not be the Bolshevication of the
world and the victory of Jewry, but the obliteration of the
Jewish race in Europe.” (<span class='it'>2663-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The chief editor of the official organ of the SS, the “<span class='it'>Schwarze
Korps</span>,” expressed similar sentiments on 8 August 1940:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Just as the Jewish question will be solved for Germany only
when the last Jew has been deported, so the rest of Europe
should also realize that the German peace which awaits it
must be a peace without Jews.” (<span class='it'>2668-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Other officials of the Party and State voiced the same views.
Rosenberg wrote for the publication “World Struggle,” which in
the April and September 1941 issues declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jewish question will be solved for Europe only when
the last Jew has left the European continent.” (<span class='it'>2665-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hans Frank entered this apologetic note in his diary:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Of course, I could not eliminate all lice and Jews in only a
year’s time. But in the course of time, and above all, if you
will help me, this end will be attained.” (<span class='it'>2233-C-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Registration.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The first step in accomplishing the purpose of the Nazi Party
and the Nazi-dominated state, to eliminate the Jew, was to require
a complete registration of all Jews. Inasmuch as the anti-Jewish
policy was linked with the program of German aggression,
such registration was required not only within the Reich, but
successively within the conquered territories. For example, registration
was required, by decree, within Germany (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>
Part I, 1938, page 922, 23 July, signed by Frick); within
<span class='pageno' title='985' id='Page_985'></span>
Austria (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Volume 1, 1940, page 694, 29
April); within Poland (<span class='it'>Kurjer Krakowski</span>, 24 October, 1939); in

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>Segregation into Ghettos.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The second step was to segregate and concentrate the Jews
within restricted areas, called ghettos. This policy was carefully
worked out, as is illustrated by the confidential statement taken
from the files of Rosenberg (<span class='it'>212-PS</span>). This memorandum of
Rosenberg’s, entitled “Directions for Handling of the Jewish Question”,
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The first main goal of the German measures must be strict
segregation of Jewry from the rest of the population. In the
execution of this, first of all, is the seizing of the Jewish
population by the introduction of a registration order and
similar appropriate measures * * *.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * All rights of freedom for Jews are to be withdrawn.
They are to be placed in ghettos and at the same
time are to be separated according to sexes. The presence
of many more or less closed Jewish settlements in White
Ruthenia and in the Ukraine makes this mission easier. Moreover,
places are to be chosen which make possible the full use
of the Jewish manpower in case labor needs are present.
These ghettos can be placed under the supervision of a Jewish
self-government with Jewish officials. The guarding of
the boundaries between the ghettos and the outer world, is,
however, the duty of the Police.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Also, in the cases in which a ghetto could not yet be established,
care is to be taken through strict prohibitions and
similar suitable measures that a further intermingling of
blood of the Jews and the rest of the populace does not continue.”
(<span class='it'>212-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In May 1941 Rosenberg, as the Reich Minister for the Occupied
Eastern Territories, issued directions confining the Jews to
ghettos in the Ukraine:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“After the customary removal of Jews from all public offices,
the Jewish question will have to have a decisive solution,
through the institution of ghettos.” (<span class='it'>1028-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The policies set forth in the foregoing utterances of Rosenberg
were not accidental, isolated, or the views of one individual.
They were the expressed State policies. Von Schirach played his
<span class='pageno' title='986' id='Page_986'></span>
part in the program of ghettoization. His speech before the
European Youth Congress held in Vienna on 14 September 1942
was reported on page 2, column 2 of the Vienna edition of the
“<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>” of 15 September, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Every Jew who exerts influence in Europe is a danger to
European culture. If anyone reproaches me with having
driven from this city, which was once the European metropolis
of Jewry, tens of thousands upon tens of thousands
of Jews into the ghetto of the East, I feel myself compelled
to reply: I see in this an action contributing to European
culture.” (<span class='it'>3048-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>One of the largest ghettos was within the city of Warsaw.
The official report made by SS Major General Stroop concerning
this ghetto is entitled “The Warsaw Ghetto Is No More.”
(<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report thus describes the ghetto:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Ghetto thus established in Warsaw was inhabited by
about 400,000 Jews. It contained 27,000 apartments with
an average of 2½ rooms each. It was separated from the
rest of the city by partition and other walls, and by walling-up
of the thoroughfares, windows, doors, open spaces, etc.
* * *” (<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Conditions within this ghetto are indicated in the statement
of the report that an average of six persons lived in every room.
(<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Himmler received a report from the SS Brigade Fuehrer
Group A, dated 15 October 1941, which further illustrates the
establishment and operation of the ghettos. (<span class='it'>L-180</span>) The report
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Apart from organizing and carrying out measures of execution,
the creation of ghettos was begun in the larger
towns at once during the first day of operations. This was
especially urgent in Knowno because there were 30,000 Jews
in a total population of 152,400.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In Riga the so-called ‘<span class='it'>Moskau Suburb</span>’ was designated as
a ghetto. This is the worst dwelling district of Riga, already
now mostly inhabited by Jews. The transfer of the Jews
into the ghetto district proved rather difficult because the
Latvians dwelling in that district had to be evacuated and
residential space in Riga is very crowded. 24,000 of the
28,000 Jews living in Riga have been transferred into the
ghetto so far. In creating the ghetto, the Security Police
restricted themselves to mere policing duties, while the establishment
<span class='pageno' title='987' id='Page_987'></span>
and administration of the ghetto as well as the
regulation of the food supply for the inmates of the ghetto
were left to civil administration; the labor officers were left
in charge of Jewish labor.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the other towns with a larger Jewish population ghettos
shall be established likewise.” (<span class='it'>L-180</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jews were forced into ghettos in the Polish Province of Galicia.
The conditions in these ghettos are described in the report from
Katzmann, Lt. General of Police, to Krueger, General of the Police
East, dated 20 June 1943, and entitled “Solution of Jewish
Question in Galicia.” (<span class='it'>L-18</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Nothing but catastrophical conditions were found in the
ghettos of Rawa-Ruska and Rohatyn * * *.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The Jews of Rawa-Ruska, fearing the evacuation,
had concealed those suffering from spotted fever in underground
holes. When evacuation was to start the police found
that 3,000 Jews suffering from spotted fever lay about in
this ghetto. In order to destroy this center of pestilence at
once every police officer inoculated against spotted fever was
called into action. Thus we succeeded to destroy this plague-boil,
losing thereby only one officer. Almost the same conditions
were found in Rohatyn * * *.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Since we received more and more alarming reports on the
Jews becoming armed in an ever-increasing manner, we
started during the last fortnight in June 1943 an action
throughout the whole of the district of Galicia with the intent
to use strongest measures to destroy the Jewish gangsterdom.
Special measures were found necessary during the
action to dissolve the ghetto in Lwow where the dug-out
mentioned above had been established. Here we had to act
brutally from the beginning, in order to avoid losses on our
side; we had to blow up, or to burn down several houses. On
this occasion the surprising fact arose that we were able to
catch about 20,000 Jews instead of 12,000 Jews who had
registered. We had to pull at least 3,000 Jewish corpses out
of every kind of hiding places; they had committed suicide
by taking poison. * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Despite the extraordinary burden heaped upon
every single SS-Police officer during these actions, mood and
<span class='pageno' title='988' id='Page_988'></span>
spirit of the men were extraordinarily good and praiseworthy
from the first to the last day * * *.” (<span class='it'>L-18</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These acts of removal and slaughter were not entirely without
profit. The report continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Together with the evacuation action, we executed the confiscation
of Jewish property. Very high amounts were confiscated
and paid over to the Special Staff ‘Reinhard’. Apart

were confiscated and turned over to Special Staff ‘Reinhard’

<p class='noindent'>The thoroughness of the looting is illustrated by an item listing
11.73 kilograms of gold teeth and inlays. (<span class='it'>L-18</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the end of 1942, Jews in the General Government of Poland
had been crowded into fifty-five localities, whereas before the German
invasion there had been approximately 1,000 Jewish settlements
within this same area. This fact is reported in the 1942
Official Gazette for the General Government, No. 94, page 665,
1 November 1942.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Forced Labor.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Jews, having been registered and confined within the ghettos,
now furnished a reservoir for slave labor. The difference
between slave labor and “labor duty” was this: the latter group
were entitled to reasonable compensation, stated working hours,
medical care and attention, and other social security measures,
while the former were granted none of these advantages, being
in fact, on a level below that of slaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg set up within his organization for the Occupied
Eastern Territories a department which, among other things,
was to seek a solution for the Jewish problem by means of forced
labor. His plans, contained in a memorandum entitled “General
Organizations and Tasks of our Office for the General Handling
of Problems in the Eastern Territory,” and dated 29 April 1941,
read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“A general treatment is required for the Jewish problem for
which a temporary solution will have to be determined
(forced labor for the Jews, creation of Ghettos, etc.).”
(<span class='it'>1024-PS</span>)</p>

</div>
<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='989' id='Page_989'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter Rosenberg issued instructions that Jewish forced
labor should be utilized for every manual labor task:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The standing rule for the Jewish labor employment is the
complete and unyielding use of Jewish manpower regardless
of age in the reconstruction of the occupied eastern territories.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Violations against German measures, especially against the
forced labor regulations, are to be punished by death to the
Jews.” (<span class='it'>212-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From the ghettos Jewish labor was selected and sent to a concentration
area. Here the usable Jews were screened from those
considered worthless. For example, a contingent of 45,000 Jews
could be expected to yield 10,000 to 15,000 usable laborers. This
estimate is based on an RSHA telegram to Himmler, marked
“Urgent” and “Secret”, and dated 16 December 1942.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the total of 45,000 are included physically handicapped
and others (old Jews and children). In making a distribution
for this purpose, at least 10,000 to 15,000 laborers will
be available when the Jews arriving at Auschwitz are assigned.”
(<span class='it'>1472-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The report from Lieutenant General of Police, Katzmann, to
General of the Police East, Krueger, clearly outlines the nature
of the Jewish forced labor:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The best remedy consisted of the formation, by the SS and
Police Leader, of forced labor camps. The best opportunity
for labor was offered by the necessity to complete the ‘Dg.4’
road which was extremely important and necessary for the
whole of the southern part of the front, and which was in a
catastrophically bad condition. On October 15th 1941, the
establishment of camps along the road was commenced, and
despite considerable difficulties there existed, after a few
weeks only, seven camps containing 4,000 Jews.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Soon more camps followed these first ones, so that after a
very short time the completion of fifteen camps of this kind
could be reported to the Superior Leader of SS and Police.
In the course of time about 20,000 Jewish laborers passed
through these camps. Despite the hardly imaginable difficulties
occurring at this work I can report today that about
160 kilometers of the road are completed.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At the same time all other Jews fit for work were registered
and distributed for useful work by the labor agencies.
<span class='pageno' title='990' id='Page_990'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>* * * When the Jews were marked by the Star of David,
as well as when they were registered by the labor agencies,
the first symptoms appeared in their attempts to dodge the
order of the authorities. The measures which were introduced
thereupon led to thousands of arrests. It became more
and more apparent that the civil administration was not in a
position to solve the Jewish problem in an approximately
satisfactory manner. Then, for instance, the municipal administration
at Lwow had no success in their attempts to
house the Jews within a closed district which would be inhabited
only by Jews. This question, too, was solved quickly
by the SS and Police Leaders through subordinate officials.
This measure became the more urgent as in the winter, 1941,
big centers of spotted fever were noted in many parts of the
town.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“During this removal of the Jews into a certain quarter of
the town several sluices were erected at which all the work-shy
and asocial Jewish rabble were caught during the screening
and treated in a special way. Owing to the peculiar fact
that almost 90% of artisans working in Galicia were Jews,
the task to be solved could be fulfilled only step by step, since
an immediate evacuation would not have served the interest
of War Economy.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Cases were discovered where Jews, in order to acquire
any certificate of labor, not only renounced all wages, but
even paid money themselves. Moreover, the organizing of Jews
for the benefit of their employers grew to such catastrophical
extent that it was deemed necessary to interfere in the most
energetic manner for the benefit of the German name. Since
the administration was not in a position and showed itself
too weak to master this chaos, the SS and Police Leader
simply took over the entire disposition of labor for Jews. The
Jewish labor agencies, which were manned by hundreds of
Jews, were dissolved. All certificates of labor given by firms
or administrative offices were declared invalid, and the cards
given to the Jews by the labor agencies were revalidated by
the police offices by stamping them. In the course of this
action, again, thousands of Jews were caught who were in
possession of forged certificates or who had obtained, surreptitiously,
certificates of labor by all kinds of pretexts.
These Jews also were exposed to special treatment.” (<span class='it'>L-18</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The means of accomplishing the extermination of the Jews are
discussed in the diary of Hans Frank, then Governor-General of
Occupied Poland (<span class='it'>2233-D-PS</span>). In a cabinet session on Tuesday,
16 December 1941 in the Government Building at Cracow,
Frank made a closing address, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As far as the Jews are concerned, I want to tell you quite
frankly that they must be done away with in one way or another.
The Fuehrer said once: ‘Should united Jewry again
succeed in provoking a world-war, the blood of not only the
nations which have been forced into the war by them, will be
shed, but the Jew will have found his end in Europe’. I know
that many of the measures carried out against the Jews in
the Reich at present are being criticized. It is being tried
intentionally, as is obvious from the reports on the morale,
to talk about cruelty, harshness, etc. Before I continue, I
want to beg you to agree with me on the following formula:
We will principally have pity on the German people only, and
<span class='pageno' title='992' id='Page_992'></span>
nobody else in the whole world. The others, too, had no pity
on us. As an old National-Socialist, I must say: This war
would only be a partial success if the whole lot of Jewry would
survive it, while we would have shed our best blood in order
to save Europe. My attitude towards the Jews will, therefore,
be based only on the expectation that they must disappear.
They must be done away with. I have entered negotiations
to have them deported to the East. A great discussion
concerning that question will take place in Berlin in January,
to which I am going to delegate the State Secretary Dr.
Buehler. That discussion is to take place in the Reich Security
Main Office with SS-Lt. General Heydrich. A great
Jewish migration will begin, in any case.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“But what should be done with the Jews? Do you think they
will be settled down in the ‘Ostland’, in villages? This is
what we were told in Berlin: Why all this bother? We can do
nothing with them either in the ‘Ostland’ nor in the ‘Reichskommissariat’.
So liquidate them yourself.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Gentlemen, I must ask you to rid yourself of all feeling of
pity. We must annihilate the Jews, wherever we find them
and wherever it is possible, in order to maintain there the
structure of the Reich as a whole. This will, naturally, be
achieved by other methods than those pointed out by Bureau
Chief Dr. Hummel. Nor can the judges of the Special Courts
be made responsible for it, because of the limitations of the
framework of the legal procedure. Such outdated views cannot
be applied to such gigantic and unique events. We must
find at any rate a way which leads to the goal, and my
thoughts are working in that direction.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jews represent for us also extraordinarily malignant
gluttons. We have now approximately 2,500,000 of them in
the General Government, perhaps with the Jewish mixtures
and everything that goes with it, 3,500,000 Jews. We cannot
shoot or poison those 3,500,000 Jews, but we shall nevertheless
be able to take measures, which will lead, somehow, to
their annihilation, and this in connection with the gigantic
measures to be determined in discussions from the Reich.
The General Government must become free of Jews, the same
as the Reich. Where and how this is to be achieved is a matter
for the offices which we must appoint and create here.
Their activities will be brought to your attention in due
course.” (<span class='it'>2233-D-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>This was not the planning and scheming of an irresponsible individual,
but the expression by the Governor-General of Occupied
Poland, of the official policy of the German State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg’s notion of the means to be taken against the Jews
is expressed in a secret “Document Memorandum for the Fuehrer—Concerning:
Jewish Possessions in France,” dated 18 December
1941. Rosenberg urges plundering and death:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * In compliance with the order of the Fuehrer for
protection of Jewish cultural possessions, a great number of
Jewish dwellings remained unguarded. Consequently, many
furnishings have disappeared because a guard could, naturally,
not be posted. In the whole East the administration
has found terrible conditions of living quarters, and the
chances of procurement are so limited that it is not practical
to procure any more. Therefore, I beg the Fuehrer to permit
the seizure of all Jewish home furnishings of Jews in Paris,
who have fled or will leave shortly, and that of Jews living in
all parts of the occupied West, to relieve the shortage of furnishings
in the administration in the East.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. A great number of leading Jews were, after a short examination
in Paris, again released. The attempts on the lives
of members of the armed forces have not stopped; on the
contrary they continue. This reveals an unmistakable plan
to disrupt the German-French cooperation, to force Germany
to retaliate, and, with this, evoke a new defense on the part
of the French against Germany. I suggest to the Fuehrer
that, instead of executing 100 Frenchmen, we substitute 100
Jewish bankers, lawyers, etc. It is the Jews in London and
New York who incite the French communists to commit acts
of violence, and it seems only fair that the members of this
race should pay for this. It is not the little Jews, but the
leading Jews in France, who should be held responsible. That
would tend to awaken the Anti-Jewish sentiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Starvation.</span> Chief among the methods utilized for the annihilation
of the Jewish people was starvation. Policies were designed
and adopted to deprive the Jews of the most elemental
necessities of life. Hans Frank, then Governor-General of Poland,
wrote in his diary that hunger rations were introduced in the
Warsaw Ghetto (<span class='it'>2233-E-PS</span>). Referring to the new food regulations
of August 1942, he noted that by these food regulations
more than one million Jews were virtually condemned to
death.
<span class='pageno' title='994' id='Page_994'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“That we sentence 1,200,000 Jews to die of hunger should be
noted only marginally. It is a matter of course that should
the Jews not starve to death it would we hope result in a
speeding up of the anti-Jewish measures.” (<span class='it'>2233-E-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In pursuance of the deliberate policy of Jewish starvation, Jews
were prohibited from pursuing agricultural activities in order to
cut them off from access to sources of food. A document entitled
“Provisional Directives on the Treatment of Jews”, issued by the
Reichscommissar for the Ostland, provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Jews must be cleaned out from the countryside. The Jews
are to be removed from all trades, especially from trade with
agricultural products and other foodstuffs.” (<span class='it'>1138-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jews were also excluded from the purchase of basic food, such
as wheat products, meat, eggs, and milk. A decree dated 18
September 1942, from the Ministry of Agriculture, provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Jews will no longer receive the following foods, beginning
with the 42nd distribution period (19 October 1942): meat,
meat products, eggs, wheat products (cake, white bread,
wheat rolls, wheat flour, etc.) whole milk, fresh skimmed
milk, as well as such food distributed not on food ration cards
issued uniformly throughout the Reich but on local supply
certificates or by special announcement of the nutrition office
on extra coupons of the food cards. Jewish children and
young people over ten years of age will receive the bread
ration of the normal consumer.” (<span class='it'>1347-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The sick, the old, and pregnant mothers were excluded from the
special food concessions allotted to non-Jews. Seizure by the
State Police of food shipments to Jews from abroad was authorized,
and Jewish ration cards were distinctly marked with the
word “Jew” in color across the face of the cards, so that the store-keepers
could readily identify and discriminate against Jewish
purchasers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to page 110 of an official document of the Czechoslovakian
government published in 1943 and entitled “Czechoslovakia
Fights Back,” Jewish food purchases were confined to certain
areas, to certain days, and to certain hours. As might be
expected, the period permitted for the purchases occurred during
the time when food stocks were likely to be exhausted. (<span class='it'>1689-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By Special Order No. 44 for the Eastern Occupied Territories,
dated 4 November 1941, Jews were limited to rations as low as
only one-half of the lowest basic category of other people, and
the Ministry of Agriculture was empowered to exclude Jews entirely
or partially from obtaining food thus exposing the Jewish
community to death by starvation. A bulletin issued by the Polish
<span class='pageno' title='995' id='Page_995'></span>
Ministry of Information, dated 15 December 1942, concludes that
upon the basis of the nature of the separate rationing and the
amount of food available to Jews in the Warsaw and Cracow
ghettos, the system was designed to bring about starvation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In regard to food supplies they are brought under a completely
separate system, which is obviously aimed at depriving
them of the most elemental necessities of life.” (<span class='it'>L-165</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Annihilation.</span> Annihilation within the ghettos is illustrated
and glorified in the report of Major General of the Police Stroop,
entitled “The Warsaw Ghetto is No More.” (<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This report bound in leather profusely illustrated, typed on
heavy bond paper, and almost 75 pages in length, is the almost
unbelievable recital of a proud accomplishment by Stroop, who
signed the report with a bold hand. Stroop in his report first
pays tribute to the bravery and heroism of the German forces who
participated in the ruthless actions against a defenseless group of
Jews numbering, to be exact 56,065—including infants and
women. His report relates day-by-day progress in the accomplishment
of his mission—to destroy and to obliterate the Warsaw
Ghetto. According to this report, the ghetto, which was established
in Warsaw in November 1940, was inhabited by about
400,000 Jews; and prior to the action for the destruction of this
Ghetto, some 316,000 had already been deported.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are some of the boastful and vivid account’s of the scenes
within the Warsaw Ghetto:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The resistance put up by the Jews and bandits could be
broken only by relentlessly using all our forces and energy
by day and night. On 23 April 1943 the Reichsfuehrer SS
issued through the Higher SS and Police Fuehrer East at
Cracow his order to complete the combing out of the Warsaw
Ghetto with the greatest severity and relentless tenacity.
I therefore decided to destroy the entire Jewish residential
area by setting every block on fire, including the blocks of
residential buildings near the armament works. One concern
after the other was systematically evacuated and subsequently
destroyed by fire. The Jews then emerged from
their hiding places and dugouts in almost every case. Not
infrequently, the Jews stayed in the burning buildings until,
because of the heat and the fear of being burned alive, they
preferred to jump down from the upper stories after having
thrown mattresses and other upholstered articles into the
street from the burning buildings. With their bones broken,
they still tried to crawl across the street into blocks of
<span class='pageno' title='996' id='Page_996'></span>
buildings which had not yet been set on fire or were only
partially in flames. Often the Jews changed their hiding
places during the night, by moving into the ruins of burnt-out
buildings, taking refuge there until they were found by
our patrols. Their stay in the sewers also ceased to be
pleasant after the first week. Frequently from the street,
we could hear loud voices coming through the sewer shafts.
Then the men of the Waffen SS, the Police or the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>
Engineers courageously climbed down from the shafts to
bring out the Jews and not infrequently they then stumbled
over Jews already dead, or were shot at. It was always
necessary to use smoke candles to drive out the Jews. Thus
one day we opened 183 sewer entrance holes, and at a fixed
time lowered smoke candles into them, with the result that
the bandits fled from what they believed to be gas in the
center of the former Ghetto, where they could then be
pulled out of the sewer holes there. A great number of
Jews who could not be counted were exterminated by blowing
up sewers and dugouts.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The longer the resistance lasted the tougher the men of
the Waffen SS, Police, and <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> became. They fulfilled
their duty indefatigably in faithful comradeship, and
stood together as models and examples of soldiers. Their
duty hours often lasted from early morning until late at
night. At night search patrols with rags wound round
their feet remained at the heels of the Jews and gave them
no respite. Not infrequently they caught and killed Jews
who used the night hours for supplementing their stores
from abandoned dugouts and for contacting neighboring
groups or exchanging news with them.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Considering that the greater part of the men of the Waffen
SS had only been trained for three to four weeks before
being assigned to this action, high credit should be given
to the pluck, courage and devotion to duty which they
showed. It must be stated that the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> Engineers,
too, executed the blowing up of dugouts, sewers and concrete
buildings with indefatigability and great devotion to duty.
Officers and men of the police, a large part of whom had
already been at the front, again excelled by their dashing
spirit.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Only through the continuous and untiring work of all involved
did we succeed in catching a total of 56,065 Jews
whose extermination can be proved. To this should be
<span class='pageno' title='997' id='Page_997'></span>
added the number of Jews who lost their lives in explosions
or fires, but whose number could not be ascertained.”
(<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of his report Stroop lists the losses of German
troops:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the Fuehrer and their country the following fell in the
battle for the destruction of Jews and bandits in the former
ghetto of Warsaw * * *” [Fifteen names are thereafter
listed].</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Furthermore, the Polish police sergeant Julian Zielinski,
born 13 November 1891, 8th Commissariat, fell on 19 April
1943 while fulfilling his duty. They gave their utmost, their
life. We shall never forget them.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The following were wounded * * *” [There follow
the names of 60 Waffen SS personnel] “11 watchmen from
training camps, probably Lithuanians; 12 Security Police
officers in SS units; 5 men of the Polish Police; and 2
regular army personnel, engineers.” (<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The story continues in the daily teletype reports, from which
the following are excerpts:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Our setting the block on fire achieved the result in the
course of the night that those Jews whom we had not been
able to find despite all our search operations left their hideouts
under the roofs, in the cellars, and elsewhere, and appeared
on the outside of the buildings, trying to escape the
flames. Masses of them—entire families—were already
aflame and jumped from the windows or endeavored to let
themselves down by means of sheets tied together or the
like. Steps had been taken so that these Jews as well as
the remaining ones were liquidated at once.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“When the blocks of buildings mentioned above were destroyed,
120 Jews were caught and numerous Jews were destroyed
when they jumped from the attics to the inner
courtyards, trying to escape the flames. Many more Jews
perished in the flames or were destroyed when the dugouts
and sewer entrances were blown up.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Not until the blocks of buildings were well aflame and were
about to collapse did a further considerable number of Jews
emerge, forced to do so by the flames and the smoke. Time
and again the Jews try to escape even through burning
buildings. Innumerable Jews whom we saw on the roofs
<span class='pageno' title='998' id='Page_998'></span>
during the conflagration perished in the flames. Others
emerged from the upper stories in the last possible moment
and were only able to escape death from the flames by
jumping down. Today we caught a total of 2,283 Jews, of
whom 204 were shot, and innumerable Jews were destroyed
in dugouts and in the flames.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jews testify that they emerge at night to get fresh air,
since it is unbearable to stay permanently within the dugouts
owing to the long duration of the operation. On the
average the raiding parties shoot 30 to 50 Jews each night.
From these statements it was to be inferred that a considerable
number of Jews are still underground in the
Ghetto. Today we blew up a concrete building which we
had not been able to destroy by fire. In this operation we
learned that the blowing up of a building is a very lengthy
process and takes an enormous amount of explosives. The
best and only method for destroying the Jews therefore still
remains the setting of fires.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Some depositions speak of three to four thousand Jews who
still remain in underground holes, sewers, and dugouts; The
undersigned is resolved not to terminate the large-scale
operation until the last Jew has been destroyed.” (<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The teletype message of 15 May 1945 indicates that the operation
is in its last stage:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“A special unit once more searched the last block of buildings
which was still intact in the Ghetto, and subsequently destroyed
it. In the evening the chapel, mortuary, and all
other buildings in the Jewish cemetery were blown up or
destroyed by fire.” (<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On 24 May 1943 the final figures were compiled by Major General
Stroop:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Of the total of 56,065 caught, about 7,000 were destroyed
in the former Ghetto during large-scale operation. 6,929
Jews were destroyed by transporting them to T.II [believed
to be Treblinka Camp No. 2]. The sum total of Jews destroyed
is therefore 13,929. Beyond the number of 56,065 an
estimated number of 5 to 6,000 Jews were destroyed by
being blown up or by perishing in the flames.” (<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was not always necessary, or perhaps desirable, to place the
Jews within Ghettos to effect elimination. In the Baltic States
a more direct course of action was followed. According to a
report by SS Brigade Fuehrer Stahlecker to Himmler, dated 15
<span class='pageno' title='999' id='Page_999'></span>
October 1941, entitled “Action Group A,” which was found in
Himmler’s private files, 135,567 persons, nearly all Jews, were
murdered in accordance to basic orders directing the complete
annihilation of Jews. SS Brigade Fuehrer Stahlecker continues
his report:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * To our surprise it was not easy at first to set in
motion an extensive pogrom against the Jews. Klimatis,
the leader of the partisan unit, mentioned above, who was
used for this purpose primarily, succeeded in starting a
pogrom on the basis of advice given to him by a small advanced
detachment acting in Kowno and in such a way that
no German order or German instigation was noticed from
the outside. During the first pogrom in the night from 25
to 26 June the Lithuanian partisans did away with more
than 1,500 Jews, setting fire to several synagogues or destroying
them by other means and burning down a Jewish
dwelling district consisting of about 60 houses. During the
following nights about 2,300 Jews were made harmless in a
similar way. * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It was possible, though, through similar influences on the
Latvian auxiliary to set in motion a pogrom against the
Jews also in Riga. During this pogrom all synagogues were
destroyed and about 400 Jews were killed.” (<span class='it'>L-180</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Nazi ingenuity reached its zenith with the construction and
operation of the gas van as a means of mass annihilation of the
Jews. A description of the operation of these vehicles of death
is fully set forth in a captured Top Secret document dated 16
May 1942, addressed to SS Obersturmbannfuehrer Rauff, 8
Prince Albrecht-Strasse, Berlin, from Dr. Becker, SS Untersturmfuehrer.
The report reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The overhauling of vans by groups D and C is finished.
While the vans of the first series can also be put into action
if the weather is not too bad, the vans of the second series
(<span class='it'>Saurer</span>) stop completely in rainy weather. If it has rained
for instance for only one half hour, the van cannot be used
because it simply skids away. It can only be used in absolutely
dry weather. It is only a question now whether the
van can only be used standing at the place of execution.
First the van has to be brought to that place, which is possible
only in good weather. The place of execution is usually
10 to 15 km away from the highways and is difficult of
access because of its location; in damp or wet weather it is
not accessible at all. If the persons to be executed are
<span class='pageno' title='1000' id='Page_1000'></span>
driven or led to that place, then they realize immediately
what is going on and get restless, which is to be avoided as
far as possible. There is only one way left; to load them
at the collecting point and to drive them to the spot.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I ordered the vans of group D to be camouflaged as house-trailers
by putting one set of window shutters on each side
of the small van and two on each side of the larger vans,
such as one often sees on farm houses in the country. The
vans became so well-known, that not only the authorities
but also the civilian population called the van ‘death van’,
as soon as one of these vehicles appeared. It is my opinion
the van cannot be kept secret for any length of time, not
even camouflaged.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Because of the rough terrain and the indescribable road
and highway conditions the caulkings and rivets loosen in
the course of time. I was asked if in such cases the vans
should be brought to Berlin for repair. Transportation to
Berlin would be much too expensive and would demand too
much fuel. In order to save those expenses I ordered them
to have smaller leaks soldered and if that should no longer be
possible, to notify Berlin immediately by radio, that Pol. Nr.
is out of order. Besides that I ordered that during application
of gas all the men were to be kept as far away from
the vans as possible, so they should not suffer damage to
their health by the gas which eventually would escape. I
should like to take this opportunity to bring the following
to your attention: several commands have had the unloading
after the application of gas done by their own men. I
brought to the attention of the commanders of those S.K.
concerned the immense psychological injuries and damages
to their health which that work can have for those men, even
if not immediately, at least later on. The men complained
to me about headaches which appeared after each unloading.
Nevertheless they don’t want to change the orders, because
they are afraid prisoners called for that work, could use an
opportune moment to flee. To protect the men from those
damages, I request orders be issued accordingly.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The application of gas usually is not undertaken correctly.
In order to come to an end as fast as possible, the driver
presses the accelerator to the fullest extent. By doing that
the persons to be executed suffer death from suffocation
and not death by dozing off as was planned. My directions
now have proved that by correct adjustment of the levers
<span class='pageno' title='1001' id='Page_1001'></span>
death comes faster and the prisoners fall asleep peacefully.
Distorted faces and excretions, such as could be seen before,
are no longer noticed.</p>

be reached with further news.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A letter signed by Hauptsturmfuehrer Truehe on the subject
of S-vans, addressed to the Reich Security Main Office, Room
2-D-3-A, Berlin, and marked “Top Secret,” establishes that the
vans were used for the annihilation of the Jews. The message
reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“A transport of Jews, which has to be treated in a special
way, arrives weekly at the office of the commandant of the
Security Police and the Security Service of White Ruthenia.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The three S-vans which are there are not sufficient for that
purpose. I request assignment of another S-van (five tons).
At the same time I request the shipment of twenty gas hoses
for the three S-vans on hand (two Diamond, one Saurer),
since the ones on hand are leaky already.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It appears that a certain amount of discord existed between
officials of the German government as to the proper means and
methods to be used in connection with the extermination program.
A secret report dated 18 June 1943, addressed to Rosenberg, complained
that five thousand Jews killed by the police and SS might
have been used for forced labor, and chided them for failing to
bury the bodies of those liquidated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The fact that Jews receive special treatment requires no
further discussion. However, it appears hardly believable
that this is done in the way described in the report of the
General Commissioner of 1 June 1943. What is Katyn
against that? Imagine only that these occurrences would become
known to the other side and exploited by them! Most
likely such propaganda would have no effect only because people
who hear and read about it simply would not be ready to
believe it.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“To lock men, women, and children into barns and to set fire
to them does not appear to be a suitable method of combatting
bands, even if it is desired to exterminate the population.
This method is not worthy of the German cause and hurts
our reputation severely.” (<span class='it'>R-135</span>)</p>

<span class='pageno' title='1002' id='Page_1002'></span>
1943, addressed to the General Commissioner for White Ruthenia,
was critical by implication. This letter, entitled, “Action

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 13 April 1943 the former German dentist Ernst Israel
Tichauer and his wife, Elisa Sara Tichauer, nee Rosenthal,
were committed to the court prison by the Security Service.
Since that time all German and Russian Jews who were
turned over to us had their golden bridgework, crowns, and
fillings pulled or broken out. This happens always one to two
hours before the respective action.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Since 13 April 1943, 516 German and Russian Jews have

<p class='pindent'>The foregoing letter was forwarded to Rosenberg, as Reich

<p class='noindent'>“For the personal information of the Chief of the Industrial
Armament Department I am forwarding a total account of
the present situation in the Reichskommissariat Ukraine in
which the difficulties and tensions encountered so far and the
problems which give rise to serious anxiety are stated with
unmistakable clarity.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Intentionally I have desisted from submitting such a report
through official channels or to make it known to other departments
interested in it because I do not expect any results
that way, but to the contrary am apprehensive that the difficulties
and tensions and also the divergent opinions might
only be increased due to the peculiarity of the situation.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='1003' id='Page_1003'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Jewish problem:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Regulation of the Jewish question in the Ukraine was a difficult
problem because the Jews constituted a large part of the
urban population. We therefore have to deal—just as in the
General Government—with a mass problem of policy concerning
the population. Many cities had a percentage of
Jews exceeding fifty percent. Only the rich Jews had fled
from the German troops. The majority of Jews remained
under German administration. The latter found the problem
more complicated through the fact that these Jews represented
almost the entire trade and even a part of the manpower
in small and medium industries besides the business
which had in part become superfluous as a direct or indirect
result of the war. The elimination therefore necessarily had
far-reaching economic consequences and even direct consequences
for the armament industry (production for supplying
the troops).”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The attitude of the Jewish population was anxious—obliging
from the beginning. They tried to avoid everything
that might displease the German administration. That they
hated the German administration and army inwardly goes
without saying and cannot be surprising. However, there is
no proof that Jewry as a whole or even to a greater part was
implicated in acts of sabotage. Surely there were some terrorists
or saboteurs among them just as among the Ukrainians.
But it cannot be said that the Jews as such represented
a danger to the German armed forces. The output produced
by Jews who, of course, were prompted by nothing but the
feeling of fear, was satisfactory to the troops and the German
administration.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jewish population remained temporarily unmolested
shortly after the fighting. Only weeks, sometimes months
later, specially detached formations of the police executed a
planned shooting of Jews. The action as a rule proceeded
from east to west. It was done entirely in public with the
use of the Ukrainian militia, and unfortunately in many instances
also with members of the armed forces taking part
voluntarily. The way these actions, which included men and
old men, women, and children of all ages were carried out was
horrible. The great masses executed make this action more
gigantic than any similar measure taken so far in the Soviet
Union. So far about 150,000 to 200,000 Jews may have been
<span class='pageno' title='1004' id='Page_1004'></span>
executed in the part of the Ukraine belonging to the Reichskommissariat;
no consideration was given to the interests of
economy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Summarizing, it can be said that the kind of solution of the
Jewish problem applied in the Ukraine which obviously was
based on the ideological theories as a matter of principle had
the following results:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>a</span>) Elimination of a part of partly superfluous eaters in the
cities.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>b</span>) Elimination of a part of the population which hated us
undoubtedly.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>c</span>) Elimination of badly needed tradesmen who were in
many instances indispensable even in the interests of the
armed forces.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>d</span>) Consequences as to foreign policy—propaganda which
are obvious.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>e</span>) Bad effects on the troops which in any case get indirect
contact with the executions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“(<span class='it'>f</span>) Brutalizing effect on the formations which carry out the
execution—regular police.” (<span class='it'>3257-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Lest it be thought that these conditions existed only in the
East, the official Netherlands government report by the Commissioner
for Repatriation as relates similar treatment of the Jews
in the West (<span class='it'>1726-PS</span>). The German measures taken against
the Dutch Jews—discriminatory decrees, anti-semitic demonstrations,
burning of synagogues, purging of Jews from the economic
life of their country, food restrictions, forced labor, concentration
camp confinement, deportation, and death—all these measures
follow the same pattern that was effected throughout Nazi-occupied
Europe. The official Netherlands report states that full Jews,
liable to deportation, numbered 140,000. The total number of actual
Jewish deportees was 117,000, representing more than eighty-three
per cent of all the Jews in the Netherlands. Of these, 115,000
were deported to Poland for slave labor, and after departure all
trace of them was lost. Regardless of victory or defeat to Germany,
the Jew was doomed. It was the expressed intent of the
Nazi state that whatever the German fate might be the Jew would
not survive. (<span class='it'>1726-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Top Secret message from the commandant of the SIPO and
SD for the Radom District, addressed to SS Hauptsturmfuehrer
Thiel on the subject, “Clearance of Prisons,” reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I again stress the fact that the number of inmates of the
SIPO and SD prisons must be kept as low as possible. In the
<span class='pageno' title='1005' id='Page_1005'></span>
present situation, particularly, those suspects handed over by
the civil police need only be subjected to a short, formal interrogation,
provided there are no serious grounds for suspicion.
They are then to be sent by the quickest route to a
concentration camp, should no court-martial proceeding be
necessary or should there be no question of discharge. Please
keep the number of discharges very low. Should the situation
at the front necessitate it, early preparations are to be made
for the total clearance of prisons. Should the situation develop
suddenly in such a way that it is impossible to evacuate
the prisoners, the prison inmates are to be liquidated and
their bodies disposed of as far as possible (burning, blowing
up the building, etc.). If necessary, Jews still employed in
the armament industry or on other work are to be dealt with
in the same way.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The liberation of prisoners or Jews by the enemy, be it the
WB [perhaps means ‘West-Bund,’ or ‘Western Ally’] or the
Red Army, must be avoided under all circumstances, nor may
they fall into their hands alive.” (<span class='it'>L-53</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Mass Disposal of Jews in Concentration Camps.</span> The concentration
camps were utilized to dispose of literally millions of
Jews, who died by mass shooting, gas, poison, starvation, and
other means. The part which the concentration camps played in
the annihilation of the Jewish people is indicated in an official
Polish report on Auschwitz Concentration Camp (<span class='it'>L-161</span>). In
Auschwitz during July 1944 Jews were killed at the rate of 12,000
daily:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * During July 1944, they were being liquidated at
the rate of 12,000 Hungarian Jews daily, and as the crematory
could not deal with such numbers, many bodies were
thrown into large pits and covered with quick lime.” (<span class='it'>L-161</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The official Polish Government Commission Report on the Investigation
of German crimes in Poland describes the concentration
camp at Treblinka in these terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * In March 1942, the Germans began to erect another
camp, Treblinka B, in the neighborhood of Treblinka A,
intended to become a place of torment for Jews.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The erection of this camp was closely connected with the
German plans aiming at a complete destruction of the Jewish
population in Poland which necessitated the creation of a machinery
by means of which the Polish Jews could be killed in
large numbers. Late in April 1942, the erection of the first
three chambers was finished in which these general massacres
<span class='pageno' title='1006' id='Page_1006'></span>
were to be performed by means of steam. Somewhat later
the erection of the real death building was finished, which
contains ten death chambers. It was opened for wholesale
murders early in autumn 1942 * * *.” (<span class='it'>3311-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The report of the Polish commission describes graphically the
procedure for extermination within the camp:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The average number of Jews dealt with at the
camp in summer 1942 was about two railway transports
daily, but there were days of much higher efficiency. From
autumn 1942 this number was falling.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“After unloading in the siding all victims were assembled in
one place where men were separated from women and children.
In the first days of the existence of the camp the victims
were made to believe that after a short stay in the
camp, necessary for bathing and disinfection, they would be
sent farther east, for work. Explanations of this sort were
given by SS men who assisted at the unloading of the transports
and further explanations could be read in notices stuck
up on the walls of the barracks. But later, when more transports
had to be dealt with, the Germans dropped all pretenses
and only tried to accelerate the procedure.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All victims had to strip off their clothes and shoes, which
were collected afterwards, whereupon all victims, women
and children first, were driven into the death chambers.
Those too slow or too weak to move quickly were driven on
by rifle-butts, by whipping and kicking, often by Sauer himself.
Many slipped and fell, the next victims pressed forward
and stumbled over them. Small children were simply
thrown inside. After being filled up to capacity the chambers
were hermetically closed and steam was let in. In a
few minutes all was over. The Jewish menial workers had
to remove the bodies from the platform and to bury them
in mass graves. By and by, as new transports arrived, the
cemetery grew, extending in eastern direction.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“From reports received, it may be assumed that several
hundred thousands of Jews have been exterminated in
Treblinka.” (<span class='it'>3311-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An official United States government report issued by the
Executive Office of the President of the United States, War
Refugee Board, on the German camps at Auschwitz and Birkenau,
sets forth the number of Jews gassed in Birkenau in the two-year
period between April 1942 and April 1944. The figure
printed in this report is not a typographical error. The number
is 1,765,000. (<span class='it'>L-22</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='1007' id='Page_1007'></span></p>

<h3>5. RESULTS OF THE EXTERMINATION PROGRAM</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The huge scale of the Jewish eliminations is also reflected in
the bookkeeping and statistics of the Germans themselves. The
16 December 1941 entry in the diary of Hans Frank contains
these figures:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jews for us also represent extraordinarily malignant
gluttons.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“We have now approximately 2,500,000 of them in General
Government—perhaps with the Jewish mixtures, and everything
that goes with it, 3,500,000 Jews.” (<span class='it'>2233-D-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On 25 January 1944, three years and one month later, Frank
wrote in his diary these words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“At the present time we still have in the General Government
perhaps 100,000 Jews.” (<span class='it'>2233-F-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus, in this period of three years, according to the records of
the then Governor-General of Occupied Poland, between 2,400,000
and 3,400,000 Jews had been eliminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The total number of Jews who died by Nazi hands can never
be definitely ascertained. It is known, however, that 4 million
Jews died in concentration camps, and that 2 million Jews were
killed by the State Police in the East, making a total of 6 million
murdered Jews. The source of these figures is Adolph Eichmann,
Chief of the Jewish Section of the Gestapo. The figures are contained
in an affidavit made by Dr. Wilhelm Hoettl, Deputy Group
Leader of the Foreign Section of the Security Section, AMT VI,
of the RSHA. Hoettl, in his affidavit, states as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Approximately 4 million Jews had been killed in the various
concentration camps, while an additional 2 million met death
in other ways, the major part of which were shot by operational
squads of the Security Police during the campaign
against Russia.” (<span class='it'>2738-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Hoettl describes the source of his information as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to my knowledge, Eichmann was at that time
the leader of the Jewish Section of the Gestapo, and in addition
to that he had been ordered by Himmler to get a hold of
the Jews in all the European countries and to transport them
to Germany. Eichmann was then very much impressed with
the fact that Rumania had withdrawn from the war in those
days. Moreover, he had come to me to get information about
the military situation which I received daily from the Hungarian
Ministry of War and from the Commander of the
Waffen-SS in Hungary. He expressed his conviction that
Germany had now lost the war and that he personally had no
<span class='pageno' title='1008' id='Page_1008'></span>
further chance. He knew that he would be considered one
of the main war criminals by the United Nations, since he
had millions of Jewish lives on his conscience. I asked him
how many that was, to which he answered that although the
number was a great Reich secret, he would tell me since I,
as a historian, would be interested, and that he would probably
not return anyhow from his command in Rumania. He
had, shortly before that, made a report to Himmler, as the
latter wanted to know the exact number of Jews who had
been killed.” (<span class='it'>2738-PS</span>)</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='1023' id='Page_1023'></span><h1>Chapter XIII<br/> GERMANIZATION AND SPOLIATION</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators had made plans for the Germanization
and spoliation of their conquered territories. Plans to Germanize
meant plans to assimilate conquered territories politically, culturally,
socially, and economically into the German Reich. Germanization
meant the obliteration of the former national character
of the conquered territories and the extermination of all
elements which could not be reconciled with the Nazi ideology.
Plans for spoliation meant plans to plunder public and private
property and, in general, to exploit the people and natural resources
of occupied countries.</p>

<h3>1. POLAND</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Poland was, in a sense, the testing ground for the conspirators’
theories of “lebensraum.” The four western provinces of Poland
were purportedly incorporated into Germany by an order of 8
October 1939. This order, which was signed by Hitler, Lammers,
Goering, Frick, and Hess, is set forth in 1939 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, p. 2042. These areas of Poland are frequently referred
to in correspondence between the conspirators as the “incorporated
Eastern territories”. The remainder of Poland which
was seized by the Nazi invaders was established as the Government-General
of Poland by an order of Hitler, dated 12 October
1939. By that same order, Hans Frank was named Governor-General
of the newly-created Government-General, and Seyss-Inquart
was named Deputy Governor-General. This order is set
forth in 1939 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, p. 2077.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plans with respect to Poland, which will appear gradually
from the individual documents hereafter discussed, followed a
broad pattern, as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>First</span>: The conspirators specifically planned to exploit the
people and material resources of the Government-General of
Poland in order to strengthen the Nazi war machine, to impoverish
the Government-General, and to reduce it to a vassal
state. At a later stage, plans were formulated for creating
islands of German settlements in the more fertile regions of the
Government-General in order to engulf the native Polish population
and accelerate the process of Germanization.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Second</span>: The incorporated area of Poland, which was deemed to
be a part of the German Reich, was to be ruthlessly Germanized.
<span class='pageno' title='1024' id='Page_1024'></span>
To that end, the conspirators planned:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) To permit the retention of the productive facilities in the
incorporated area, all of which were to be dedicated to the Nazi
war machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) They planned to deport to the Government-General many
hundreds of thousands of Jews, members of the Polish intelligentsia,
and other noncompliant elements. The Jews deported to
the Government-General were doomed to speedy annihilation.
Moreover, since the conspirators felt that members of the Polish
intelligentsia could not be Germanized and might serve as a center
of resistance against their “new order”, they too were to be
eliminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) They planned to deport all able-bodied Polish workers to
Germany for work in the Nazi war machine. This was to serve
the twofold purpose of helping to satisfy the labor requirements
of the Nazi war machine and preventing the propagation of a
new generation of Poles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) They planned to mold all persons in the incorporated area
who were deemed to possess German blood, into German subjects
who would religiously adhere to the principles of National Socialism.
To that end, the conspirators set up an elaborate racial
register. Those who resisted or refused to cooperate in this program
were sent to concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) They planned to bring thousands of German subjects into
the incorporated area for purposes of settlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>f</span>) They planned to confiscate the property—particularly the
farms—of the Poles, the Jews, and all dissident elements. The
confiscation of the property of Jews was part of the conspirators’
larger program of extermination of the Jews. Confiscation likewise
served three additional purposes: (1) it provided land for
the new German settlers and enabled the conspirators to reward
their adherents; (2) dispossessed Polish property owners could
be shipped to Germany for work in the production of implements
of war; and (3) the separation of Polish farmers from their
wives furthered the plan to prevent the growth of a new generation
of Poles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These plans are developed in the specific documents which
follow.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>The Program in the Incorporated Area.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Economic Spoliation.</span> A report of an interview with Frank
on 3 October 1939, which was included in a large report prepared
in the OKW by one Captain Varain at the direction of General
<span class='pageno' title='1025' id='Page_1025'></span>
Thomas, then Chief of the Military Economic Staff of the OKW,
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the first interview which the chief of the Central Division
and the liaison officer between the Armament Department
Upper East and the Chief Administrative Officer (subsequently
called Governor-General) had with Minister Frank
on October 3, 1939 in Posen, Frank explained the directive,
and the economic and political responsibilities which had been
conferred upon him by the Fuehrer and according to which
he intended to administer Poland. According to these directives,
Poland can only be administered by utilizing the
country through means of ruthless exploitation, deportation
of all supplies, raw materials, machines, factory installations,
etc., which are important for the German war economy,
availability of all workers for work within Germany,
reduction of the entire Polish economy to absolute minimum
necessary for bare existence of the population, closing of all
educational institutions, especially technical schools and colleges
in order to prevent the growth of the new Polish intelligentsia.
‘Poland shall be treated as a colony; the Poles
shall be the slaves of the Greater German World Empire’.
* * *</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“By destroying Polish industry, its subsequent reconstruction
after the war would become more difficult, if not impossible,
so that Poland would be reduced to its proper position
as an agrarian country which would have to depend
upon Germany for importation of industrial products.”
(<span class='it'>EC-344-16 &amp; 17</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The conspirators planned a difference in treatment for the incorporated
area of Poland, and for the Government-General. A
directive issued and signed by Goering on 19 October 1939, which
was found among captured files of the OKW, stated, <span class='it'>inter alia</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the meeting of October 13th, I have given detailed instructions
for the economical administration of the occupied
territories. I will repeat them here in short: 1. The task
for the economic treatment of the various administrative
regions is different depending on whether a country is involved
which will be incorporated politically into the German
Reich or whether we deal with the Government-General,
which, in all probability, will not be made a part of Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In the first mentioned territories the reconstruction and
expansion of the economy, the safeguarding of all their production
facilities and supplies must be aimed at, as well as
<span class='pageno' title='1026' id='Page_1026'></span>
a complete incorporation into the Greater German economic
system at the earliest possible time. On the other hand,
there must be removed from the territories of the Government-General
all raw materials, scrap materials, machines
etc., which are of use for the German war economy. Enterprises
which are not absolutely necessary for the meager
maintenance of the naked existence of the population must
be transferred to Germany, unless such transfer would require
an unreasonably long period of time and would make it
more practical to exploit these enterprises by giving them
German orders to be executed at their present location.”
(<span class='it'>EC-410</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Once the Government-General had been stripped of its industrial
potential, the conspirators planned to leave the country desolate.
Not even the war damage was to be repaired. This is the
clear import of an order dated 20 November 1939, issued by Hess
in his capacity as Deputy Fuehrer, and found in captured OKW
files. Hess stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I hear from Party members who came from the Government-General
that various agencies, as, for instance, the
Military Economic Staff, the Reich Ministry for Labor, etc.,
intend to reconstruct certain industrial enterprises in Warsaw.
However, in accordance with a decision by Minister
Dr. Frank, as approved by the Fuehrer, Warsaw shall not be
rebuilt nor is it the intention of the Fuehrer to rebuild or reconstruct
any industry in the Government-General.”
(<span class='it'>EC-411</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Deportation and Resettlement.</span> The Academy of German
Law in January 1940 prepared a secret report on plans for the
mass migration of Poles and Jews from incorporated areas of
Poland to the Government-General, and for the forcible deportation
of able-bodied Poles to Germany. (The date of the report
does not appear in the English translation, but it is clearly set
forth on the cover page of the original document, as January
1940.) It should be recalled that the decree of 11 July 1934
(<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, p. 605, 11 July 1934) provided that the
Academy of German Law would be a public corporation of the
Reich under the supervision of the Reich Ministers of Justice and
the Interior, and that its task would be:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“To promote the reconstruction of German legal life, and to
realize, in constant close collaboration with the competent
legislative organizations, the National Socialist program in
the entire sphere of the law.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='1027' id='Page_1027'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>It should also be stated that Frank was the president of the Academy
of German Law during the period when this secret report was
made (<span class='it'>2749-PS</span>). The report stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the carrying out of costly and long term measures for
the increase of agricultural production, the Government-General
can at the most absorb 1 to 1.5 million resettlers, as it is
already over-populated. * * * By further absorption of
1.6 million resettlers, the 1925 Reich census figure of 133 inhabitants
per square kilometer would be reached, which practically
because of already existing rural over-population and
lack of industry would result in a double over-population.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This figure of 1.6 million will barely suffice to transfer from
the Reich:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jews from the liberated East (over 600,000), parts of
the remaining Jews, preferably the younger age groups from
Germany proper, Austria, Sudetengau and the Protectorate
(altogether over 1 million). * * *” (<span class='it'>661-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The report then goes on to say that the following groups of
people should be deported:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Polish intelligentsia who have been politically active in
the past, and potential political leaders; the leading economic
personalities, comprising owners of large estates, industrialists
and businessmen, etc.; the peasant population, so far as
it has to be removed in order to carry out by strips of German
settlements the encirclement of Polish territories in the
East * * *.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In order to relieve the living space of the Poles in the Government-General
as well as in the liberated East, one should
remove cheap labor temporarily by the hundreds of thousands,
employ them for a few years in the old Reich, and
thereby hamper their native biological propagation. (Their
assimilation into the old Reich must be prevented.) * * *”
(<span class='it'>661-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, the report stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Strictest care is to be taken that secret circulars, memoranda
and official correspondence which contain instructions
detrimental to the Poles are kept steadily under lock and key
so that they will not some day fill the White Books printed in
Paris or the U.S.A.” (<span class='it'>661-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Frank made the following entry in his diary:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsfuehrer SS (Himmler) wishes that all Jews be
evacuated from the newly gained Reich territories. Up to
<span class='pageno' title='1028' id='Page_1028'></span>
February approximately 1,000,000 people are to be brought
in this way into the Government-General. The families of
good racial extraction present in the occupied Polish territory
(approximately 4,000,000 people) should be transferred into
the Reich and individually housed and thereby be uprooted as
a people.” (<span class='it'>2233-G-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The top secret minutes of a meeting held on 12 February 1940
on “questions concerning the East,” at which Goering was chairman
and Himmler and Frank were present, stated, among other
things:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“By way of introduction, the General Field Marshal (<span class='it'>Goering</span>)
explained that the strengthening of the war potential of the

these from Gotenhafen. From there, also the numerous shirkers,

of 20,000 further persons can be counted on for the current
year. * * *” (<span class='it'>EC-305</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Comparable reports were made by other Gauleiters at this meeting.
These figures, it may be noted, were only as of February
1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These forcible deportations did not involve merely ordering the
victims to leave their homes, and to take up new residences elsewhere.
These deportations were accomplished, according to plan,
<span class='pageno' title='1029' id='Page_1029'></span>
in a brutal and inhuman manner. This is shown in a speech delivered
by Himmler to officers of the SS on a day commemorating
the presentation of the Nazi flag. The exact date of the speech
does not appear in the document, but its contents plainly show
that it was delivered sometime after Poland had been overrun.
In this speech Himmler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Very frequently the member of the Waffen-SS thinks about
the deportation of this people here. These thoughts came to
me today when watching the very difficult work out there
performed by the Security Police, supported by your men,
who help them a great deal. Exactly the same thing happened
in Poland in weather 40 degrees below zero, where we
had to haul away thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands;
where we had to have the toughness * * * you
should hear this but also forget it again—to shoot thousands
of leading Poles.” (<span class='it'>1918-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Such Poles from the incorporated area as managed to survive
the journey to the Government-General could look forward at best
to extreme hardship, and exposure to degradation and brutality.
For the Jews who were forcibly deported to the Government-General
there was no hope. Frank, by his own admissions, had
dedicated himself to their complete annihilation. In his diary
Frank wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We must annihilate the Jews, wherever we find them, and
wherever it is possible.” (<span class='it'>2233-D-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Forcible Return of Racial Germans to the Reich.</span> The conspirators
had planned the forcible Germanization of persons in
the incorporated area who were deemed to possess German blood.
Such persons were given the choice of the concentration camp, or
submission to Germanization. Himmler was the chief executioner
of this program. In a secret decree signed by Hitler, Goering, and
Keitel, dated 7 October 1939, Himmler was entrusted with the task
of executing the conspirators’ Germanization program. The decree
provided, among other things:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsfuehrer SS (Himmler) has the obligation in accordance
with my directives:</p>

<div class='listEntry'>

nationals, and racial Germans in the foreign countries.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“2.</span><p class='listPara'>To eliminate the harmful influence of such alien-parts of

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsfuehrer SS is authorized to take all necessary
general and administrative measures for the execution
of this obligation.” (<span class='it'>686-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Himmler’s conception of his tasks under this decree were
plainly stated in the foreword which he wrote for the “<span class='it'>Deutsche
Arbeit</span>” issue of June/July 1942. He wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is not our task to Germanize the East in the old sense,
that is, to teach the people there the German language and
German law, but to see to it that only people of purely German,
Germanic blood live in the East.” (<span class='it'>2915-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The 1940 Edition of “<span class='it'>Der Menscheneinsatz</span>,” a confidential
publication issued by Himmler’s Office for the Consolidation of
German Nationhood, contained the following statements:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The removal of foreign races from the incorporated Eastern
Territories is one of the most essential goals to be accomplished
in the German East. This is the chief national political
task, which has to be executed in the incorporated
Eastern Territories by the Reichsfuehrer SS, Reich Commissioner
for the strengthening of the national character of the
German people.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * there are the following two primary reasons,
which make the regaining of lost German blood an urgent necessity.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Further light upon the goals which the conspirators had set
for their Germanization program in conquered Eastern areas,
is contained in a speech delivered by Himmler on 14 October 1943.
This speech was published by the National Socialist Leadership
staff of the OKW. The following are excerpts from this speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I consider that in dealing with members of a foreign country,
especially some Slav nationality, we must not start from
German points of view, and we must not endow these people
with decent German thoughts, and logical conclusions of
which they are not capable, but we must take them as they
really are * * *.”
<span class='pageno' title='1031' id='Page_1031'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>“Obviously in such a mixture of peoples, there will always
be some racially good types. Therefore, I think that it is
our duty to take their children with us, to remove them
from their environment, if necessary by robbing, or stealing
them. Either we win over any good blood that we can use
for ourselves and give it a place in our people, or * * *
we destroy that blood.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For us the end of this war will mean an open road to the
East, the creation of the Germanic Reich in this way or that
* * * the fetching home of 30 million human beings of
our blood, so that still during our lifetime we shall be a
people of 120 million Germanic souls. That means that we
shall be the sole decisive power in Europe. That means
that we shall then be able to tackle the peace, during which
we shall be willing for the first twenty years to rebuild and
spread out our villages and towns, and that we shall push
the borders of our German race 500 kilometers further out
to the East.” (<span class='it'>L-70</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>The Racial Register.</span> In furtherance of these plans, the
conspirators established a Racial Register in the incorporated
area of Poland. The Racial Register was, in effect, an elaborate
classification of persons deemed to be of German blood, and contained
provisions setting forth some of the rights, privileges, and
duties of the persons in each classification. Persons were classified
into four groups:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Germans who had actively promoted the Nazi cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) Germans who had been more or less passive in the Nazi
struggle, but had retained their German nationality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) Persons of German extraction who, although previously
connected with the Polish nation, were willing to submit to Germanization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) Persons of German descent, who had been “politically absorbed
by the Polish nation”, and who would be resistant to Germanization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Racial Register was inaugurated under a decree of 12 September
1940, issued by Himmler as Reich Commissioner for the
Consolidation of German Nationhood. The following are pertinent
extracts:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The list of ‘ethnic Germans’ will be divided into four parts
(limited to interoffice use).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Ethnic Germans who fought actively in the ethnic
<span class='pageno' title='1032' id='Page_1032'></span>
struggle. Besides the membership of a German organization,
every other activity in favor of the German against a
foreign nationality will be considered an active manifestation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Ethnic Germans, who did not actively intervene in favor
of the German nationality, but who preserved their traceable
German nationality.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Persons of German descent, who became connected with
the Polish nation in the course of the years, but have on
account of their attitude, the prerequisites to become full-fledged
members of the German national community. To
this group belong also persons of non-German descent who
live in a people’s mixed marriage with an ethnic German in
which the influence of the German spouse has prevailed.
Persons of Masurian, Slonzak, or upper Silesian descent who
are to be recognized as ethnic Germans, usually belong to
this group 3.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. Persons of German descent, politically absorbed by
the Polish nation (renegades).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Persons not included on the list of ethnic Germans are
Poles, or foreign nationals. Their treatment is regulated by
BII.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Members of groups 1 and 2 are ethnic Germans who will
be used for the reconstruction in the East. The differentiation
between the groups 1 and 2 is important for the National
Socialist Party; primarily only members of group 1
should be accepted in the Party according to the instructions
of the deputy of the Fuehrer.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Members of groups 3 and 4 have to be educated as full
Germans, that is, have to be re-Germanized in the course of
time through an intensive educational training in old Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The establishment of members of group 4 has to be based
on the doctrine, that German blood must not be utilized in
the interest of a foreign nation. Against those who refuse
re-Germanization, Security Police measures are to be taken.”
(<span class='it'>2916-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The basic idea of creating a racial register for persons of German
extraction was later incorporated into a decree of 3 March
1941, signed by Himmler, Frick, and Hess. This decree is set
forth in the 1941 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> Part 1, page 118.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire apparatus of the SS was thrown behind the vigorous
execution of these decrees. Proof of this fact is contained in the
<span class='pageno' title='1033' id='Page_1033'></span>
following extracts from directives issued by Himmler as the
Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I. Where Racial Germans have not applied for entry in the
‘German Ethnical List,’ you will instruct the subordinate
agencies to turn over their names to the State Police (Superior)
Office. Subsequently, you will report to me
(Himmler).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“II. The Local State Police (Superior) Office, will charge
the persons whose names are turned over to them to prove
within eight days that they have applied for entry in the
‘German Ethnical List.’</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If such proof is not submitted, the person in question is
to be taken into protective custody for transfer into a concentration
camp.” (<span class='it'>R-112</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The measures taken against persons in the fourth category,
“Polonized Germans,” were particularly harsh. These persons
were resistant to Germanization, and ruthless measures calculated
to break their resistance were prescribed. Where the individual’s
past history indicated that he could not be effectively
Germanized, he was thrown into a concentration camp. In the
words of Himmler’s decree of 16 February 1942:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“II. The Re-Germanization of the Polonized Germans presupposes
their complete separation from Polish surroundings.
For that reason the persons entered in Division 4 of
the German Ethnical List are to be dealt with in the following
manner:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A. They are to be re-settled in Old Reich territory.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. The Superior SS and Police Leaders are charged with
evacuating and resettling them according to instructions
which will follow later.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Asocial persons and others who are of inferior hereditary
quality will not be included in the resettlement. Their
names will be turned over at once by the Higher SS and
Police Fuehrer (Inspectors of Security Police and Security
Service) to the competent State Police (Superior) Office.
The latter will arrange for their transfer into a concentration
camp.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. Persons with a particularly bad political record will not
be included in the resettlement action. Their names will
also be given by the Higher SS and Police Fuehrer (Inspectors
of Security Police and Security Service) to the competent
State Police (Superior) Office for transfer into a concentration
camp. The wives and children of such persons
<span class='pageno' title='1034' id='Page_1034'></span>
are to be resettled in old Reich territory and to be included
in the Germanization measures. Where the wife also has a
particularly bad political record, and cannot be included in
the resettlement action, her name, too, is to be turned over
to the competent State Police (Superior) Office with a view
to imprisoning her in a concentration camp. In such cases
the children are to be separated from their parents and to
be dealt with according to III, paragraph 2 of this decree.
Persons are to be considered as having a particularly bad
political record who have offended the German nation to a
very great degree (e.g., who participated in persecutions
of Germans, or boycotts of Germans, etc.).” (<span class='it'>R-112</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Nazi Colonization.</span> Coincident with the program of Germanizing
persons of German extraction in the incorporated areas,
the conspirators, as previously indicated, undertook to settle large
numbers of Germans of proven Nazi convictions in that area.
This aspect of their program is clearly shown by an article by
SS Obergruppenfuehrer and General of the Police, Wilhelm
Koppe, who was one of Himmler’s trusted agents. The following
is an excerpt from this article:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The victory of the German weapons in the East must
therefore be followed by the victory of the German race
over the Polish race, if the regained Eastern sphere—according
to the Fuehrer’s will—henceforth shall for all time
remain an essential constituent part of the Greater German
Reich. It is therefore of decisive importance to penetrate
the regained German region with German farmers, laborers,
civil servants, merchants, and artisans so that a living and
deep-rooted bastion of German people can be formed as a
protective wall against foreign infiltration, and possibly as
a starting point for the racial penetration of the territories
further East.” (<span class='it'>2915-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>The Program in the Government-General</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Germanization.</span> In the Government-General there were
relatively few persons, at the outset, who qualified as Germans by
the conspirators’ standards. Hence, little would be served by the
introduction of a Racial Register, categorizing persons of German
extraction on the model of the one instituted in the incorporated
area; and it is not known that any such Racial Register was prescribed
in the Government-General. Rather, the plan seems to
have been (<span class='it'>a</span>) to make the Government-General a colony of Germany,
which was an objective announced by Frank (<span class='it'>EC-344-16 &amp; 17</span>),
<span class='pageno' title='1035' id='Page_1035'></span>
and (<span class='it'>b</span>) to create so-called “German island settlements” in
the productive farming areas. These island settlements were to
be created by an influx of German persons who faithfully adhered
to the principles of National Socialism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection, secret notes bearing the date line, “Department
of the Interior, Krakow, 30th March, 1942,” reveal some of
Himmler’s ideas on the “planned Germanization” of the Government-General.
The following extracts are pertinent:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsfuehrer SS (Himmler) developed further trains
of ideas to the effect that in the first five-year plan for re-settlement
after the war the new German Eastern territories
should first be filled; afterwards it is intended to provide at
this time the Crimea and the Baltic countries with a German
upper-class at least. Into the Government-General perhaps
further German Island Settlements should be newly transplanted
from European nations. An exact decision in this respect,
however, has not been issued. In any case, it is wished
that at first a heavy colonization along the San and the Brig
be achieved so that the parts of Poland are encircled with
alien populations. Hitherto, it has been always proved that
this kind of encirclement leads most quickly to the desired
nationalization.” (<span class='it'>910-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An entry in Frank’s Diary (1941, volume II, page 317) bears
on the same point:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Thanks to the heroic courage of our soldiers, this territory
has become German, and the time will come when the valley
of the Vistula, from its source to its mouth at the sea, will be
as German as the Valley of the Rhine.” (<span class='it'>2233-H-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Confiscation of Property.</span> The conspirators had made plans
to confiscate the property of Poles, Jews, and dissident elements.
These plans were designed to accomplish a number of objectives.
Insofar as the Jews were concerned, they were part of the conspirators’
over-all program of extermination. Confiscation was also
a means of providing property for German settlers and of rewarding
those who had rendered faithful service to the Nazi State.
This phase of their program likewise made dispossessed Polish
farmers available for slave labor in Germany, and operated to
further the conspirators’ objective of preventing the growth of
another generation of Poles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Proof of these matters appears in a number of reports by
Kusche, who appears to have been one of Himmler’s chief deputies
in Poland. In one of these reports Kusche pointed out that it was
possible, without difficulty, to confiscate small farms and that
<span class='pageno' title='1036' id='Page_1036'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The former owners of Polish farms together with their
families will be transferred to the old Reich by the employment
agencies for employment as farm workers.” (<span class='it'>1352-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In another secret report by Kusche dated 22 May 1940, and
entitled “Details of the Confiscation in the Bielitz Country”, the
following appears:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Some days ago the commandant of the concentration camp
being built at Auschwitz spoke at Staff Leader Muller’s and
requested support for the carrying out of his assignments.
He said that it was absolutely necessary to confiscate the agricultural
enterprises within a certain area around the concentration
camp, since not only the fields but also the farm
houses of these border directly on the concentration camp. A
local inspection held on the 21st of this month revealed the
following: there is no room for doubt that agricultural enterprises
bordering on the concentration camp must be confiscated
at once. Further than this, the camp commandant
requests that further plots of farmland be placed at his disposal,
so that he can keep the prisoners busy. This too can
be done without further delay since enough land can be made
available for the purpose. The owners of the plots are all
Poles.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I had the following discussion with the head of the labor
office in Bielitz:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The lack of agricultural laborers still exists in the old Reich.
The transfer of the previous owners of the confiscated enterprises,
together with their entire families, to the Reich is possible
without any further consideration. It is only necessary
for the labor office to receive the lists of the persons in time,
in order to enable it to take the necessary steps (collection
of transportation, distribution over the various regions in
need of such labor)”.</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The confiscation of these Polish enterprises in Alzen will
also be carried out within the next few days. The commandant
of the concentration camp will furnish SS men and a
truck for the execution of the action. Should it not yet be
possible to take the Poles from Alzen to Auschwitz, they
should be transferred to the empty castle at Zator. The liberated
Polish property is to be given to the needy racial German
farmers for their use.” (<span class='it'>1352-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 17 September 1940, Goering issued a decree which was designed
to regularize the program of confiscation (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
<span class='pageno' title='1037' id='Page_1037'></span>
1940, Part I, page 1270). Under Section 2 of this decree,
sequestration of movable and immovable property, stores, and
other intangible property interests of Jews and “persons who
have fled or are not merely temporarily absent” was made mandatory.
In addition, sequestration was authorized under Section
2, sub-section 2, if the property were required “for the public
welfare, particularly in the interests of Reich defense or the
strengthening of Germanism.” By section 9 of the decree, confiscation
of sequestrated property was authorized “if the public
welfare, particularly the defense of the Reich, or the strengthening
of Germanism, so requires.” However, Section 1, sub-section
2, provided that property of German nationals was not subject to
sequestration and confiscation; and section 13 provided that sequestration
would be suspended if the owner of the property asserted
that he was a German. The decree, on its face, clearly indicates
a purpose to strip Poles, Jews, and dissident elements of
their property. It was, moreover, avowedly designed to promote
Germanism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently some question arose at one point as to whether the
decree required that a determination be made in each case involving
the property of a Pole that the property was required “for the
public welfare, particularly in the interests of Reich defense or
the strengthening of Germanism.” The answer supplied by the
conspirators was firm and clear: In <span class='it'>any</span> case in which the property
of a Pole was involved, the “strengthening of Germanism”
required its seizure. On 15 April 1941, on paper bearing the letterhead
of the Reich Leader SS, Commissioner for the Consolidation
of German Nationhood, instructions were given “for internal
use on the application of the law concerning property of the Poles
of 17 September 1940.” The following is an excerpt:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The conditions permitting seizure according to section II,
sub-section 2, are always present if the property belongs to
a Pole. For the Polish real estate will be needed without exception
for the consolidation of the German nationhood.”
(<span class='it'>R-92</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the Government-General, Frank promulgated a decree on 24
January 1940, authorizing sequestration “in connection with the
performance of tasks serving the public interest”, and liquidation
of “anti-social or financially unremunerative concerns.” The decree
is embodied in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> of the Government-General,
No. 6, 27 January 1940, page 23. The undefined criteria
in this decree clearly empowered Nazi officials in the Government-General
to engage in wholesale seizure of property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The magnitude of the conspirators’ confiscation program in
<span class='pageno' title='1038' id='Page_1038'></span>
Poland was staggering. The Nazis’ own statistics show that as
of 31 May 1943, a total of 693,252 estates, comprising 6,097,525
hectares, had been seized, and 9,508 estates, comprising 270,446
hectares had been confiscated by the Estate Offices Danzig-West
Prussia, Poznan, Zichenau, and Silesia (<span class='it'>R-92</span>). This, it will be
noted, represented the seizures and confiscations which were effected
by only four offices. Figures are not available at this time
for other offices maintained by the conspirators for these purposes.</p>

<h3>2. CZECHOSLOVAKIA</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The conspirators had given much thought to their plans to
Germanize Bohemia and Moravia. Three plans, each characterized
by severity, were discussed, and finally the Fuehrer decided
on plan (<span class='it'>c</span>), which involved the assimilation of about one-half the
Czech population by the Germans and the extermination of the
other half. Moreover, this plan envisaged a large influx into
Czechoslovakia of Germans whose loyalty to the Fuehrer was unquestioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These matters appear from a top secret report dated 15 October
1940, written by General Friderici, Deputy General of the Wehrmacht
in Bohemia and Moravia. On the face of the document, it
appears that only four copies were made. The original document
bears the handwritten letters “K” and “J” on the first page on
the left side, and the handwriting is unquestionably that of Keitel
and Jodl. The report states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 9 October of this year the office of the Reich Protector
held an official conference in which State Secretary SS Lt.
General K. H. Frank spoke about the following: [SS Gruppenfuehrer
K. H. Frank was Secretary of State under Von
Neurath, who at the date of this report was the Protector
of Bohemia and Moravia].</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Since creation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia,
Party agencies, industrial circles, as well as agencies of the
central authorities of Berlin have had difficulties about the
solution of the Czech problem.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“After ample deliberation, the Reich Protector expressed his
views about the various plans in a memorandum. In this
way, three ways of solution were indicated:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> German infiltration of Moravia and reduction of the
Czech nationality to a residual Bohemia. This solution is
considered unsatisfactory, because the Czech problem, even
if in a diminished form, will continue to exist.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> Many arguments can be brought up against the most
<span class='pageno' title='1039' id='Page_1039'></span>
radical solution, namely, the deportation of all the Czechs.
Therefore, the memorandum comes to the conclusion that it
cannot be carried out within a reasonable period of time.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> Assimilation of the Czechs, i.e., absorption of about half
of the Czech nationality by the Germans, insofar as this is of
importance by being valuable from a racial or other standpoint.
This will take place, among other things, also by increasing
the <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span> of the Czechs in the Reich territory
(with the exception of the Sudeten-German border district),
in other words, by dispersing the closed Czech nationality.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The other half of the Czech nationality must be deprived
of its power, eliminated and shipped out of the country by
all sorts of methods. This applies particularly to the racially
mongoloid part and to the major part of the intellectual
class. The latter can scarcely be converted ideologically and
would represent a burden by constantly making claims for
the leadership over the other Czech classes and thus interfering
with a rapid assimilation.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Elements which counteract the planned Germanization
ought to be handled roughly and should be eliminated.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The above development naturally presupposes an increased
influx of Germans from the Reich territory into the Protectorate.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“After a discussion, the Fuehrer has chosen solution (<span class='it'>c</span>) (Assimilation)
as a directive for the solution of the Czech problem
and decided that, while keeping up the autonomy of the
Protectorate on the surface, the Germanization will have to
be carried out in a centralized way by the office of the Reich
Protector for years to come.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“From the above no particular conclusions are drawn by the
armed forces. This is the direction which has always been
represented from here. In this connection, I refer to my
memorandum which was sent to the Chief of the Supreme
Command of the Armed Forces, dated 12 July 1939, file number
6/39, top secret, entitled: “The Czech Problem.” (Attached
as annex.)</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Deputy General of the Armed Forces with the Reich
Protector in Bohemia and Moravia.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>“(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;FRIDERICI</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Infantry Lt. General.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>862-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Solution (<span class='it'>a</span>), as outlined in the foregoing report, would have
called for German infiltration into Moravia and the forcible removal
of the Czechs from that area to Bohemia. Moravia lies
<span class='pageno' title='1040' id='Page_1040'></span>
between Bohemia and Slovakia. Thus, solution (<span class='it'>a</span>) would have
involved the erection of a German state between Bohemia and
Slovakia, and would have prevented effective inter-communications
between the Czechs and the Slovaks. In this manner, the
historic desire for unity of these two groups of people and the
continued existence of their Czechoslovakian State would have
been frustrated. Solution (<span class='it'>a</span>) was rejected because the surviving
Czechs, even though compressed into a “residual Bohemia,” would
have remained to plague the conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Solution (<span class='it'>b</span>), which involved the forcible deportation of all
Czechs, was rejected, not because its terms were deemed too drastic
but rather because a more speedy resolution of the problem
was desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Solution (<span class='it'>c</span>) was regarded as the most desirable, and was
adopted. This solution first provided for the assimilation of
about one-half of the Czechs. This meant two things: (<span class='it'>a</span>) enforced
Germanization for those who were deemed racially qualified,
and (<span class='it'>b</span>) deportation to slave labor in Germany for others.
“Increasing the <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span> of the Czechs in the Reich territory”,
as stated in the report, meant, in reality, slave labor in
Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Solution (<span class='it'>c</span>) further provided for the elimination and deportation
“by all sorts of methods” of the other half of the Czech population,
particularly intellectuals and those who did not meet Nazi
racial standards. Czech intellectuals, as the conspirators well
know, had a conspicuous record of resistance to the Nazi ideology.
They were, therefore, to be exterminated. That section of the
report which stated, “elements which counteract the planned Germanization
are to be handled roughly and should be eliminated,”
meant that intellectuals and other dissident elements were either
to be thrown in concentration camps or immediately exterminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In short, the provisions of solution (<span class='it'>c</span>) were simply a practical
application of the conspirators’ philosophy as expressed in Himmler’s
speech referred to above:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Either we win over any good blood that we can use for ourselves
* * * or we destroy this blood.” (<span class='it'>L-70</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>3. THE U. S. S. R.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>(The Chief Prosecutor for the Soviet Union has assumed the
task of introducing detailed evidence showing the results of the
execution of this program. The American prosecution confined
itself to showing the plan.)
<span class='pageno' title='1041' id='Page_1041'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence, individual items of which will be discussed hereafter,
shows the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. The conspirators planned to remove to Germany all foodstuffs
and raw materials from the south and southeast of the
Soviet Union, over and above the needs of the Nazi invading
forces and the absolute minimum necessary to supply the bare
needs of the people in these particular regions who produced the
materials which were to be removed to Germany. This region
had previously supplied the northern area of the Soviet Union,
which the conspirators called the “Forest Zone”. The latter zone
embraced some of the leading industrial areas of the Soviet Union,
including Moscow and Leningrad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>B. They deliberately and systematically planned to starve millions
of Russians. Starvation was to be accomplished by the
following means:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) As indicated under A above, products from the south and
southeast of the Soviet Union which ordinarily were sent to the
industrial regions of the north were to be forcibly diverted to
Germany. Moreover, all livestock in the industrial regions was
to be seized for use by the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> and the German civilian
population. The necessary consequence was that the population of
the northern regions would be reduced to starvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) They established the following order of priority in which
food produced by the Russians would be allocated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>First, the combat troops.</p>

<p class='noindent'>Second, the remainder of troops in enemy territory.</p>

<p class='noindent'>Third, troops stationed in Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>Fourth, the German civilian population, and</p>

<p class='noindent'>Lastly, the population of the occupied countries.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus, even Russians in the food-surplus area of the Ukraine, who
were not essential to the production of products for the German
war machine, were systematically to be starved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. They planned the permanent destruction of all industry in
the northern area of the Soviet Union in order that the remnants
of the Russian population would be completely dependent
upon Germany for consumer goods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>D. They planned to incorporate a part of Galicia and all of
the Baltic countries into Germany and to convert the Crimea, an
area north of the Crimea, the Volga territory, and the district
around Baku, into German colonies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a directive issued by Goering’s office for “The Operation of
the Economy in the newly-occupied Eastern Territories,” there
was established the Economic Executive Staff, East, which was
directly responsible to Goering, under which was created the
<span class='pageno' title='1042' id='Page_1042'></span>
Economic Staff, East. The Economic Staff, East, in turn was
subdivided into four groups: the Chief of the Economic Staff,
Group LA, Group W, and Group M. The functions of Group LA
were stated to be as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Group LA. (Functions: nutrition and agriculture, the economy
of all agricultural products, provision of supplies for
the Army, in cooperation with the Army groups concerned.)”
(<span class='it'>EC-472</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>A report was made on 23 May 1941 (which was before the invasion
of the Soviet Union) on the subject, “Economic Policy Directives
for Economic Organization, East, Agricultural Group.”
(<span class='it'>EC-126</span>). It was prepared by the Economic Staff, East, Group
LA, the Agricultural Group, which (as shown by <span class='it'>EC-472</span>) was
an important part of the organization which Goering had established
to formulate plans for the economic administration of
Russia. The report begins by a recitation of figures pertaining
to the production of agricultural products in the Soviet Union.
It states that the grain surplus of Russia is determined by the
level of domestic consumption and that this fact affords the basis
upon which the planners must predicate their actions and economic
policy. The report continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The surplus territories are situated in the black soil district
(that is in the south and southeast) and in the Caucasus.
The deficit areas are principally located in the forest
zone of the north. Therefore, an isolation of the black soil
areas must, in any case, place greater or lesser surpluses in
these regions at our disposal. The consequences will be
cessation of supplies to the entire forest zone, including the
essential industrial centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This (the cessation of supplies) means:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. All industry in the deficit area, particularly the manufacturing
industries in the Moscow and Petersburg regions
as well as the Ural industrial regions will be abandoned.
It may be assumed that these regions today absorb an annual
five to ten million tons from the food production zone.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. The Trans-Caucasian oil district will have to be excepted,
although it is a deficit area. This source of oil, cotton,
manganese, copper, silk, and tea must continue to be
supplied with food in any case, for special political and
economic reasons.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“3. No further exceptions with a view to preserving one or
<span class='pageno' title='1043' id='Page_1043'></span>
the other industrial region or industrial enterprise must be
permitted.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“4. Industry can only be preserved so far as it is located
in the surplus region. This applies, apart from the above-mentioned
oil field regions in the Caucasus, particularly to
the heavy industries in the Donets district (Ukraine). Only
the future will show to what extent it will prove possible
to maintain in full these industries, and in particular the
Ukrainian manufacturing industries, after the withdrawal
of the food surpluses required by Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The following consequences result from this situation,
which has received the approval of the highest authorities,
since it is in accord with the political tendencies (preservation
of the small Russians, preservation of the Caucasus, of
the Baltic provinces, of White Russia, to the prejudice of
the Great Russians).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I. <span class='it'>For the forest belt</span>:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> Production in the forest belt (the food-deficit area)
will become ‘naturalized,’ similar to the events during the
World War and the Communistic tendencies of the war, etc.,
namely: agriculture in that territory will begin to become
a mere ‘home production.’ The result will be that the planting
of products destined for the market such as, in particular,
flax and hemp, will be discontinued, and the area
used therefor will be taken over for products for the producer
(grain, potatoes, etc.) Moreover, discontinuance of
fodder for that area will lead to the collapse of the dairy
production and pig producing in that territory.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> Germany is not interested in the maintenance of the
productive power of these territories, except for supplying
the troops stationed there. The population, as in the old
days, will utilize arable land for growing its own food.
It is useless to expect grain or other surpluses to be produced.
Only after many years can these extensive regions
be intensified to an extent that they might produce genuine
surpluses. The population of these areas, in particular the
urban population, will have to face most serious distress
from famine. It will be necessary to divert the population
into the Siberian spaces. Since rail transport is out of the
question, this too, will be an extremely difficult problem.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> In this situation, Germany will only draw substantial advantages
by quick, nonrecurrent seizure, that is, it will be
vitally necessary to make the entire flax harvest available
<span class='pageno' title='1044' id='Page_1044'></span>
for German needs, not only the fibers but also the oleaginous
seeds.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It will also be necessary to utilize for German purposes the
livestock which has no fodder base of its own, that is, it will
be necessary <span class='it'>to seize livestock holdings</span> immediately, and
to make them available to the troops not only for the moment,
but in the long run, and also for exportation to Germany.
Since fodder supplies will be cut off, pig and cattle
holdings in these areas will of necessity drastically decline in
the near future. If they are not seized by the Germans at
an early date, they will be slaughtered by the population for
its own use, without Germany getting anything out of it.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It has been demanded by the Fuehrer that the reduction in
the meat ration should be made good by the fall. This can
only be achieved by the most drastic seizures of Russian
livestock holdings, particularly in areas which are in a favorable
transport situation in relation to Germany.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In future, southern Russia must turn its face toward
Europe. Its food surpluses, however, will only be paid for
if it purchases its industrial consumer goods from Germany,
or Europe. Russian competition from the forest zone must,
therefore, be abolished.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It follows from all that has been said that the German administration
in these territories may well attempt to mitigate
the consequences of the famine which undoubtedly will
take place, and to accelerate the return to primitive agricultural
conditions. An attempt might be made to intensify
cultivation in these areas by expanding the acreage under
potatoes or other important food crops giving a high yield.
However, these measures will not avert famine. Many tens
of millions of people in this area will become redundant
and will either die or have to emigrate to Siberia. Any
attempt to save the population there from death by starvation
by importing surpluses from the black soil zone would
be at the expense of supplies to Europe. It would reduce
Germany’s staying power in the war, and would undermine
Germany’s and Europe’s power to resist the blockade. This
must be clearly and absolutely understood.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I. Supplies for the Army</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany’s food situation in the third year of war demands
<span class='pageno' title='1045' id='Page_1045'></span>
it imperatively that the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>, in all its provisioning,
must not live off Greater German territory or that of incorporated
or friendly areas from which this territory receives
imports. This minimum aim, the provisioning of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>
from enemy territory in the third year, and if necessary
in later years, must be attained at any price. This
means that one-third of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> must be fully provisioned
by French deliveries to the army of occupation.
The remaining two-thirds (and even slightly more in view
of the present size of the Wehrmacht) must without exception
be provisioned from the Eastern <span class='it'>space</span>.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Thus it is not important, under any circumstances, to preserve
what has existed, but what matters is a deliberate
turning away from the existing situation and introducing
Russian food resources into the European framework. This
will inevitably result in an extinction of industry as well as
a large part of the people in what so far have been the
food-deficit areas.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is impossible to state an alternative in sufficiently hard
and severe terms.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Our problem is not to replace intensive food production
in Europe through the incorporation of new space in the
East, but to replace imports from overseas by imports from
the East. The task is twofold:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. We must use the eastern spaces for overcoming the
food shortages during and after the war. This means that
we must not be afraid of drawing upon the capital substance
of the East. Such an intervention is much more acceptable
from the European standpoint than drawing upon
the capital substance of Europe’s agriculture.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. For the future new order, the food-producing areas in
the East must be turned into a permanent and substantial
complementary source of food for Europe, through intensified
cultivation and resulting higher yields.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The first-named task must be accomplished at any price,
even through the most ruthless cutting down of Russian
domestic consumption, which will require discrimination

<p class='noindent'>It is submitted that this document discloses, on its face, a
studied plan to murder millions of people through starvation.
<span class='pageno' title='1046' id='Page_1046'></span>
It reveals a program of premeditated murder on a scale so vast
as to stagger human imagination. This plan was the logical
culmination of general objectives clearly announced by Adolf
Hitler in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>. (See Section 6 of Chapter IX.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A top secret memorandum, dated 16 July, 1941, of a conference
at the Fuehrer’s headquarters concerning the war in the
East, seems to have been prepared by Bormann, because his
initials appear at the top of page one (<span class='it'>L-221</span>). The text of the
memorandum indicates that the conference was attended by
Hitler, Lammers, Goering, Keitel, Rosenberg, and Bormann.
This memorandum throws light upon the conspirators’ plans
to Germanize conquered areas of the Soviet Union. It also discloses
the fraudulent character of the Nazi propaganda program;
and shows how the conspirators sought to deceive the
entire world; how they pretended to pursue one course of
action when their aims and purposes were to follow precisely
the opposite course. The following portions are particularly
relevant.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Now it was essential that we did not publicize our aims before
the world; also there was no need for that, but the main
thing was that we ourselves knew what we wanted. By no
means should we render our task more difficult by making
superfluous declarations. Such declarations were superfluous
because we could do everything wherever we had the power,
and what was beyond our power we would not be able to do
anyway.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“What we told the world about the motives for our measures
ought to be conditioned, therefore, by tactical reasons. We
ought to act here in exactly the same way as we did in the
cases of Norway, Denmark, Holland, and Belgium. In these
cases too we did not publish our aims, and it was only sensible
to continue in the same way.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Therefore, we shall emphasize again that we were forced to
occupy, administer, and secure a certain area; it was in the
interest of the inhabitants that we provided order, food, traffic,
etc., hence our measures. Nobody shall be able to recognize
that it initiates final settlement. This need not prevent
our taking all necessary measures—shooting, de-settling, etc.—and
we shall take them.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“But we do not want to make any people into enemies prematurely
and unnecessarily. Therefore we shall act as
though we wanted to exercise a mandate only. At the same
<span class='pageno' title='1047' id='Page_1047'></span>
time we must know clearly that we shall never leave those
countries.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Our conduct therefore ought to be:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. To do nothing which might obstruct the final settlement,
but to prepare for it only in secret. * * *”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. To emphasize that we are liberators.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“In particular: The Crimea has to be evacuated by all foreigners
and to be settled by Germans only. In the same way
the former Austrian part of Galicia will become Reich territory.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Our present relations with Roumania are good, but nobody
knows what they will be at any future time. This we have
to consider, and we have to draw our frontiers accordingly.
One ought not to be dependent on the good will of other
people. We have to plan our relations with Roumania in
accordance with this principle.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“On principle, we have now to face the task of cutting up the
giant cake according to our needs, in order to be able—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“first, to dominate it;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“second, to administer it, and;</p>

<p class='noindent'>“third, to exploit it.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“The Russians have now ordered partisan warfare behind
our front. This partisan war again has some advantage for
us; it enables us to eradicate everyone who opposes us.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Principles: Never again must it be possible to create a military
power west of the Urals, even if we have to wage war
for a hundred years in order to attain this goal. Every successor
of the Fuehrer should know: security for the Reich
exists only if there are no foreign military forces west of the
Urals; it is Germany who undertakes the protection of this
area against all possible danger. Our iron principle is and
has to remain: We must never permit anybody but the Germans
to carry arms.”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer emphasizes that the entire Baltic country will
have to be incorporated into Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“At the same time the Crimea, including a considerable hinterland,
(situated north of the Crimea) should become Reich
territory; the hinterland should be as large as possible.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Rosenberg objects to this because of the Ukrainians living
there.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Incidental question: It occurred to me several times that
<span class='pageno' title='1048' id='Page_1048'></span>
Rosenberg has a soft spot for the Ukrainians; thus he desires
to aggrandize the former Ukraine to a considerable extent.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer emphasizes furthermore that the Volga Colony,
too, will have to become Reich territory, also the district
around Baku; the latter will have to become a German concession
(military colony).”</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Finns wanted East Carelia, but the Kola Peninsula will
be taken by Germany because of the large nickel mines there.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The annexation of Finland as a federated state should be
prepared with caution. The area around Leningrad is
wanted by the Finns; the Fuehrer will raze Leningrad to the
ground and then hand it over to the Finns.” (<span class='it'>L-221</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus, the program, as outlined by the conspirators at this meeting
of 16 July, 1941, called for the unlawful incorporation of a part
of Galicia and all the Baltic countries into Germany; and for the
unlawful conversion of the Crimea and areas north of it, the
Volga territory and the district around Baku, into German colonies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This point is reinforced by a directive entitled, “Instruction
for a Reich Commissar in the Baltic Countries and White Russia,”
which states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The aim of a Reich Commissar for Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
and White Russia [last two words added in pencil]
must be to strive to achieve the form of a German protectorate,
and then transform the region into part of the Greater
German Reich by Germanizing racially possible elements,
colonizing Germanic races, and banishing undesirable elements.
The Baltic Sea must become a Germanic inland sea,
under the guardianship of Greater Germany.” (<span class='it'>1029-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Even in the food-surplus areas of the occupied regions of the
Ukraine, the conspirators planned to allocate food on a basis
which left virtually nothing for those persons who were not engaged
in the compulsory production of commodities for the German
war machine. This was in violation of the explicit provision
in Article 52 of the Hague Regulations of 1907, that requisitions
in kind and services shall not be demanded from municipalities or
inhabitants except for the needs of the army of occupation. This
program was disclosed in a top secret memorandum, dated 18
September, 1941, concerning a meeting of German military officials
presided over by Goering (<span class='it'>EC-3</span>). The memorandum was
signed by General Nagl, liaison officer between Goering’s Four
Year Plan Office and the OKW. The memorandum states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“At this conference which was concerned with the better exploitation
<span class='pageno' title='1049' id='Page_1049'></span>
of the occupied territories for the German food
economy, the Reich Marshal (Goering) called attention to
the following:”</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“It is clear that a graduated scale of food allocations is
needed.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“First in line are the combat troops, then the remainder of
troops in enemy territory, and then those troops stationed
at home. The rates are adjusted accordingly. The supply
of the German nonmilitary population follows and only then
comes the population of the occupied territories.” (<span class='it'>EC-3</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another memorandum, dated 25 November 1941, relating to the
general principles of economic policy in the newly-occupied eastern
territories, as prescribed in a conference held in Berlin on 8 November
1941, also bears out this point. This memorandum was
also written by General Nagl. It is on the stationery of the Supreme
Headquarters Armament Procurement Office. The following
portions are pertinent:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I. For the duration of the war the requirements of the war
economy will be the all-dominant factor of any economic
measures in the newly-occupied Eastern territories.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“II. Seen from a long range point of view the newly-occupied
eastern areas will be exploited economically from the point of
view of colonial administration and by colonial methods.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Exceptions will be made only for those parts of the Eastland
which are to be Germanized by order of the Fuehrer,
but even they are subject to the principle expressed in paragraph
I.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“III. The main emphasis of all economic work rests with the
production of food and raw materials.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The highest possible production surplus for the supply of
the Reich and of other European countries is to be attained
by cheap production based on the maintenance of the low
living standard of the native population. Besides covering
thereby the European needs for food supplies and raw materials
as far as possible, this measure is intended to create
a source of income for the Reich which will make it possible
to liquidate in a few decades, with utmost consideration for
the German taxpayer, an essential part of the debts incurred
in the financing of the war.” (<span class='it'>EC-3</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 17 July, 1941, Hitler and Keitel issued a decree appointing
Rosenberg as Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories.
This was the day following the meeting at the Fuehrer’s
<span class='pageno' title='1050' id='Page_1050'></span>
headquarters, which is reported in the document previously quoted
from (<span class='it'>L-221</span>). This decree states, <span class='it'>inter alia</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Civil Administration in the newly-occupied Eastern
territories where these territories are not included in the administration
of the territories bordering on the Reich or the
Government-General, is subject to the Reich Minister for the
Occupied Eastern Territories.</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I appoint Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg as Reich Minister
for the occupied Eastern territories. He will hold office in
Berlin.” (<span class='it'>1997-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Rosenberg’s views well fitted him for his task as one of the chief
executioners of the conspirators’ plans in the Soviet Union. His
views were plainly expressed in a speech delivered on 20 June
1941:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The job of feeding the German people, stands, this year,
without a doubt, at the top of the list of Germany’s claims on
the East; and here the southern territories and the northern
Caucasus will have to serve as a balance for the feeding of
the German people. We see absolutely no reason for any
obligation on our part to feed also the Russian people with
the products of that surplus territory. We know that this is
a harsh necessity, bare of any feelings.” (<span class='it'>1058-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>These views were implemented in the directives issued by Rosenberg
in his capacity as Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern
Territories. Among his directives were these:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The principal task of the civilian administration in the occupied
Eastern territories is to represent the interest of the
Reich. This basic principle is to be given precedence in all
measures and considerations. Therefore, the occupied territories,
in the future, may be permitted to have a life of their
own in a form not as yet to be determined. However, they
remain parts of the Greater German living space and are always
to be governed according to this guiding principle.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The regulations of the Hague Convention on Land Warfare,
which concern the administration of a country occupied
by a foreign belligerent power, are not applicable, since
the USSR is to be considered dissolved, and therefore the
Reich has the obligation of exercising all governmental and
other sovereign functions in the interests of the country’s
inhabitants. Therefore, any measures are permitted which
the German administration deems necessary and suitable for
the execution of this comprehensive task.” (<span class='it'>EC-347</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='1051' id='Page_1051'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Implicit in Rosenberg’s statement that the Hague Regulations
are not applicable to the Soviet Union is the recognition by him
that the conspirators’ action in the Soviet Union flagrantly violated
the Hague Regulations and applicable principles of International
Law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A top secret memorandum, dated 5 October 1942, written by
Braeutigam, who was a high official in Rosenberg’s Ministry
for the Occupied Eastern Territories, made the following statements:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the East, Germany is carrying on a threefold war: a
war for the destruction of Bolshevism, a war for the destruction
of the greater Russian Empire, and finally a war
for the acquisition of colonial territory for colonizing purposes
and economic exploitation.</p>

<p class='noindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='noindent'>“With the inherent instinct of the Eastern peoples the primitive
man soon found out also that for Germany the slogan:
‘Liberation from Bolshevism’ was only a pretext to enslave
the Eastern peoples according to her own methods.” (<span class='it'>294-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Certain German industrialists and financiers aided and abetted
Himmler in his relentless program of Germanization, exploitation,
oppression, and destruction. A letter from the banker,
Baron Kurt von Schroeder to Himmler, dated 27 August 1943,
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“My very honorable Reichsfuehrer:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“With great joy I learn of your appointment as Reichsminister
of the Interior and take the liberty to extend my heartiest
congratulations to you on assuming your new post.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A strong hand is now very necessary in the operation of
this Department and it is universally welcomed but especially
by your friends that it was you who were chosen for
this by the Fuehrer. Please be assured that we will always
do everything in our power at all times to assist you in every
possible way.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I am pleased to inform you at this opportunity that your
circle of friends has again placed at your disposal this year
a sum slightly in excess of RM 1 million for ‘special purposes.’
An exact list showing the name of the contributors
will be sent to you shortly.</p>

family—I remain yours, in old loyalty and esteem.</p>

<p class='noindent'>A later letter from von Schroeder to Himmler, dated 21 September
1943, enclosed the list of contributors. The letter stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dear Reichsleader:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“I thank you very much for your kind letter of the 14th of

same time, I am enclosing a list with the total amount of
funds made available to you by your circle of friends and
totalling RM 1,000,000. We are very glad indeed to render
some assistance to you in your special tasks and to be able to
provide some small relief for you in your still further extended
sphere of duties.</p>

<p class='noindent'>The Himmler “circle of friends,” it may be noted, was a relatively
small, select group. It did not include all, or even a majority
of the industrialists and financiers in Germany. These
contributions were not like the “<span class='it'>Hitler Spende</span>” or the Winter
Relief contributions which were exacted from all industrialists
by the Nazi state. These were contributions by a small group
of very influential industrialists and financiers who, for selfish
reasons, were anxious to “do everything in our power at all
times to assist you “(Himmler)” in every possible way.” By a
rather strange coincidence, firms like I. G. Farben, the Flick
Combine, and the Herman Goering Werke, which are on the list
of contributors to Himmler, were among the chief beneficiaries
of the conspirators’ program of plunder of public and private
property in the occupied countries. (<span class='it'>EC-453</span>)</p>

<h3>4. THE WESTERN OCCUPIED COUNTRIES</h3>

<p class='pindent'>(This section is based on a brief originally prepared for submission
by the United States Prosecution in support of the allegation,
in Count One of the Indictment, of a plan or conspiracy to commit
war crimes. The evidence relating to the plan or conspiracy,
however, proved to be inseparable from that on the execution
thereof, a subject assigned to the French Prosecution. The materials
contained herein were accordingly made available to the
French for such use as they might deem appropriate in connection
with the proof of their case.)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>The Nazi Conspirators Obtained Enormous Quantities of
Foodstuffs, Raw Materials and Equipment From the Occupied
Western Countries.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='1053' id='Page_1053'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Nazis planned in advance of the invasion to secure
from the conquered territories the strategic materials which Germany
lacked and without which Germany could not prevail in a
war of long duration.</span> In this war, as in the last, German resources
were sufficient only for a conflict of short duration. As
early as the winter of 1939-40, following the swift and crushing
defeat of Poland, Germany suffered from a critical shortage of
essential raw materials (<span class='it'>EC-615</span>). The Nazi leaders were thus
faced with the question whether to conserve their supplies for a
long war or to commit their limited reserves in the hope of obtaining
an early decision. Hitler decided on the latter course.
As Goering told General Thomas:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer is firmly convinced that he will succeed in
reaching a decision * * * in the year 1940 by a big attack
in the West. He reckons that Belgium, Holland, and
Northern France will get into our possession and * * *
had figured out that the industrial areas of Douai and Lens
and those of Luxembourg, Longwy, and Briey could, from the
point of view of raw material, replace the supplies from
Sweden. Therefore, the Fuehrer had decided now to make
use of our reserve of raw materials without regard to future
times. * * *” (<span class='it'>EC-606</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Careful plans were made in advance of the invasion in 1940 to
secure for Germany the raw material resources of the to-be-occupied
countries. A manual of directives and decrees issued
by the Quartermaster, OKH, for the economic administration of
the military government set forth an exhaustive list of important
raw materials to be seized wherever found (<span class='it'>EC-155</span>). Directives
were issued to the so-called economic squads (<span class='it'>Wirtschafts Truppe</span>)
attached to the tactical units on the procedures to be followed in
locating, seizing, and preparing such materials for shipment to
Germany (<span class='it'>EC-618</span>). Also included in the manual mentioned
were drafts of decrees to be promulgated by the German occupation
authorities, for the establishment in the occupied countries
of Goods Offices, modeled after the German rationing boards, to
control production and distribution in the occupied countries in
the German interest. (<span class='it'>EC-155</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The occupied Western countries were ruthlessly exploited
according to plan.</span> The occupied areas were systematically stripped
of their economic resources to feed the German war machine. The
extent of German exploitation is partially indicated by the staggering
totals of the occupation levies and the “credit” balances
of the local central banks under clearing arrangements imposed
<span class='pageno' title='1054' id='Page_1054'></span>
by the Nazis, the principal sources of the funds with which Germany
financed the spoliation of Western Europe. (For a brief
explanation of the clearing system, see <span class='it'>infra</span> under D, 2.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The total occupation charges exacted from France alone were
31,600,000,000 RM from 25 June, 1940, to 5 September, 1944
(<span class='it'>3615-PS</span>). They averaged more than 7,000,000,000 RM annually,
a sum more than four times the German annual payments
under the Dawes and Young Plans. This sum is in addition to a
“credit” of the Bank of France under the Franco-German clearing,
which, as of September, 1943, amounted to 4,400,000,000 RM
(<span class='it'>3615-PS</span>). For the period May 1942-43, the tribute exacted
from Belgium (mainly from occupation charges and clearing
credits) amounted to more than two-thirds of the Belgium national
income (<span class='it'>ECR-149</span>). These figures, large as they are, take
no account of the substantial quantities of materials seized and
removed to the Reich without compensation (see <span class='it'>infra</span> under B,
(1)) nor do they reflect the windfall to the Reich resulting from
the substantial over-valuation of the Reichsmark, particularly in
the case of France and Belgium. (<span class='it'>EC-86</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few illustrative examples of specific items, taken from the
report of the German Military Commander for France of 10 September,
1942 (<span class='it'>EC-267</span>), will serve to show even more concretely
than monetary figures, the extent to which materials and equipment
were taken from the occupied countries for the benefit of
the Reich. Since the Armistice, according to this report, the
French contributed to the Germans 73 percent of the normal annual
French consumption of iron, amounting to nearly 5 million
tons. From the Armistice to July, 1942, 225,000 tons of copper
and 5,700 tons of nickel were delivered by France to Germany,
amounting to 80 percent and 86 percent of French supplies respectively;
also 55 percent of the French aluminum and 80 percent
of the magnesium production. For her own needs France retained
only 30 percent of the normal production of the wool industry,
16 percent of the cotton production, and 13 percent of the
linen production. The total French production of locomotives and
the major part of the machine tool industry were put at the disposal
of the Germans. (<span class='it'>EC-267</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>B. <span class='it'>The Foodstuffs, Raw Materials and Equipment Delivered to
Germany were Obtained by Compelling the Nationals of the
Conquered Countries to Produce and Distribute in Accordance
with German War Requirements, by Seizure and Requisition, and
by Purchases Financed with Funds Exacted from the Occupied
Countries and Their Nationals.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='1055' id='Page_1055'></span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Much of the material and equipment removed to Germany
was obtained by seizure, requisition, and confiscation of private
property.</span> During the first phase of the occupation, the Nazis
systematically removed to the Reich almost all available supplies
to satisfy the immediate German requirements. This phase, according
to the German Military Commander’s description of the
practice in France, was one of “stripping” occupied areas of
“foodstuffs, raw materials and machinery”, leaving only enough
to secure the “bare subsistence” of the population (<span class='it'>EC-614</span>). In
the words of the report of the Wi-Rue Staff in France:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In this period the legal concepts of the Hague Regulations
regarding Land Warfare are not yet strictly observed. The
main purpose is to get out of France through seizure <span class='it'>Beschlagnahme</span>
or purchase at infinitesimal prices the materials
of use for the German armament.” (<span class='it'>EC-422</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>By order of the German High Command, booty was defined to include
not merely public property but “beyond the Hague Regulations
on Land Warfare,” also “privately owned finished and semi-finished
products if they were manufactured in fulfillment of an
order of the French armed forces” (<span class='it'>EC-422</span>). At the same time,
payments made by the French armed forces on account of war
material orders were likewise treated as war booty. Even goods
in transit were arbitrarily placed in this category (<span class='it'>EC-422</span>). Machinery
and equipment affixed to the realty were seized and
shipped to Germany in wilful disregard of the limitations of the
Hague Regulations authorizing seizure only of chattels. (<span class='it'>EC-84</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “stripping phase” of Nazi spoliation was relatively short-lived.
Decision was soon reached to utilize at least part of the
industrial capacity of the occupied areas to relieve the burden
on the armament plants in Germany (<span class='it'>EC-620</span>). Throughout the
period of occupation, however, the Nazis continued the seizure
and requisition of machinery and certain raw materials in short
supply in the Reich. From December, 1942, to the end of the
occupation, for example, 242 German demands for Belgian machinery
were met, of which 110 were fulfilled by requisitions
(<span class='it'>ECH-10</span>). In 79 instances the requisitioned equipment was
shipped to Germany. (<span class='it'>ECH-10</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Support for such requisitions was found in an order of the
Military Commander of Belgium of 6 August 1942. This order
was explained as embodying the “modern” German view that,
as “total war is no longer limited in space but has become a
struggle of peoples and nations against each other,” requisitions
under Article 52 of the Hague Regulations should no longer be
<span class='pageno' title='1056' id='Page_1056'></span>
limited to the “needs of the occupying forces” but may also be
used in the “general interest of the German war effort”; and
that requisitioned articles may be used not only in the territory
in which they were obtained but also “in other territories in the
sphere of the occupying power.” (<span class='it'>ECH-10</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In April 1941, Goering ordered the removal of church bells in
France “which represent the most important and last reserve
of copper and tin,” stressing that “no church bells would be removed
in Germany before all bells had been removed in France”
(<span class='it'>EC-323</span>). In 1943, after the removal of church bells from the
other occupied countries and even from the Reich, Hitler ordered
their removal from Belgium (<span class='it'>ECH-11</span>). The Belgians protested,
invoking the Hague Regulations, and refused an offer to buy;
thereupon the Germans requisitioned the bells against receipt.
(<span class='it'>ECH-11</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By circular letter, dated 23 June 1943, Speer ordered that
scientific instruments and apparatus be taken out of the laboratories
and research institutes in the occupied Western countries,
directing that applications for instruments be made through
channels and that the requisitions be made by the Military Government.
(<span class='it'>ECH-14</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In many cases, representatives of German scientific institutions
sought to acquire scientific instruments in order to modernize
their own installations, appearing in Army uniforms to
give the impression that the requisition was a military measure
(<span class='it'>ECH-15</span>). The Military Government of Belgium decided that
Articles 52 and 56 of the Hague Regulations were inapplicable
because the Allies had destroyed a number of German scientific
installations in the Reich through bombing, which therefore had
to be replaced from the occupied territories, and that “in a total
war, no consideration could be given to the cited articles of the
Hague Regulations”. (<span class='it'>ECH-16</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As part of the design to supply the armament industry in Germany
with material from the occupied Western territories, a
program for the removal of copper and lead from transmission
installations of power distribution plants in the occupied Western
countries was instituted by a decree of Speer dated 31 May,
1943 (<span class='it'>EC-101</span>). The plan contemplated from the outset that
the transmission of facilities would not be restored (as required
by the second paragraph of Article 53 of the Hague Regulations)
but that an equivalent amount of metal would be returned after
the war. (<span class='it'>EC-101</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Nazis purchased war materials and consumer goods</span>
<span class='pageno' title='1057' id='Page_1057'></span>
<span class='it'>in the regular and black markets for shipment to the Reich, all
with funds exacted from the occupied countries.</span> Following the
initial “stripping” phase of the occupation, the Nazis promptly
instituted an extensive “buying-out” program (<span class='it'>061-PS</span>) with
the object of procuring not merely materials required for the
German war effort, but to obtain also consumer goods, including
luxury items, for the civilian population of Germany (<span class='it'>EC-485</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>No limitations, legal or moral, were observed in the execution
of this program. Supplies which could not be obtained
through normal channels were purchased on the black market.
The disastrous effects of competition among various German
agents led the central occupational authorities in Belgium,
France, and Holland to take over black market operation directly
(<span class='it'>1765-PS</span>). On 13 June 1942, by order of Goering, Col. Veltjens
was appointed to direct black market purchases in all occupied
territories and a new agency, the so-called UEWA, was
placed at his disposal. (<span class='it'>ECH-7</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The actual purchases were made by several corporations, including
Pimetex, an agency of the Speer Ministry of Armament
and Munitions. The goods were distributed through Roges according
to directives of the Central Planning Board (Speer,
Koerner, Milch) and in appropriate cases by the German Ministry
of Economics and the <span class='it'>Reichsstellen</span> (<span class='it'>ECH-7</span>). Black market
operations were finally abolished by order of Goering dated 2
April, 1943, confirmed in Belgium by circular of the Military
Commander of 19 June, 1943. (<span class='it'>ECH-9</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certain of the purchases made through the black market
while under the direction of Col. Veltjens are of special interest:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Christmas Drive.</span> On 22 September 1942, Goering ordered
a special drive in the Western occupied countries to purchase
presents for the civil population in Germany for the coming
Christmas. The Roges Company effected the distribution
of the articles in Germany.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Special Drive WABO.</span> This drive was pursuant to Hitler’s
order to Speer to procure Christmas packages for the soldiers.
The O. Todt Cantine accepted offers of sale on the
black market and Pimetex did the buying.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Special Drive LOWA</span> (Degenkolb locomotive program). The
purchase were made by Pimetex. (<span class='it'>ECH-7</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>As of 15 January 1943, black market purchases totaled approximately
1,100,000,000 RM, including:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right80percent'>

<p class='noindent'>RM 929,100,000 in France.</p>

<p class='noindent'>RM 103,881,929 in Belgium, and</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='1058' id='Page_1058'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Payment in France was made out of occupation funds, in Belgium
out of such funds and through the clearing, and in Holland
through “normal bank transactions” (<span class='it'>1765-PS</span>; <span class='it'>ECR-132</span>). As
appears very clearly from the report of Col. Veltjens of 15 January,
1943, substantially all the goods so purchased were shipped
to the Reich. (<span class='it'>1765-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators compelled the nationals of the occupied
countries to produce and distribute materials and equipment
in accordance with the German general war requirements.</span>
The “stripping” and “buying-out” phases of the Nazi spoliation
were both gradually superseded by a regulated program for the
utilization of the industrial plant of the occupied areas and the
transfer of orders (subcontracting) to local concerns. The Nazi
conspirators established comprehensive rationing controls under
which essential raw materials were made available only to those
who produced in the German interest; those reluctant to produce
on German order were placed under compulsory administration.
“This,” Keitel noted in commenting on the controls established in
France, “is * * * booty of the victor”. (<span class='it'>EC-613</span>)</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'><span class='it'>Belgium</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The means employed in Belgium were typical. Production
quotas for coal, iron and steel, textiles and leather, and other
products were fixed by the Ministry of Economics and its <span class='it'>Reichsstellen</span>,
in some cases after consultation with the Reich Minister
(Funk). (<span class='it'>ECH-2</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Comprehensive production controls were established in Belgium
to assure the fulfillment of these quotas. Pursuant to plans developed
in advance of the invasion (<span class='it'>EC-155</span>), a decree was issued
by the Military Commander on 27 May, 1940, creating so-called
“Goods Offices,” endowed with authority to issue general and
special orders to Belgian firms requiring production of designated
products, and the sale thereof to designated buyers, and with the
further power to prohibit production or sale without license
(<span class='it'>3604-PS</span>). By decree of the Military Commander of 29 April,
1941, the appointment of a commissar to direct operations of private
plants was authorized. (<span class='it'>3610-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Goods Offices (<span class='it'>ECH-3</span>) were transferred to similar
units established by Belgian decree of 3 September, 1940.
(Whether this decree was issued on German order or suggestion
does not appear.) The Germans supervised the Belgian Goods
Offices and adopted as German orders both the Belgian decree
establishing the Offices and the orders issued thereunder, and
<span class='pageno' title='1059' id='Page_1059'></span>
prescribed punishment by fine and imprisonment for violations.
(<span class='it'>3609-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first two years of the occupation, German control was
exercised mainly through prohibitions and restrictions, that is,
by a priority system (<span class='it'>ECH-4</span>), although even then important
sectors of the Belgian economy, notably textiles and leather products,
were controlled by “positive” orders directing the amount
in kind to be produced and the persons to whom distribution
must be made (<span class='it'>ECH-4</span>; <span class='it'>ECH-2</span>). During this period the Military
Commander issued instructions to the Goods Offices through
“command channels,” that is, through the Belgian Minister of
Economics. (<span class='it'>ECH-3</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 6 August, 1942, the Military Commander, however, published
a decree reaffirming explicitly the power to compel production
of designated articles (<span class='it'>3612-PS</span>), a signal for the introduction
of “positive” controls. In 1943, on instructions from the Reich
Ministry of Economics, German representatives selected from the
<span class='it'>Reichsstellen</span> were attached directly to the Belgian Goods Offices
(<span class='it'>ECH-3</span>). At the end of 1943, the office of the “Ruestungsobmann”
of the Speer Ministry for Armaments and War Production
began issuing “positive orders” for production to individual concerns
directly, without clearing with the Goods Offices, pursuant
to decree of the Minister for Armaments and War Production
(Speer). (<span class='it'>ECH-3</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Production facilities in Belgium which were not deemed to
serve the German interest were shut down. By order of 30 March
1942, the Military Commander prohibited the enlargement of existing
plants and the construction of new ones without German
authorization, and provided for the closing down of factories at
his discretion (<span class='it'>3616-PS</span>). In the iron and metal industry alone
at least 400 plants “not important for the war effort” had been
closed down by 15 April 1943 (<span class='it'>EC-335</span>). By the end of the occupation,
1360 put of a total of 2164 plants in the textile industry
had been closed down. (<span class='it'>ECH-19</span>)</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'><span class='it'>France and Holland</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Substantially the same system was put into effect in France
and Holland. German Goods Offices were established in Occupied
France at the same time as in Belgium (<span class='it'>3604-PS</span>). These
were subsequently abolished in November, 1940, however, when
the Vichy Government, at the “suggestion” of the Nazis, created
raw material rationing boards, on which delegates of the German
Military Administration served as technical advisers (<span class='it'>EC-613</span>;
<span class='it'>EC-616</span>). In the Netherlands, controls were exercised by the
<span class='pageno' title='1060' id='Page_1060'></span>
local German Armament Inspectorate (<span class='it'>EC-471</span>; <span class='it'>EC-472-A</span>), who,
it is believed, made use of the rationing boards set up in Holland
before the outbreak of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>The Nazi Conspirators Acquired Ownership of Belgian,
Dutch, and French Participations in European Industries by
Means of Governmental Pressure and Through the Use of Funds
Unlawfully Exacted from the Occupied Countries and Their
Nationals.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators were not content with securing for Germany
the supplies necessary for the period of the war. They
aimed at obtaining permanent ownership and domination of European
industry to the fullest extent possible, and embarked on a
program to that end even during the progress of the war.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators established a program to acquire
for German interests ownership of Belgian, Dutch, and French
participations during the war.</span> On 23 May 1940, recommendation
was made that it would be opportune to secure all Dutch and Belgian
stocks “in order, especially in the case of holding companies,
to win influence * * * over the controlled companies” (<span class='it'>EC-41</span>).
The memorandum recommended the taking possession of
stocks of the dominated companies located in foreign countries
and influencing the decisions of members of holding companies
located in Holland and Belgium or of other owners of such stock.
Because of the provisions of Article 46 of the Hague Regulations
prohibiting confiscation of private property, it was deemed more
advisable to influence members of holding companies through
careful guiding than through plain force. (<span class='it'>EC-41</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a meeting held in the Reich Ministry of Economics on 3
June 1940 on the subject of “Belgian and Dutch capital shares
in southeastern European countries,” it was decided that regulations
should be issued immediately by the Military Commander
for Belgium prohibiting the destruction, transfer, or disposition
of any bonds or stocks of these countries, and that registration
should be required of owners and trustees. (<span class='it'>1445-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a memorandum of 2 August 1940 Goering declared that the
goal of the Germans’ economic policy was the “increase of German
influence with foreign enterprises,” that it was “necessary
already now that any opportunity is used to make it possible for
the German economy to start the penetration even during the war
of the interesting objects of the economy of the occupied countries,”
and directed that the transfer of capital from Germany to
<span class='pageno' title='1061' id='Page_1061'></span>
the occupied countries be facilitated to make possible the immediate
purchase of enterprises in the occupied countries. (<span class='it'>EC-137</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a meeting at the Reich Ministry of Economics on 8 August
1940 on the subject of “Acquisition of shares of important foreign
enterprises in southeastern Europe,” Dr. Schlotterer of the Reich
Ministry of Economics commented that “private economical penetration
of the Southeast area by German influence is desirable,
likewise the supplanting of British and French interests in that
territory” (<span class='it'>EC-43</span>). The group present, including representatives
of the Reich Ministry of Economics and the Reichsbank,
agreed that “attempts should be made immediately to acquire
shares” and that “in doing so the tendency should be preserved
to present a bill for the shares at the peace conference.” It was
further agreed that “it should be attempted if possible to transfer
the shares into private hands” but that “in order to make the
right selection it appears necessary to introduce an intermediary
stage” in which “first of all, enterprises should be taken over
through banks, thereupon the plants should be managed as a matter
of trusteeship for the Reich with the aim that the Reich (Reich
Marshal Goering)” undertake handing them over to private industry.
(<span class='it'>EC-43</span>)</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators carried out this program by compulsory
sale where necessary and by purchases financed out of

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'><span class='it'>Belgium</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediate steps were taken to implement these measures in
Belgium. The annual report of the Commissar at the National
Bank from May 1940-41 states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to the directions of the Reichsmarshal Goering
as early as September 1940 the first measures for a closer
formation of capital ties between the Belgian and German
economy were taken. Two different procedures were concerned
here:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Direct negotiations between German industrialists and
Belgian industrialists, for the purpose of obtaining constructive
participations in important Belgian enterprises which
offer the basis for collaboration between the two economies
even after the war. Furthermore, it is desired to transfer
to German hands important Belgian participations in foreign
enterprises whose administration is located in Belgium, particularly
so far as enterprises are concerned which are located
<span class='pageno' title='1062' id='Page_1062'></span>
in the Balkans and in which a general German interest
exists.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Ties which result from purchases of stock by German
parties on the Belgian stock markets. For this purpose the
Reich Economic Minister has given general permission to 32
German banks to obtain participation rights, particularly
stocks, in a limited quantity in Belgium. Till now use has
been made of this permission in the amount of about 25
million RM, to which can be added an additional 10 million
RM for the procurement of Belgian participations in Rumania,
Bulgaria, and the former Poland.” (<span class='it'>ECR-24</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his report for November 1940 the Military Commander for
Belgium stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“A certain readiness exists on the part of the Belgians to
give up investments in stocks in such countries which, at the
present time, are being ruled militarily or economically by
Germany. Among the important business deals of this kind
which have been concluded should be mentioned the taking
over by the <span class='it'>Kreditanstalt, Wien</span> (Credit Institute, Vienna)
of an essential interest in the <span class='it'>Allgemeiner Jugoslawischer
Bankverein</span> (General Yugoslav Bank Association) from the
<span class='it'>Societé Generale</span> (capital approximately 1 million RM) and
the taking over by the <span class='it'>Deutsche Bank</span> of the overwhelming
majority [translator’s note: of shares] of the <span class='it'>Banca Commerciala
Romana</span> from the <span class='it'>Societé Generale</span> (capital approximately
2 million RM). The <span class='it'>Deutsche Bank</span> also succeeded
in acquiring shares of the <span class='it'>Kreditanstalt, Wien</span>, of approximately
800,000 RM nominally from the <span class='it'>Societé Generale</span> and
from one of its subsidiaries. Negotiations between the
<span class='it'>Deutsche Bank</span> and the <span class='it'>Societé Generale</span> on the transfer of
approximately 25% of the capital of the <span class='it'>Banque Generale du
Luxembourg</span> are about to be concluded. Through this deal
the <span class='it'>Deutsche Bank</span> together with the other German groups
obtains the absolute majority of the Luxembourger Bank
(approximately 70% of the shares). The <span class='it'>Deutsche Bank</span>
gets the right to acquire another 25% of the shares which
for the time being, remained with the <span class='it'>Societé Generale</span>.”
(<span class='it'>EC-34</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>While the Military Commander of Belgium may have given
some assurance that the owners would not be compelled to sell
(<span class='it'>ECH-22</span>), in at least one instance, purchase could be effected
only by military order (<span class='it'>EC-335</span>). In this instance the procurement
for the Main Branch of Trustees East of shares of the Belgian
<span class='pageno' title='1063' id='Page_1063'></span>
“Trust Metallurgique” in electricity and road enterprises of
East Silesia and the General Government, as well as purchase of
shares in the iron works Ostrovica for the Reichswerk Hermann
Goering had “to be done, at the request of the Reich Ministry for
Economics, forcibly, as an agreement on a financial basis could
not be obtained.” (<span class='it'>EC-335</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German acquisition of Belgian stock participations was
financed through the Belgium-German clearing. The Belgian
clearing balances of 20 March 1940 included an item of 296 millions
bfrs., which “is explained by out-payment of large clearing
transfers to purchase Belgian capital participations in Balkan
enterprises” (<span class='it'>ECR-14</span>). Increasing transfers resulting from the
German capital penetration program precipitated a controversy
with the Emission Bank, which was resolved by the Commissar’s
issuance of an order requiring the bank to make payment (<span class='it'>ECR-24</span>).
As a sequel, “capital” payments were separated from those
for “goods and services” and financed by a separate “capital”
clearing agreement covering purchases of securities and other
“capital” transactions (<span class='it'>ECR-24</span>). The Belgian clearing “credit”
under the capital clearing, as of 31 July 1943, amounted to 1,071,000,000
bfrs (<span class='it'>ECR-173</span>). As shown below, (see <span class='it'>infra</span>, D, 2) the
Belgian credit under the capital clearing traffic represents a forced
loan, exacted for a purpose not even remotely related to the needs
of the occupation army.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'><span class='it'>France and Holland</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The limited evidence, in the presently available German documents
indicates that similar methods were employed in French
and Dutch participations. The procedure followed in the Netherlands
is indicated below in the discussion of the removal of restrictions
on the free transfer of Reichsmarks in that country.
(See <span class='it'>infra</span>, D, 5.) In France, participations of a value of 121,000,000
RM were purchased for German interests, paid for in part out
of occupation funds and in part through the clearing. (<span class='it'>1991-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except for the early period of the occupation, during which
<span class='it'>Reichskreditkassen</span> certificates were issued to finance the needs of
the occupation troops (Lemkin, <span class='it'>Axis Rule In Occupied Europe</span>,

<span class='pageno' title='1064' id='Page_1064'></span>
the levy of excessive occupation charges, the imposition of clearing
arrangements under which the local central banks were compelled
to finance exports to the Reich, and by requisition of gold
and foreign exchange.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'><span class='it'>Belgium</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators demanded from Belgium both “internal
occupation costs” and “external occupation costs” (<span class='it'>ECR-32</span>). The
former was defined as “those sums which are gotten out of the
country to finance the needs of the German military formations
located in the country” (<span class='it'>ECR-32</span>). The term “external occupation
costs” was used interchangeably with the title “antibolshevistic
contribution” (<span class='it'>EC-401</span>). Under whatever theory, the exaction
of occupation charges was made “to the limit of capacity”. (<span class='it'>ECR-59</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the period of German occupation, a substantial
part of the contribution charges obtained from Belgium was used
as a matter of regular practice “not for occupation cost purposes”
(<span class='it'>ECR-166</span>; <span class='it'>ECR-155-A</span>; <span class='it'>ECR-35</span>), including:</p>

<p class='noindent'>Therefrom it appears that the decrease of reserves of occupation
cost funds amounting to 3,000 mill. RM on 15 January

<p class='pindent'>Occupation charges were fixed at about 100,000,000 gulden a
month (<span class='it'>ECR-174</span>; <span class='it'>EC-86</span>). (100 RM = 75 gulden, approximately
(<span class='it'>EC-468</span>)).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Expenditures were divided between “occupation” purposes and
“nonoccupation” purposes, according to whether “the products
purchased or produced on orders of the armed forces of the
Netherlands remain in the Netherlands (occupation cost) or leave
the Netherlands (nonoccupation cost)” (<span class='it'>ECR-174</span>). During
the 20-month period from March 1941 to October 1942, inclusive
(the only period for which figures are available), out of the total
<span class='pageno' title='1067' id='Page_1067'></span>
occupation charges of 1,545,500,000 gulden, 433,800,000 gulden
were expended for “nonoccupation” purposes (<span class='it'>ECR-175-193</span>).
A large part of the “pure” occupation expenditure, moreover,
was for general war expenses, including the construction of fortifications
and airfields, and the letting of shipbuilding contracts.
(<span class='it'>ECR-180, 181, 183, 187, 191</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In theory, only the “occupation” costs were supposed to be
charged to the Netherlands (<span class='it'>ECR-174</span>); until April 1941, the
“nonoccupation” expenditures were returned to the Military Commander
in the Netherlands (<span class='it'>ECR-175</span>). The claim of the
Netherlands to the sums “returned,” however, was rejected.
Moreover, as appears from the above cited reports (<span class='it'>ECR-175-193</span>),
nonoccupation expenditure continued even after April 1941,
when reimbursements ceased. (<span class='it'>ECR-176</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the first year of the occupation Germany exacted an
additional levy from the Netherlands under the heading of “external
occupation costs,” amounting to 500,000,000 RM (<span class='it'>ECR-194</span>).
Of this sum, 100,000,000 RM was paid in gold; the remainder
was paid by a transfer of the clearing balance of the
Netherlands Bank at the <span class='it'>Verrechnungskasse</span> to the German
Ministry of Finance, that is, was used to reduce a credit which
arose by reason of exports to the Reich. (<span class='it'>ECR-194</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In April 1942, “at the instigation of the Reich Commissioner
Seyss-Inquart,” the Netherlands began to pay a “voluntary contribution
to the war against Bolshevism” of 50,000,000 guilders
per month, retroactive to 1 July 1941, of which 10,000,000 per
month was paid in gold (<span class='it'>ECR-195</span>). By 31 March 1944, this
“contribution” amounted to 2,150,000,000 RM. (<span class='it'>EC-86</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is immaterial whether this “contribution” was made at the
direction of Seyss-Inquart or was in fact the “voluntary” act
of the then President of the Netherlands Bank and Treasurer
in the Ministry of Finance, Van Tonningen. Van Tonningen
was appointed by Seyss-Inquart and acted in the German interest.
His acts, like that of civilian administrators in occupied territories
generally, must be charged to the occupant. (See <span class='it'>infra</span>,
<span class='it'>Conclusion</span>.) The spirit in which he discharged his duties is sympathetically
described by the German Commissar at the Netherlands
Bank as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The new President of the Netherlands Bank, Mr. Rost Van
Tonningen, is, in contrast to a large part of the leadership,
penetrated in his movements and his official acts by the
greater German thought, and convinced of the necessity of
the creation of a greater European economic space. This
ideological attitude in itself gives him the correct position
<span class='pageno' title='1068' id='Page_1068'></span>
on financial and monetary policy questions for his country
in relation to the greater German economic space. Furthermore,
it makes easier cooperation with my office, a fact
which deserves special mention in consideration of the frequently
observed passive conduct of the Netherlands
agencies before the entrance into office of the new President.
I consider as a fortunate solution the fact that the Reichskommissar
for the Occupied Dutch Areas has also entrusted
Mr. Rost Van Tonningen with the Treasury of the Ministry
of Finance (<span class='it'>Schatzamt des Finanzministeriums</span>). Mr. Rost
Van Tonningen took over this office at the end of the month
of April. Thus there is a guarantee that the financial and
monetary policy of the country will be conducted according
to unified points of view.” (<span class='it'>ECR-196</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators financed exports from the occupied
countries to Germany by means of forced loans under the guise
of clearing agreements.</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'><span class='it'>Belgium</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The principle of the clearing system is as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importer makes a deposit of the purchase price in his own
currency at the national clearing agency of his country, which
places the same amount to the credit of the clearing agency of
the exporting country. The latter institution then pays the exporter
in his own currency. Thus if trade between two countries
is unequal the clearing agency of one acquires a claim against
the agency of the other which, however, is satisfied only when a
shift in the balance of trade gives rise to an offsetting claim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the order establishing the German-Belgium clearing, the
Belgium clearing agency was the National Bank of Belgium
(<span class='it'>3608-PS</span>). The administration of the clearing was shortly
thereafter transferred to Emission Bank, an organization originally
incorporated by Belgian interests pursuant to order of the
Military Commander of 27 June 1940 (<span class='it'>ECR-24</span>). The change
was one in name only, however, since at this time the management
of the two banks was substantially identical and the Emission
Bank obtained its currency by loan from the National Bank.
The Emission Bank was, by its charter terms, subject to orders
of the Commissar at the National Bank; the Commissar obtained
the same powers over the National Bank by German order of 16
December 1940. (<span class='it'>ECR-24</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Belgian total “credit” under the clearing, as of 31 July
1944, amounted to 60,837,000,000 bfrs = 4,867,000,000 RM, of
<span class='pageno' title='1069' id='Page_1069'></span>
which 54,993,000,000 bfrs = 4,399,000,000 RM arose from the
Belgian-German clearing for goods and services. (<span class='it'>ECR-173</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The continued increase in the Belgian “credit” was due mainly
to “the increasing Belgian export to Germany for which there are
only small imports from Germany on the other side of the account.”
(<span class='it'>ECR-149</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire Belgian credit under the clearing constitutes a forced
loan, largely for nonoccupation purposes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) The Belgian-German clearing was established by circular
of the Reichs Minister of Economics, 4 July 1940 (<span class='it'>ECH-6</span>), which
was published to the Belgians by proclamation of the Military
Commander of 10 July 1940 (<span class='it'>EC-604</span>; <span class='it'>3608-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) “Since it was to be foreseen that as the result of the increased
deliveries from Belgium to the Reich, which were not
matched by opposite accounts, particularly in the early period,
the clearing status would develop to the favor of the Emission
Bank” (<span class='it'>ECR-24</span>), an agreement was signed by the Emission
Bank and the German Reichsbank on 16/17 August 1940 under
which each undertook to pay out clearing transfers immediately
(<span class='it'>ECR-24</span>; <span class='it'>ECH-5</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) This agreement did not prescribe what must be financed
through the clearing; it merely provided for immediate payment
of claim arising thereunder without waiting until the account
should be balanced by equalizing of imports and exports.
As the Military Commander stated, the German-Belgian clearing
was “not regulated by an agreement, but has been regulated unilaterally
by my proclamation of 10 July 1940” (<span class='it'>EC-604</span>). The
Military Commander made clear the absolute power asserted by
the German authorities over the Belgian Note Banks (as the
Germans described the Emission and National Banks). He stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The claim made to the Commissar that the Emission
Bank is entitled to ask in every case for detailed explanation
of compensation payments coming from Germany
is incorrect. The clearing activities between Germany and
Belgium are not regulated by an agreement but have been
regulated unilaterally by my proclamation on July 10, 1940
and are not subject to any Belgian control. Inter-alia the
transfer of all payments which have been specially authorized
by the Reich Ministry of Economy has been expressly
permitted * * *.” (<span class='it'>EC-604</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) The Commissar freely invoked his directive power over the
Note Banks.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'>1. When, in April 1941, the clearing balance of the Emission
<span class='pageno' title='1070' id='Page_1070'></span>
Bank exceeded 1,500,000 bfrs the Emission Bank
refused to pay out several large sums arising by virtue
of German-Belgian “capital” transactions. Thereupon,
the Commissar issued an order directing the
bank to make the payment. (<span class='it'>ECR-24</span>)</p>

<p class='hang'>2. In December 1941, the Emission Bank refused to pay
out a sum of 43,256,000 RM transferred from Paris.
The Commissar thereupon issued an order directing
the bank to do so. (<span class='it'>ECR-172</span>)</p>

<p class='hang'>3. In October 1942, the Emission Bank refused to pay out
certain amounts expended for purchases on the Belgian
black market. The military administrator, however,
“held down the increasing resistance of the Note
Banks which culminated at the end of October of this
year in a public threat of resignation by the Governor
of the National Bank, by the heaviest pressure, and
forced the Note Banks, while emphasizing his willingness
to negotiate on certain Belgian proposals, again
to take up the global clearing transfers for German
procurement agencies which were cut off for a period”
(<span class='it'>ECR-132</span>). The nature of this pressure is explicitly
shown in the following communication from the Commissar
to the President of the Emission Bank dated
29 October 1942:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The Military Commander has ordered me to inform you of
the following:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The requested extension of time for the resumption of business
relations with the Armed Forces Clearing Institute
(<span class='it'>Wehrmachtverrechnungskasse</span>) and for the payment of the
arrears of RM 60 million have been denied. An official will
determine tomorrow at 10 a. m. whether payment has been
made.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Severest measures against you and all responsible parties
must be expected in case of failure to pay.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“If acts of sabotage occur on the equipment and the values
of the National Bank or the Emission Bank, you and the
gentlemen designated on the enclosed list will be held responsible
personally and your property will be seized. Your
liability is a joint one.” (<span class='it'>EC-605</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'><span class='it'>France</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The “credit” balance of the Bank of France under the Franco-German
clearing established on 14 November 1940 amounted to
4,400,000,000 RM as of September 1943 (<span class='it'>3615-PS</span>). The clearing
<span class='pageno' title='1071' id='Page_1071'></span>
arrangement was designed, of course, principally for the financing
of exports, that is, for purposes not related to the needs of
the occupation army. (<span class='it'>EC-619</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coercion in the establishment of the Franco-German clearing is
readily demonstrable. Extreme pressure was brought to bear,
particularly in regard to the rate of exchange established in the
agreement, by threatening to cut off communications between
“occupied” and “nonoccupied” zones in France (<span class='it'>3602-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>3603-PS</span>), a step which would have destroyed the last vestige
of economic order in France. The harsh terms of the agreement,
which required the Bank of France to make immediate payment
for exports to Germany regardless of the balance of trade, fixed
the rate of exchange at 20 francs to the mark (as compared to
10 to 1 before the war), and gave Germany a unilateral option
to cancel at any time, forcibly suggest that the agreement would
not voluntarily have been accepted. (<span class='it'>EC-619</span>)</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'><span class='it'>Holland</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The clearing system between Holland and Germany was of
short duration, being cancelled effective 1 April 1941, when free
transfer of Reichsmarks to Holland was introduced. (See <span class='it'>infra</span>,
D, (5).) It is therefore not deemed of sufficient importance to
warrant discussion at this point.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators unlawfully took over the gold reserve

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'><span class='it'>Belgium</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The gold of the National Bank, deposited with the Bank of
France and transferred to Dakar, was brought to Berlin pursuant
to German-French “agreement” in the amount of 545,700,000 RM
(<span class='it'>ECR-149</span>), and there deposited with the Reichsbank in Berlin
(<span class='it'>ECR-24</span>). Because of the “high demands on gold and foreign
exchange” which led to a “considerable straining of the reserves”
(<span class='it'>EC-401</span>), the “Reich Government felt itself required to lay claim
to the gold of the National Bank for the Reich” (<span class='it'>ECR-149</span>). A
decision to proceed by requisitioning under paragraph 52 of the
Hague Regulations (<span class='it'>EC-401</span>) was not executed, apparently because
of fears on the part of the Reichsbank that title thus acquired
would not be recognized (<span class='it'>ECR-115</span>). On order of Goering
(<span class='it'>ECH-5, part 9, Annex XIII</span>), the gold was then “requisitioned
on 19 September 1942 by the Oberpraesident of the Province of
Mark Brandenburg for the Deputy of the Four-Year Plan, on the
basis of the Reich Contribution Law (<span class='it'>Reichsleistungsgesetz</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='1072' id='Page_1072'></span>
of 1.IX.1939 (Sec. 15, paragraph 1, No. 5, and Sec. 2a)”

<p class='pindent'>As shown above, part of the Dutch “voluntary” contribution

<p class='pindent'>By German decree of 17 June 1940 and administrative orders

<p class='pindent'>It is believed that the same practice was followed in France,

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators used German Reichsmarks as currency
in the Netherlands, for purposes unrelated to the needs of
the occupational troops, which currency they caused to be freely
exchanged for gulden by the Netherlands Bank.</span> The Nazi conspirators,
animated in part by the view that the Netherlands
were “akin in blood to the German nation” (<span class='it'>3613-PS</span>), sought
to promote a “mutual interpenetration of the German and Netherlands
economies” through the acquisition by Germans of Dutch
participations (<span class='it'>EC-468</span>) and Dutch investment in German securities.
(<span class='it'>ECR-174</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this end, restrictions on the free transfer of Reichsmark
and gulden across the German-Dutch border were removed. Conversations
between the Reich Economics and Finance Ministers
in October 1940 led to the first step in this direction, the issuance
by the Economics Minister of a Circular (<span class='it'>Runderlass</span>)—No.
<span class='pageno' title='1073' id='Page_1073'></span>
89/40—which produced substantial changes in the foreign exchange
control along the German-Dutch borders (<span class='it'>EC-468</span>). This
provided, <span class='it'>inter-alia</span>, that RM 1,000 or its equivalent in gulden
could be taken across the German-Dutch border by travelers or
in border trade without permit, and permitted Germans to transfer
to Holland up to 5,000 RM per person per month for any purpose
except purchase of goods without any permission (<span class='it'>EC-468</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>These relaxations were made effective in Holland by free exchange
of Reichsmarks for gulden by the Netherlands Bank, introduced
“on the initiative” of the Commissar, and by enforced
acceptance of Reichsmark currency by the Dutch business population.
(<span class='it'>EC-468</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reichsmarks thus made available in the Netherlands were
mainly used to purchase Dutch securities on the stock exchange
(<span class='it'>EC-468</span>). Permission to make such purchases was extended to
a large number of German banks by the German Ministry of
Economics. The transfers were made with “reluctance” by the
Dutch, in connection with which the Reich Commissar at the
Netherlands Bank observed, “it may be pointed out with some
justification that an out-payment of gulden made against a Reichsmark
credit, which can only result through the burdening of the
Netherlands State credit, represents no genuine transfer”
(<span class='it'>EC-468</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding the objections of the then Commissar at the
Netherlands Bank (<span class='it'>EC-468</span>), circular 87/40 was soon followed by
No. 29/41 of 31 March 1941, which abolished almost completely
all restrictions on the free use of the Reichsmark in Holland
(<span class='it'>ECR-197</span>). Circular 29/41 provided that all foreign exchange
transactions between Germany and the Netherlands were freed
of control, the only important exception being that German investments
of more than 100,000 gulden in Holland required permission
of the Reichskommissar in the Netherlands. The clearing
agreement was abolished, and payments between Germany and
the Netherlands were permitted by simple bank checks, drafts, or
postal money orders. A simultaneous order by the Reich Commissar
for the Occupied Netherlands Areas lifted all restrictions
set by Netherlands foreign exchange law on such transactions
(<span class='it'>ECR-197</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this “introduction of free payments traffic” or “removal
of the foreign exchange frontiers,” payments for exports from
Holland were made in Germany “through the accounts of the
banks, mainly through the account of the Netherlands Bank,
<span class='pageno' title='1074' id='Page_1074'></span>
which takes on the exchange into gulden means of payment without
further formalities.” (<span class='it'>ECR-174</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This exchange presumably merely continued the practice introduced
earlier at the “instigation” of Seyss-Inquart. At all events,
the President of the Bank, Van Tonningen, was a Nazi agent, and
his acts may be charged to the Nazi conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of this radical step was this:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ever since the introduction of free payments traffic the
status of the Netherlands Bank is mainly influenced by the
taking up of Reichsmarks. On 31 March 1941, the day before
the introduction of free payments traffic, the Netherlands
Bank had a total stock of about 83 million RM of Reichsmark
credits, on 30 April 1941 of about 213 million RM, and on 31
May 1941 of about 366 million RM. Thus, in the two months
after the removal of the foreign exchange frontier, it has
taken up about 283 million RM, the gulden equivalent, at the
rate of RM 132.7 equals florin 100, on the basis of the transfer
agreement with the Reichsbank.” (<span class='it'>ECR-174</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the Netherlands Bank was caused to pledge its credit (in
the form of Dutch currency) in exchange for a Reichsmark credit.
In this manner the Nazi conspirators were enabled to exact from
the bank a loan unlimited in quantity and beyond the bank’s control,
by the simple expedient of writing out a check in Germany.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>E. <span class='it'>Argument and Conclusion.</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>The acts of the Nazi conspirators as revealed by the evidence constitute
war crimes within the meaning of Article 6 (B) of the
charter of the International Military Tribunal. Two general observations
should be made at the outset. In the first place, the
pertinent provisions of the Hague Regulations (<span class='it'>3737-PS</span>) are controlling.
The Germans entered into an Armistice Agreement with
only one of the countries under discussion (France), and the
Franco-German Armistice Agreement of 22 June 1940 contains
nothing which purports to confer on the occupant powers broader
than those which may be exercised under the Hague Regulations.
Article 3 of the Armistice reserves to Germany in the occupied
zone “all the rights of the occupying power.” No other provision
is material here. The language of Article 3 plainly does not purport
to qualify in any way the otherwise binding terms of the
Hague Regulations. The German position (<span class='it'>EC-113</span>) that “the
rights of Article 3 are more extensive than the rights of the occupation
power in the Hague Regulations” and permitted Germany
to base thereon “all measures which are, according to her own
<span class='pageno' title='1075' id='Page_1075'></span>
judgment, necessary for the continuation of the war against England,”
is therefore plainly untenable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, the collaboration of certain French, Dutch, and Belgian
officials is legally immaterial and does not serve to shield the
Nazi conspirators from responsibility for the acts done in the territory
under German control. Belgium, Holland, and a large part
of France were under German occupation throughout the period
in question and, after 10 November 1942, so-called Vichy France
was overrun and occupied as well. It is accepted doctrine that
governmental authority is completely, albeit temporarily, vested
in the occupant during the period of its control. Whether the occupant
elects to employ the existing administrative machinery
and personnel or substitute its own, is solely a question of political
and administrative convenience; the choice is without legal significance.
The civil administration of an occupied country, it may
be confidently asserted, has no independent legal status whatever.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The acts of the Nazi conspirators as revealed by the evidence
are prohibited by the Hague Regulations.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>The forcible removal of machinery, foodstuffs, and raw
materials.</span> It has been shown above that the Nazis forcibly removed
large quantities of machinery, foodstuffs, and raw materials
to Germany, including even church bells and the strategic
metals contained in the transmission systems of the occupied
countries. Articles 52 and 53 of the Hague Regulations (the only
pertinent provisions) provide no basis for such action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 52 of the Hague Regulations declares that requisitions
in kind and services shall not be demanded except for “the needs
of the occupation army,” a limitation deliberately substituted for
the less restrictive one of “military necessity” which had previously
been contained in the Brussels Declaration of 1874 (<span class='it'>Conference
Internationale de la Paix, La Haye</span>, 1899, Part I, p. 60;
Part III, pp. 45, 181). It is settled that requisitions for export
to the country of the occupying power is violative of Article 52
(see Feilchenfeld, <span class='it'>The International Law of Belligerent Occupation</span>,
Washington, 1942, pars. 148-149, and cases cited).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The argument, advanced by the Germans in defense of such
requisitions during the first World War (see Garner, <span class='it'>International
Law and World War</span>, Vol. II, p. 126, n.) and frequently
again during the recent conflict (<span class='it'>EC-344-7</span>; <span class='it'>ECH-16</span>), that the
limitations of Article 52 may be disregarded in case of military
necessity, is not well founded. Article 23g, which permits the
destruction of private property when “imperatively demanded
by the necessities of war,” is included among the provisions relating
<span class='pageno' title='1076' id='Page_1076'></span>
to the rights of belligerents in the conduct of military
operations, and has no relation to the powers of a belligerent in
an occupied area in which conflict has ceased (see Garner, <span class='it'>loc.
cit. supra</span>). The latter are governed, so far as material here,
by Articles 42-56.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from Article 23g, there is no basis whatever for the
German position. The Hague Regulations are limitations on
the powers which may be exercised under the plea of military
necessity (II, Oppenheim, <span class='it'>International Law</span>, 6th Edition Revised,
edited by Lauterpacht, p. 185, n.1). An exception for
cases of alleged military necessity, therefore, cannot be implied.
The deliberate substitution of the present terminology in lieu
of the vague limitations of “military necessity” as contained in
the Brussels Declaration of 1874, moreover, would seem to remove
all basis for a contrary construction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 53 provides no better support for the Nazis’ action.
The second paragraph, relating to private property, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“All appliances, whether on land, on sea, or in the air,
adapted for the transmission of news, or for the transport
of persons or things, exclusive of cases governed by naval
law, depots of arms and, generally, all kinds of munitions
of war, may be seized even if they belong to private individuals,
but must be restored and compensation fixed when
peace is made.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This Article, it may be conceded, authorizes not only the
sequestration but the use of all matters within its reach.
The term “munitions of war,” however, clearly refers only to
chattels (Feilchenfeld, <span class='it'>supra</span>, par. 351). It does not, therefore,
include machinery affixed to the realty. The German legal advisors
uniformly so conceded during this war (<span class='it'>EC-560</span>; <span class='it'>EC-84</span>;
<span class='it'>EC-263</span>; <span class='it'>EC-344-7</span>). The suggestion that Article 53 is subject to
an implied exception in the case of military necessity (<span class='it'>EC-344-7</span>)
is, for reasons noted above, untenable. It is equally clear that the
deliberate removal of the metal content of the transmission systems
in the occupied areas is without legal basis. Article 53 in
terms requires restoration when peace is made and, whatever
exceptions may be implied in case of munitions which are necessarily
consumed by use, no basis can be found for the deliberate
destruction of transmission facilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question as to the class of chattels included within the deliberately
general term “munitions of war” is not free from
doubt. The right of seizure is based on military necessity,
namely, the danger of leaving at large things which are peculiarly
adapted to warlike purposes (Spaight, <span class='it'>War Rights on Land</span>, p.
<span class='pageno' title='1077' id='Page_1077'></span>
512). It should accordingly be limited to those things which are
“susceptible of direct military use” (see British Manual of Military
Law, 1929, Amendment No. 12, par. 415; U. S. Army Basic
Field Manual on Rules of Land Warfare, FM 27-10, 1940, par.
332). Article 53, which contains no limitation restricting
seizures to the needs of the occupation army, would otherwise
completely nullify the deliberate limitations on the right of
requisition imposed in Article 52. In this view, raw materials
and even semi-finished goods, save perhaps such goods as are
normally part of military equipment, would seem outside the
reach of Article 53.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>The control and direction of production and distribution
in the German interest.</span> The planned control and direction of the
economy of the occupied countries in the interest of the German
war effort constitute a violation of Article 52. This seems clearly
true to the extent that production and sale for export to Germany
were ordered by the <span class='it'>Ruestungsobmann</span> pursuant to Speer’s directive
late in 1943. It would seem equally true of the earlier
method of control by prohibitions and restrictions. For the net
effect of the priority system was to leave no alternative to producing
in the German interest save to cease operations. And
even this alternative was not available, since the power to appoint
a commissar in case of recalcitrant plants was expressly
reserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 53, which is limited to chattels and has no relation to
the demanding of personal services in any event, provides not
even a remote basis for the imposition of the controls in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In what has been said, it is not meant to be suggested that an
occupant is without power to institute a system of rationing for
articles in short supply with the aim of securing an equitable
distribution among the population of the occupied area. Such a
measure is plainly related to the promotion of economic order
and there is nothing in the Hague Regulations which restricts
even requisition for the needs of the local population. The Nazi
controls, however, were exercised, not in the interest of the local
population, but to fulfill the general war requirements of Germany,
in the Reich as well as in the occupied area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Levy of occupation charges for purposes not related to the
needs of the occupation army.</span> Article 49 of the Hague Regulations
limits the levy of occupation charges to the “needs of the
army or of the administration of the territory in question.” The
only purpose for which such contributions may be levied (other
than for the financing of the costs of administration, a matter
not material here), is to supply the needs of the army of occupation
<span class='pageno' title='1078' id='Page_1078'></span>
(<span class='it'>Conference Internationale de la Paix, La Haye</span>, 1899, Pt. I,
p. 60; Feilchenfeld, <span class='it'>supra</span>, par. 167; Spaight, <span class='it'>supra</span>, pp. 384-392).
The power to levy contributions is reserved in order to permit an
equitable distribution among the entire community of costs which,
if supplies were requisitioned, would fall directly and solely on
the owners of the requisitioned property (Spaight, <span class='it'>supra</span>, pp.
387-389). Accordingly, the levy of contributions to finance exports
or for other purposes unrelated to the needs of the army
in the territory in question would seem plainly forbidden (Feilchenfeld,
<span class='it'>supra</span>, par. 167; Spaight, <span class='it'>supra</span>, pp. 384-392).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, as Article 49 refers to the occupation army only,
the levy of contributions to support the troops engaged in military
operations against an enemy located outside the boundaries
of the occupied country or to finance other general war expenses
would seem prohibited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>Forced loans.</span> Forced loans can be justified only as contributions
and are therefore subject to the same limitations
(Feilchenfeld, <span class='it'>supra</span>, par. 185). The forced loans under the
Belgian-German and Franco-German clearing arrangements,
were executed largely to finance exports to Germany, that is, for
nonoccupation purposes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) <span class='it'>The exchange of reichsmarks for gulden by the Netherlands
Bank.</span> These transactions, whether viewed as resulting in
a loan or merely in an exchange, constitute a contribution of
money for nonoccupation purposes. It may be assumed that they
were carried out “voluntarily” while the Netherlands Bank was
under the immediate direction of Rost Van Tonningen. This circumstance
is immaterial, however, since Van Tonningen was a
civil official appointed by Seyss-Inquart, and his authority, like
that of civilian officials in occupied areas generally, was derived
solely from that of the occupant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>f</span>) <span class='it'>The taking over of gold of the National Bank of Belgium
and the Netherlands Bank.</span> That the gold of the National Bank
of Belgium was private property is not disputed; the Nazi conspirators
proceeded on this view in the original decision to requisition
under Article 52 (<span class='it'>EC-401, second enclosure</span>). Confiscation
under Article 53, first paragraph, therefore, was not open to the
Nazi conspirators; so far as appears they never considered such
a step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be assumed for purposes of argument that gold is subject
to requisition under the Hague Regulations. Requisition
may be made, however, only for the needs of the occupation army.
It cannot be resorted to to relieve the “considerable straining
of the reserves” of Germany.
<span class='pageno' title='1079' id='Page_1079'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The gold reserve of the Netherlands Bank, it is believed, is
private property, no less than that of the National Bank of
Belgium. In this view, the taking over of the gold of the Netherlands
Bank was likewise illegal. There is, of course, no basis in
law for exacting a contribution for the so-called “war against
Bolshevism,” to use the Nazis’ phrase. And, for the reasons indicated
above, it is immaterial whether these “contributions”
were “voluntarily” made by Van Tonningen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>g</span>) <span class='it'>The compulsory surrender of gold and foreign exchange.</span>
The requirement of surrender of gold and foreign exchange for
ultimate delivery to the Reichsbank amounts in substance to a
requisition and cannot be supported because obviously done solely
to maintain the reserves of foreign exchange for the total war
effort, not for the needs of the occupation army alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>h</span>) <span class='it'>The acquisition of business interests.</span> The Nazis’ acquisition
of Belgian, Dutch, and French participations was unlawful.
That this is so in the case of the sales ordered by the Ministry
of Economics is clear (<span class='it'>EC-43</span>). The conclusion should be the
same even when sale was not expressly ordered. These purchases
were financed through the clearing system (which, as shown
above, constituted a forced loan) and out of occupation cost funds.
Since such expenditures bore no relation to the needs of the occupation
army or, indeed, served any purpose other than to
enrich the Nazi conspirators and their nominees, the Nazi program
for acquisition of participations was in plain violation of
Article 49 of the Hague Regulations.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Such acts constitute “plunder of public or private property”
within the meaning of Article 6 (B) of the Charter of the
International Military Tribunal.</span> Save as they may be authorized
by International Law (and hence “consented” to by the occupied
countries), the acts complained of are of a character condemned
by the criminal code of the occupied countries and, indeed,
of all civilized nations. Absent such authority, the forcible permanent
taking of money or other property whether from Government
agencies or private persons, constitutes larceny or, as
known in the international law of belligerent occupation, “pillage”
(Garner, <span class='it'>supra</span>, pp. 472-473). The question of which court or
courts may try and punish for the offense is one of jurisdiction
only (see Garner, <span class='it'>supra</span>, pp. 475-480) and has been resolved by
the Agreement and Charter of the International Military Tribunal.

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Formation, Purpose, Powers.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>On 29 January 1940 Hitler issued a decree in the following
terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The ‘Hohe Schule’ is supposed to become the center for national socialistic
ideological and educational research. It will
be established after the conclusion of the war. I order that
the already initiated preparations be continued by Reichsleiter
Alfred Rosenberg, especially in the way of research and
the setting up of the library.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All sections of Party and State are requested to cooperate
with him in this task.” (<span class='it'>136-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What began as a project for the establishment of a research
library developed into a project for the seizure of cultural treasures.
(<span class='it'>141-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 1 March 1942 Hitler issued a decree in which he asserted
that Jews, Freemasons, and affiliated opponents of National Socialism
are the authors of the War against the Reich, and that a
systematic spiritual battle against them is a military necessity.
The decree thereupon authorized Rosenberg to search libraries,
archives, lodges, and cultural establishments, to seize relevant
material from these establishments as well as cultural treasures
which were the property or in the possession of Jews, which were
ownerless, or the origin of which could not be clearly established.
The decree directed the cooperation of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> High Command
and indicated that Rosenberg’s activities in the West were

Chief of the Army High Command (OKH) and the Chief of the
Armed Forces in The Netherlands that the Fuehrer had ordered
that Rosenberg’s suggestion be followed, to the effect that certain
libraries and archives, chancelleries of high church authorities,
and lodges be searched for documents valuable to Germany or indicating
political maneuvers directed against Germany, and that
such material be seized. The letter further stated that Hitler had
ordered the support of the Gestapo and that the Chief of the Sipo
(Security Police), SS-Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich, had been informed
and would communicate with the competent military commanders.
(<span class='it'>137-PS</span>)</p>

completed after this date are irrelevant and legally invalid
(for example, Polish and Slovak libraries in Paris, possessions
of the Palais Rothschild or other ownerless Jewish possessions).
Reservations regarding search, seizure and transportation
to Germany on the basis of the above reasons will not
be recognized.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Reichsleiter Rosenberg and/or his deputy Reichshauptstellenleiter
Ebert has received clear instructions from the
Fuehrer personally governing the right of seizure; he is entitled

<p class='pindent'>In a letter to Goering, 18 June 1942, Rosenberg voiced the opinion

boxes were dispatched for the use of special trades * * *</p>

<p class='noindent'>“For the sorting out of the confiscated furniture and goods
on the invisible assembly line and for the packing and loading,
exclusive use was made of interned Jews. Because of
its experience as to confiscation, as to working systems

<p class='pindent'>The report stated that the above figures would be increased
since seizures in the West were not yet completed and it had not
been possible to make a scientific inventory of part of the seized
objects because of the lack of experts. (<span class='it'>1015-B-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='1105' id='Page_1105'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As early as 28 January 1941, Rosenberg stated, with reference
to properties seized in France alone:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * the value involved will come close to a billion
Reichsmarks.” (<span class='it'>090-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Scholz, in his report on activities from March 1941 to July
1944, expressed the value of the seizures as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The extraordinary artistic and material value of the seized
art works cannot be expressed in figures. The paintings,
period furniture of the 17th and 18th Centuries, the
Gobelins, the antiques and renaissance jewelry of the Rothschild’s
are objects of such a unique character that their
evaluation is impossible, since no comparable values have
so far appeared on the art market.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“A short report, moreover, can only hint at the artistic
worth of the collections. Among the seized paintings, pastels
and drawings there are several hundred works of the
first quality, masterpieces of European art, which could take
first place in any museum. Included therein are absolutely
authenticated signed works of Rembrandt Van Rijn, Rubens,
Frans Hals, Vermeer van Delft, Valasquez, Murillo, Goya,
Sebastiano del Piombo, Palma Vecchio, etc.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Of first importance among the seized paintings are the
works of the famous French painters of the 18th Century,
with masterpieces of Boucher, Watteau, Rigaud, Largielliere,
Rattler, Fragonard, Pater, Danloux and de Troy.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“This collection can compare with those of the best European
museums. It includes many works of the foremost French
masters, who up to now have been only inadequately represented
in the best German museums. Very important also
is the representation of masterpieces of the Dutch Painters
of the 17th and 18th Centuries. First of all should be mentioned
the works of Van Dyck, Saloman and Jacob Ruisdal,
Wouvermann, Terborch, Jan Weenix, Gabriel Metsu, Adrian
van Ostade, David Teniers, Pieter de Hooch, Willem van der
Velde, etc.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Of foremost importance also are the represented works of
English painting of the 18th and early 19th centuries, with
masterpieces of Reynolds, Romney, and Gainsborough.
Cranach and Amberger, among the German masters, should
be mentioned.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The collection of French furniture of the 17th and 18th
centuries is perhaps even more highly to be evaluated. This
contains hundreds of the best preserved and, for the most
part, signed works of the best known cabinet-makers from
<span class='pageno' title='1106' id='Page_1106'></span>
the period between Louis XIV to Louis XVI. Since German
cabinetmakers played an important part in this golden age
of French cabinetry, now recognized for the first time in
the field of art, this collection is of paramount importance.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The collection of Gobelins and Persian tapestries contains
numerous world-famous objects. The collection of handicraft
works and the Rothschild collection of renaissance
jewelry is valuable beyond comparison.” (<span class='it'>1015-B-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The report refers to 25 portfolios of pictures of the most
valuable works of the art collections seized in the West, which
portfolios were presented to the Fuehrer. Ten additional portfolios
are stated to be attached to the report and additional portfolios
are said to be in preparation. Thirty-nine leatherbound
volumes prepared by the <span class='it'>Einsatzstab</span> contain photographs of
paintings, textiles, furniture, candelabra, and numerous other
objects of art and illustrate the magnitude and value of the collection
made by <span class='it'>Einsatzstab Rosenberg</span>.</p>

<h3>2. THE GENERAL-GOUVERNEMENT</h3>

<p class='pindent'>A. <span class='it'>Confiscatory Laws and Decrees</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In October 1939 Goering issued a verbal order to Dr. Muehlmann
asking him to undertake the immediate securing of all
Polish art treasures. (<span class='it'>1709-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 15 November 1939, Hans Frank, Governor-General for the
Occupied Polish Territories, issued a decree providing in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 1. 1. All movable and stationary property of the
Former Polish State * * * will be sequestered for the
purpose of securing all manner of public valuables.”
(<span class='it'>1773-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 16 December 1939, Frank issued a decree providing in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 1. All art objects in public possession in the General
Gouvernement will be confiscated for the fulfillment of
public tasks of common interest insofar as it has not already
been seized under the decree on the confiscation of the wealth
of the former Polish State in the General Gouvernement of
15 November 1939 (<span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt GGP</span>, p. 37).</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 2. With the exception of art collections and art
objects which were the property of the former Polish State,
art objects will be considered as owned by the public:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Private art collections which have been taken under
protection by the special commissioner for the seizure and
safekeeping of the art and cultural treasures.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. All ecclesiastical art property with the exception of
<span class='pageno' title='1107' id='Page_1107'></span>
those objects required for the daily performance of liturgic
actions.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 3. 1. In order to determine whether art objects are
public property in the sense of this regulation, every private
and ecclesiastical art possession has to be registered
with exact data on the kind, nature and number of pieces.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Everyone who possessed or at the present time is in
possession of or else is entitled to dispose of such objects of
art since 15 March 1939, is obliged to register the same.”
(<span class='it'>1773-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In order to implement the above decree, the following registration
decree was issued in the name of the Governor-General by
Dr. Muehlmann, Special Deputy for the Securing of Art Treasures:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 2. 1. Objects of artistic, cultural-historical and historical
value which originate from the time before 1850, have

information has to be given if possible, on the master,
the time of production, the contents of the representation,
measurements and material (for instance, wood, canvas,
bronze, etc.).” (<span class='it'>1773-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The seizures authorized by the above decrees ripened into confiscation
and assumption of ownership by the General Gouvernement,
with the issuance of the following decree by Frank on
24 September 1940:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 1. The property sequestered on the basis of Article
1, section 1 of the decree on the confiscation of the wealth of
the former Polish State within the General Gouvernement of
15 November 1939 (<span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt GGP</span>, page 37) will
be transferred to the ownership of the General Gouvernement.”
(<span class='it'>1773-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Heinrich Himmler, as Reichscommissioner for the Strengthening
<span class='pageno' title='1108' id='Page_1108'></span>
of Germanism, issued an “urgent decree” to the regional officers
of the Secret Police in the Annexed Eastern Territories and
the Commanders of Security Service in Krakau (Charkow),
Radom, Warsaw, and Lublin. The decree, 1 December 1939, was
circulated on 16 December 1939, the same date as the promulgation
of the decree of Dr. Muehlmann, above referred to

the benefit of the German Reich and are at the disposal of
the Reich Commissioner for the Strengthening of Germanism.”
(<span class='it'>R-143</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The methodical nature of the Art Seizure Program, and the
existence of a general policy of confiscation of art treasures, is
indicated in section V of Himmler’s decree:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In due course the usual questionnaires for cataloguing confiscated
articles are to be sent to the Chief Custodian East.”
(<span class='it'>R-143</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The intention to enrich Germany by the seizures rather than
merely to protect the seized objects is indicated in a report by
Dr. Hans Posse, Director of the Dresden State Picture Gallery:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I was able to gain some knowledge on the public and private
collections as well as clerical property in Cracow and

ourselves from the acquisition of great Art works, of paintings

and sculptures, with the exception of the Veit-Stoss
Altar and the plates of Hans Von Kulmbach in the Church
of Maria in Cracow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and several other works from
the National Museum in Warsaw. * * *” (<span class='it'>1600-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The avowed purpose of the art treasure seizures was the promulgation
of German Culture throughout the Occupied East:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * the result is put down in the catalogue together
with reproductions, and this is a definite proof of the penetration

<p class='pindent'>C. <span class='it'>Nature, Extent, and Value of Property Seized.</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virtually the entire art possession of Poland, private as well as
public, was seized by the General Gouvernement (<span class='it'>1233-PS</span>). In
a catalogue of the more important works of art seized by the General
Gouvernement, paragraph 1 of the Foreword contains the following
admission:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the basis of the decree of the General Governor for the
Occupied Polish Territories of December 16, 1939, the Special
Delegate for the Safeguarding of Treasures of Art and Culture
was able in the course of six months to secure almost the
entire art treasure of the country, with one single exception:
the Flemish Gobelin series from the castle in Cracow. According
to the latest information, these are kept in France,
so that it will be possible to secure them eventually.”
(<span class='it'>1233-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The nature and extent of materials seized by the General Gouvernement
is indicated in Document <span class='it'>1709-PS</span>. The document inventories
the objects seized, and divides them into two classifications:
those of primary importance (“Reich-important”), and
those of secondary importance. Articles of primary importance,
totaling 521 separate objects, are also set forth in a descriptive
catalogue. (<span class='it'>1233-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The articles catalogued include paintings by German, Italian,
Dutch, French, and Spanish masters, rare illustrated books, Indian
and Persian miniatures, woodcuts, the famous Veit-Stoss
hand-carved altar, handicraft articles of gold and silver, antique
furniture, articles of crystal, glass and porcelain, tapestries, antique
weapons, rare coins, and medals. The objects were seized
from both public and private sources, including the National Museum
in Cracow and the National Museum in Warsaw, the cathedrals
of Warsaw and Lublin, a number of churches and monasteries,
the Chateau of the Kings in Warsaw, university and other
<span class='pageno' title='1110' id='Page_1110'></span>
libraries, and a large number of private collections of the Polish
nobility. (<span class='it'>1709-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Items placed in the second category are of the same nature as
those placed in category I. Approximately 500 separate items are
catalogued, many of the items including a large number of separate
objects treated under a single catalogue heading. (<span class='it'>1709-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The value of the objects seized from 22 collections is stated to
be 9,437,000 Zloty. The materials referred to are only a portion
of those selected as being of secondary importance. No valuation
is given as to the balance of the items of secondary importance or
as to the 521 objects selected as being of primary importance.

Purposes.</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Dr. Posse’s report (<span class='it'>1600-PS</span>), a number of items are referred
to which may be found in the catalogue of art objects “made secure”
(<span class='it'>1233-PS</span>):</p>

in the interior decorations of the castle of the Kings in Warsaw

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
